Published in 1946, the book reflects events leading up to &amp; during the Stalin era. Orwell, a democratic socialist, &amp; a member of the Independent Labour Party for many years, was a critic of Joseph Stalin, and was suspicious of Moscow-directed Stalinism after his experiences with the NKVD during the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which are described in another one of his books, <i>Homage to Catalonia</i>. He intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals. For the preface of a Ukrainian edition he prepared in 1947, he described what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm: ""...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, &amp; that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.""<br /><br />This Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book. It was printed to be distributed among the Soviet citizens of Ukraine who were some of the many millions of displaced persons thruout Europe at the end of WW2. The American occupation forces considered the edition to be propaganda printed on illegal presses, &amp; handed 1,500 confiscated copies of Animal Farm over to the Soviet authorities. The politics in the book also affected Britain, with Orwell reporting that Ernest Bevin was ""terrified"" that it may cause embarrassment if published before the 1945 general election.<br /><br /> In recent years, the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt &amp; undemocratic government or organisation, only to eventually become corrupt &amp; oppressive themselves as they succumb to the trappings of power &amp; begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as Zimbabwe &amp; the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose succeeding African-born rulers were accused of being as corrupt as, or worse than, the European colonists they supplanted.<br /> The book also clearly ponders whether a focus of power in one person is healthy for a society. The book leaves the ending slightly ambiguous in this regard.<br /><br /> Perhaps the largest overriding theme in <i>Animal Farm</i> is the famous quote by Lord Acton, ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""",3.95,140,Paperback, ,297,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1635027.Animal_Farm,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1635027.Animal_Farm

Other helpful reference materials include a thematic outline, more chronologies, a map of one the novel's settings, lists of characters grouped by association, and an indexed list of references.

Residency--and especially the first year, called internship--is legendary for its brutality. Working eighty hours or more per week, most new doctors spend their first year asking themselves why they wanted to be doctors in the first place.<br /><br />Jauhar's internship was even more harrowing than most: he switched from physics to medicine in order to follow a more humane calling--only to find that medicine put patients' concerns last. He struggled to find a place among squadrons of cocky residents and doctors. He challenged the practices of the internship in <i>The New York Times</i>, attracting the suspicions of the medical bureaucracy. Then, suddenly stricken, he became a patient himself--and came to see that today's high-tech, high-pressure medicine can be a humane science after all.<br /><br />Now a thriving cardiologist, Jauhar has all the qualities you'd want in your own doctor: expertise, insight, a feel for the human factor, a sense of humor, and a keen awareness of the worries that we all have in common. His beautifully written memoir explains the inner workings of modern medicine with rare candor and insight.<br /><br /><div>

It has educated artists and CEOs; it has produced a long line of distinguished scholars and dignitaries; and it has shepherded students through the world of high-pressure academics for generations. Since its founding, the public face of Milton had always been one of integrity and pride . . . until a sex scandal rocked the campus and made headlines in the spring of 2005. The offense? Teenagers doing no more than what others had done before them—except this time they got caught.<br /><br /><em>Restless Virgins</em> is the riveting real-life story of a group of seniors who were there as the ""incident"" (as it came to be called) unfolded: Whitney, the athletic and sensual beauty every girl wants to be; Annie, who craves acceptance but is torn between the desire for peer approval and musical success; Jillian, the smart one who is sick of high school drama and desperate to go to college; and Reed, a ""hockey god"" who has it all but whose charisma masks a secret insecurity.<br /><br />From ""friends with benefits"" to STDs, today's teens face a wider array of social and sexual opportunities—and pressures—than ever before. Through its eye-opening yet sensitive depiction of a group of normal kids with normal struggles, <em>Restless Virgins</em> offers an important look at contemporary adolescence no teen, parent, or educator can afford to miss. And it is written by two recent Milton graduates who know this world—and these students—like no others.",2.76,321,Hardcover, ,105,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1692392.Restless_Virgins,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1692392.Restless_Virgins

Two of these princesses would themselves produce children of immense consequence. All five would curiously come to share many of the social restrictions and familial machinations borne by nineteenth-century women of less-exulted class.<br /><br />Victoria and Albert's precocious firstborn child, Vicky, wed a Prussian prince in a political match her high-minded father hoped would bring about a more liberal Anglo-German order. That vision met with disaster when Vicky's son Wilhelm-- to be known as Kaiser Wilhelm-- turned against both England and his mother, keeping her out of the public eye for the rest of her life. Gentle, quiet Alice had a happier marriage, one that produced Alexandra, later to become Tsarina of Russia, and yet another Victoria, whose union with a Battenberg prince was to found the present Mountbatten clan. However, she suffered from melancholia and died at age thirty-five of what appears to have been a deliberate, grief-fueled exposure to the diphtheria germs that had carried away her youngest daughter. Middle child Helena struggled against obesity and drug addition but was to have lasting effect as Albert's literary executor. By contrast, her glittering and at times scandalous sister Louise, the most beautiful of the five siblings, escaped the claustrophobic stodginess of the European royal courts by marrying a handsome Scottish commoner, who became governor general of Canada, and eventually settled into artistic salon life as a respected sculptor. And as the baby of the royal brood of nine, rebelling only briefly to forge a short-lived marriage, Beatrice lived under the thumb of her mother as a kind of personal secretary until the queen's death.<br /><br />Principally researched at the houses and palaces of its five subjects in London, Scotland, Berlin, Darmstadt, and Ottawa-- and entertainingly written by an experienced biographer whose last book concerned Victoria's final days-- <i>Victoria's Daughters</i> closely examines a generation of royal women who were dominated by their mother, married off as much for political advantage as for love, and finally passed over entirely with the accession of their n0 brother Bertie to the throne.

Looking over the list of best-selling books or the roster of columnists at top-drawer newspapers, success appears to correlate with mean-spirited attacks and heavy-handed rhetoric. Whatever happened to logical analysis of economic policy designed to illuminate as opposed to rabble-rouse? When I was young, economists Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson wrote regularly for a major news magazine. They wrote to educate and to persuade. If their columns were to appear among today's journalistic mudball fights, they would seem as quaint and unfamiliar as opera would be to a pop-music audience. I have ambitious goals: I want you to find this book to be intellectually powerful but easily readable. You should encounter new ideas, including positions on major issues of economic policy that will challenge your thinking. The examples should feel fresh and contemporary, enabling you to see how economics can be used to understand the present and to envision the future. This book attempts to express what I call passionate reasonableness. By reasonable, I do not mean centrist, indecisive, or compromising to settle differences. I mean taking positions on public affairs based on facts, knowledge, and intelligent analysis of the consequences of policy proposals. I mean trying to persuade rather than mock those who take a different point of view. I mean trying to appeal to rather than insult the intelligence of the average reader. I am trying to fill the gap left in popular economic journalism today, as pundits seek to entertain and inflame but fail to educate and enlighten. Economic textbooks also fail to fill this gap. Unfortunately, the standard texts are too dry, technical, and old-fashioned to serve the purpose. In addition to an absence of reasonableness, today's economic journalism lacks perspective on technological dynamism. When I gaze into the future, I see rapid economic and technological change. While the economy as a whole will grow rapidly, the majority of today",4.00,380,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1700576.Learning_Economoics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1700576.Learning_Economoics

Where were you when the lights went out?A New York City resident for many years, Carol Higgins Clark was there during the blackout of 2003. Not surprisingly, she felt that Regan and Jack Reilly should one day share the experience!<br /><br />As ""Zapped"" begins, the Reillys return home from a summer weekend to the loft in Tribeca they are in the agonizing process of renovating and expanding. They are looking forward to a quiet supper on their newly acquired rooftop terrace. But it's not meant to be. While Jack goes to pick up Chinese food, Regan enters their apartment, unaware that a nervous thief, who preceded her by minutes, is hiding in the front closet. A thief who knows about a hidden safe that Regan and Jack have yet to discover. Minutes later, the blackout strikes, and both Reillys are called into action.<br /><br />A new gallery in SoHo, featuring treasured glass sculptures from all over the world, has been burglarized. As head of the NYPD Major Case Squad, Jack oversees several departments. Art theft is one of them.<br /><br />PI Regan hears from her best friend, Kit, who is in Manhattan on business. She's been abandoned at a comedy club by a colleague from an insurance convention, Georgina Mathieson, who ran out for a cigarette moments before the blackout struck and never came back. Kit gets a call that Georgina is disturbed and dangerous. Fueled by her rage at a college boyfriend who dumped her, Georgina seeks revenge on unsuspecting young blond men. She was last seen getting into a cab outside the club -- with a tall blond. Regan heads the search for Georgina and her potential victim.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lorraine Lily, an almost famous actress, returns to New York City the night of the blackout, after spending three months in England doing a play, and is informed by her estranged husband, Conrad Spreckles, that he'd sold his loft to their next-door neighbors, the Reillys. Lorraine had never told him about the hidden safe she'd had installed in the closet.

Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.<br /><br />Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same ""types"" of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us ""predictably"" irrational.<br /><br />From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions.

The crime horrified all England and led to a national obsession with detection, ironically destroying, in the process, the career of perhaps the greatest detective in the land.</p><p>At the time, the detective was a relatively new invention; there were only eight detectives in all of England and rarely were they called out of London, but this crime was so shocking, as Kate Summerscale relates in her scintillating new book, that Scotland Yard sent its best man to investigate, Inspector Jonathan Whicher. </p><p>Whicher quickly believed the unbelievable—that someone within the family was responsible for the murder of young Saville Kent. Without sufficient evidence or a confession, though, his case was circumstantial and he returned to London a broken man. Though he would be vindicated five years later, the real legacy of Jonathan Whicher lives on in fiction: the tough, quirky, knowing, and all-seeing detective that we know and love today…from the cryptic Sgt. Cuff in Wilkie Collins’s <i>The Moonstone </i>to Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade. </p><p><i>The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher </i>is a provocative work of nonfiction that reads like a Victorian thriller, and in it Kate Summerscale has fashioned a brilliant, multilayered narrative that is as cleverly constructed as it is beautifully written.</p>",3.52,360,Hardcover, ,1403,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1747896.The_Suspicions_of_Mr_Whicher,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1747896.The_Suspicions_of_Mr_Whicher

But his true story is more fascinating than the myths. We have no surviving image of Patrick, but we do have two remarkable letters that he wrote about himself and his beliefs -- letters that tell us more about the heart and soul of this man than we know about almost any of his contemporaries. In ""St. Patrick of Ireland"" Philip Freeman brings the historic Patrick and his world vividly to life.Born in Britain late in the fourth century to an aristocratic family, Patrick was raised as a Roman citizen and a nominal Christian, destined for the privileged life of the nobility. But just before his sixteenth birthday, he was kidnapped by Irish pirates and abducted to Ireland, where he spent six lonely years as a slave, tending sheep. Trapped in a foreign land, despondent, and at the mercy of his master, Patrick's ordeal turned him from an atheist to a true believer. After a vision in which God told him he would go home, Patrick escaped captivity and, following a perilous journey, returned to his astonished parents. Even more astonishing was his announcement that he intended to go back to Ireland and devote the rest of his life to ministering to the people who had once enslaved him.<br /><br />One of Patrick's two surviving letters is a declaration written to jealous British bishops in defense of his activities in Ireland; the other is a stinging condemnation of a ruthless warlord who attacked and killed some of Patrick's Irish followers. Both are powerful statements remarkable fortheir passion and candor. Freeman includes them in full in new translations of his own.<br /><br />Combining Patrick's own heartfelt account of his life as he revealed it himself with the turbulent history of the British Isles in the last years of the Roman Empire, ""St. Patrick of Ireland"" brilliantly brings to life the real Patrick, shorn of legend, and shows how he helped to change Irish history and culture.",3.89,216,Hardcover, ,17,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1765910.St_Patrick_of_Ireland,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1765910.St_Patrick_of_Ireland

In this intimate portrait, acclaimed journalist Richard M. Cohen probes lives of sickness as these individuals struggle to cope.<br /><br /></blockquote>In 2003 Cohen published <em>Blindsided</em>, a bestselling memoir of illness. The outpouring of support revealed to him that not only does the public want to hear from people who overcome the challenges of illness, but that in the isolated world of illness, there are people who want their voices to be heard. <em>Strong at the Broken Places</em> was born of the desire of many to share their stories in the hope that the sick and those who love them will see that they are not alone.<br /><br />Cohen spent three years chronicling the lives of five diverse ""citizens of sickness"": Denise, who suffers from ALS; Buzz, whose Christian faith helps him deal with his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Sarah, a determined young woman with Crohn's disease; Ben, a college student with muscular dystrophy; Larry, whose bipolar disorder is hidden within. The five are different in age and gender, race and economic status, but they are determined to live life on their own terms. Intimately involved with these patients' lives, Cohen formed intense relationships with each, talked to their families and friends, and shared joy, even in heart-breaking setbacks.<br /><br />Though each individual's illness wreaks havoc in a different way, Cohen shows how their experiences are strikingly similar and offer lessons for us all—on self-determination, on courage in the face of adversity and public ignorance, on keeping hope alive, and on finding strength and peace under the most difficult of circumstances.<br /><br />We are strong at the broken places, stronger than we think. In sharing these inspirational and revealing stories, Richard M. Cohen and his fellow warriors against illness offer a chorus of hope.",3.85,332,Hardcover, ,53,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1767086.Strong_at_the_Broken_Places,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1767086.Strong_at_the_Broken_Places

Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along. <br /><br />Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love -- Rape -- Revenge!""), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. <br /><br />Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. <br /><br />The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation —and a startling, provocative debut.",3.74,276,Hardcover, ,8483,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1768603.The_White_Tiger,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1768603.The_White_Tiger

He experiences harsh living conditions, discrimination and humiliation. At this young age, he has a lot of confusion and cannot figure out what is wrong with a system that sanctions such a life for children. The experiences by five of his friends add more depth to the story. Latif’s fragile soul almost crashes witnessing elements of poverty and helplessness and observing that no matter how hard his father and many others try, they still remain poor and powerless.<br />At the beginning the writer, Samad Behrangi, gives a detailed description of the material world surrounding his hero, the behaviors, conversations and conducts of all players, as he believes the material environment plays a major role in building up the characters of the people. But as soon as the story kicks off, it moves forward with a fast pace of the power and strength of life itself, taking the reader along with it.<br />Readers meet people of different social strata, with voices of each adding depth and excellent character development. <br />Latif spends a great deal of time outside a toy store wishing to have toys to play with and has a fascination about one particular camel who later becomes his mentor and takes him on an imaginary tour to see the other side of the society, gives him awareness as to how the system functions. <br />The real awakening however, is more of a wake-up call.

Se convierte así en observador cómplice de una realidad próxima a la ficción que configura nuestro imaginario vital y cultural. Fruto de sus prolongadas estancias a lo largo de varios años, este libro es un canto apasionado a la ciudad de contrastes por antonomasia. Nueva York esconde tantas caras como ventanas exhibe: las de los decorados de los musicales de Broadway, las de los edificios iluminados del otro lado de Central Park, las que cayeron con las Torres Gemelas aquel 11 de septiembre, las tachadas con tablones en el reverso sombrío del Bronx o de Harlem. La ventana es el marco de una pintura de Hopper, una acuarela de Katz, la presencia ausente en una película de Hitchcock o la literatura de Cheever, el eco del jazz de Duke Ellington o John Coltrane. Como Ardor guerrero y Sefarad, este libro participa a la vez de la novela y del relato de hechos reales: lo que predomina en él es, por una parte, la naturaleza envolvente de un estilo tan sugerente y un timbre de voz tan personal como los que han venido caracterizando al autor desde sus inicios, llevados aquí a una desplegada y soberana madurez, y, por otra parte, una actitud ética y estética ante la pesadilla y maravilla de la gran ciudad que, en la línea del Lorca de Poeta en Nueva York, construye con material verídico una alucinación y una compleja fábula moral.",3.67,385,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1779692.Ventanas_De_Manhattan,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1779692.Ventanas_De_Manhattan

Growing up in a household with an overworked father whom he rarely sees, an alcoholic mother who paints wonderful canvases that are never displayed, an older brother who serves as both tormentor and protector, and a younger sister who inhabits her own secret world, the boy takes his amusements where he can find them. Some of his free time is spent in the basement of the family's modest home, where he and his brother, Jim, have created Botch Town, a detailed cardboard replica of their community, complete with clay figurines representing friends and neighbors. And so the time passes with a not-always-reassuring sameness—until the night a prowler is reported stalking the neighborhood.</p><p>Appointing themselves ad hoc investigators, the brothers set out to aid the police—while their little sister, Mary, smokes cigarettes, speaks in other voices, inhabits alternate personas . . . and, unbeknownst to her older siblings, moves around the inanimate residents of Botch Town. But ensuing events add a shadowy cast to the boys' night games: disappearances, deaths, and spectral sightings capped off by the arrival of a sinister man in a long white car trawling the neighborhood after dark. Strangest of all is the inescapable fact that every one of these troubling occurrences seems to correspond directly to the changes little Mary has made to the miniature town in the basement.</p><p>Not since Ray Bradbury's classic <em>Dandelion Wine</em> has a novel so richly evoked the dark magic of small-town boyhood.

But fairy tales are dark and I had no way of telling either a stranger or a friend what was going on; the abnormal became ordinary.</i><br /><br />Liza Campbell was the last child to be born at the impressive and renowned Cawdor Castle, the family seat of the Campbells, as featured in Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i>. Liza's father Hugh, the twenty-fifth Thane, inherited dashing good looks, brains, immense wealth, an ancient and revered title, three stately homes, and 100,000 acres of land. <i>A Charmed Life</i> tells the story of Liza's idyllic childhood with her four siblings in Wales in the 1960s, until Hugh inherited Cawdor Castle and moved his family up to the Scottish Highlands. It was at the historical ancestral home that the fairytale began to resemble a nightmare. Increasingly overwhelmed by his enormous responsibilities, Hugh tipped into madness fuelled by drink, drugs, and extramarital affairs.  Over the years, the castle was transformed into an arena of reckless extravagance and terrifying domestic violence, leading to the abrupt termination of a legacy that had been passed down through the family for six hundred years.<br /><br />Written with a sharp wit, <i>A Charmed Life</i> is a contemporary fairytale that tells what is like to grow up as a maiden in a castle where ancient curses and grisly events from centuries ago live on between its stone walls.

But now that Martin is dead, Jasper can fully reflect on the crackpot who raised him in intellectual captivity, and what he realizes is that, for all its lunacy, theirs was a grand adventure.<br /><br />As he recollects the events that led to his father’s demise, Jasper recounts a boyhood of outrageous schemes and shocking discoveries—about his infamous outlaw uncle, Terry, his mysteriously absent European mother, and Martin’s constant losing battle to make a lasting mark on the world he so disdains. It’s a story that takes them from the Australian bush to the cafés of bohemian Paris, from the Thai jungle to strip clubs, asylums, labyrinths, and criminal lairs, and from the highs of first love to the lows of failed ambition. The result is a wild rollercoaster ride from obscurity to infamy, and the moving, memorable story of a father and son whose spiritual symmetry transcends all their many shortcomings.<br /><br /><i>A Fraction of the Whole</i> is an uproarious indictment of the modern world and its mores, and the epic debut of the blisteringly funny and talented Steve Toltz.",4.14,530,Hardcover,First Edition,1299,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1833852.A_Fraction_of_the_Whole,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1833852.A_Fraction_of_the_Whole

Hailed by <i>Time</i> as ""brilliant literary comedy as well as a brilliant sketch of the times,"" <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i> opens just after World War I. Amid the fever of the 1920s and the first chill of the 1930s, Nick Jenkins and his friends confront sex, society, business, and art. In the second volume they move to London in a whirl of marriage and adulteries, fashions and frivolities, personal triumphs and failures. These books ""provide an unsurpassed picture, at once gay and melancholy, of social and artistic life in Britain between the wars"" (Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.). The third volume follows Nick into army life and evokes London during the blitz. In the climactic final volume, England has won the war and must now count the losses. <br />Four very different young men on the threshold of manhood dominate this opening volume of <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i>. The narrator, Jenkins—a budding writer—shares a room with Templer, already a passionate womanizer, and Stringham, aristocratic and reckless. Widermerpool, as hopelessly awkward as he is intensely ambitious, lurks on the periphery of their world. Amid the fever of the 1920s and the first chill of the 1930s, these four gain their initiations into sex, society, business, and art.

Her name is Holly. She's achingly pretty with strawberry-blonde hair, and reads Thomas Mann for pleasure. She gives Peter her phone number on a page of ""The Magic Mountain,"" but in his room that night Peter finds the page is inexplicably, impossibly, enragingly...gone. <br />So begins the immensely entertaining story of Peter and his unrequited love for his best friend's girl; of Charlotte and her less-than-perfect marriage to a man in love with someone else; of Jonathan and his wicked and fateful debauchery; and of Holly, the impetus for it all. Along the way, there's the evil boss, the desirable temptress, miscommunications, misrepresentations, fiendish behavior, letters gone astray, and ultimately, an ending in which every character gets his due.<br />Both incisive and wonderfully funny, this is a brilliantly understated comedy of manners in which love lost is found again. <br />""James Collins has written a romantic, funny and insightful page turner about love in modern times, missed opportunities and the wheel of fate (with a blow-out!) that is so engaging and real, you will find it impossible to put down.

I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.</i><br /><br /><br /><br />So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this groundbreaking historical novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America’s greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Mamah’s profound influence on Wright.<br /><br /><br /><br />Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan’s Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world, and her unforgettable journey, marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leads inexorably to this novel’s stunning conclusion.",3.75,0,Audio CD, ,58,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1846060.Loving_Frank,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1846060.Loving_Frank

When Janine was twelve, growing up in the wealthy and predominantly Jewish suburb of Roslyn, New York, her mother was diagnosed with a deadly cancer and died three years later. While a junior at Cornell University, Janine learned that her father, a popular French chef and entrepreneur, was sick with full-blown AIDS. It was nearly five years later when Janine received an unexpected phone call from her uncle, forcing her to re-evaluate her childhood. Inspired to understand as much as she could about her parents, she finally discovers a powerful link between her father and herself, and her past becomes illuminated like the nightlight that once protected her from the darkness of her youth.<br /><br /><b>Janine Avril</b> teaches high school English and has taught college writing at Brooklyn College and New York City College of Technology.

In the aftermath of his disappearance, his mother, Lorraine, makes daily pilgrimages to her son's room and tortures herself with memories. Equally distraught, the boy's father, Lincoln, finds himself wanting to comfort his wife even as he yearns for solace, a loving touch, any kind of intimacy. <br /><br />As the Ewings navigate the mystery of what's become of their son, the circumstances surrounding Newell's vanishing and other events on that same night reverberate through the lives of seemingly disconnected strangers: a comic book illustrator in town for a weekend of debauchery; a painfully shy and possibly disturbed young artist; a stripper who imagines moments from her life as if they were movie scenes; a bubbly teenage wiccan anarchist; a dangerous and scheming gutter punk; a band of misfit runaways. The people of <i>Beautiful Children</i> are urban nomads; each with a past to hide and a pain to nurture, every one of them searching for salvation and barreling toward destruction, weaving their way through a neon underworld of sex, drugs, and the spinning wheels of chance. <br /><br />In this masterly debut novel, Charles Bock mixes incandescent prose with devious humor to capture Las Vegas with unprecedented scope and nuance and to provide a glimpse into a microcosm of modern America. Beautiful Children is an odyssey of heartache and redemption; heralding the arrival of a major new writer.<br /><br /><u>Advance praise for <i>Beautiful Children</i></u><br />Charles Bock has delivered an anxious, angry, honest first novel filled with compassion and clarity.

In the magazines she reads, celebrities plan elaborate weddings; in Hannah’s own life, her parents’ marriage is crumbling. And somewhere in between these two extremes--just maybe--lie the answers to love’s most bewildering questions. But over the next decade and a half, as she moves from Philadelphia to Boston to Albuquerque, Hannah finds that the questions become more rather than less complicated: At what point can you no longer blame your adult failures on your messed-up childhood? Is settling for someone who’s not your soul mate an act of maturity or an admission of defeat? And if you move to another state for a guy who might not love you back, are you being plucky or just pathetic?<br /><br />None of the relationships in Hannah’s life are without complications. There’s her father, whose stubbornness Hannah realizes she’s unfortunately inherited; her gorgeous cousin, Fig, whose misbehavior alternately intrigues and irritates Hannah; Henry, whom Hannah first falls for in college, while he’s dating Fig; and the boyfriends who love her more or less than she deserves, who adore her or break her heart. By the time she’s in her late twenties, Hannah has finally figured out what she wants most--but she doesn’t yet know whether she’ll find the courage to go after it. <br /><br />Full of honesty and humor, <i>The Man of My Dreams</i> is an unnervingly insightful and beautifully written examination of the outside forces and personal choices that make us who we are.",3.26, , , ,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1861595.Man_Of_My_Dreams,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1861595.Man_Of_My_Dreams

A published novelist, Bickerton (once described as ""part scholar, part swashbuckling man of action"") does not present his findings in the usual dry academic manner. Instead, you become a companion on his journey of discovery. You learn things as he learned them, share his disappointments and triumphs, explore the exotic locales where he worked, and meet the colorful characters he encountered along the way.

Longtime readers will enjoy this aspect immensely; I know I did. This has been a gorgeously written series, populated with unique and unforgettable characters.” <br />—CA Reviews <br /><br />Summers at the Hewitts family’s palatial Cape Cod “cottage” are always bittersweet for governess Nell Sweeney, for it was on the Cape that she lost all but one of her siblings to disease. Then she married Duncan, a ne’er-do-well charmer who abused her and coaxed her into petty crime before being condemned to spend the rest of his life in prison. Her dark past has been a deeply buried secret for years—but soon she’ll learn that it wasn’t buried quite deeply enough. <br /><br />Nell has proven herself an exemplary governess, and she is deeply devoted to little Gracie. But now the possibility that she might be carrying Will Hewitt’s child threatens to destroy everything she’s worked so hard for. Even if she were free to marry, she doubts that Will, a rootless cardsharp and recovering addict, could ever truly settle down. Not that marriage is even an option, since Duncan adamantly refuses to grant her a divorce. When the pregnancy is discovered, she’ll be ruined. <br /><br />Nell is dealt another blow when she finds out that her beloved brother Jamie has been discovered dead in a burned-out farm shed—and that he was wanted for murder. With help from an injured Will and her former mentor, Dr. Greaves, Nell attempts to clear Jamie’s name, a mission that takes her from the criminal underworld to the top ranks of Cape Cod society. <br /><br />Originally published by Berkley Prime Crime",4.20,278,Paperback, ,61,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1873469.A_Bucket_of_Ashes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1873469.A_Bucket_of_Ashes

This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.<br /><br />But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?<br /><br />There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.<br /><br />The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.<br /><br />That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.<br /><br />But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life",4.12, , , ,26,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1878684._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1878684._

By the end of the year he was also the victim of a rare kind of stroke to the brainstem.  After 20 days in a coma, Bauby awoke into a body which had all but stopped working: only his left eye functioned, allowing him to see and, by blinking it, to make clear that his mind was unimpaired. Almost miraculously, he was soon able to express himself in the richest detail: dictating a word at a time, blinking to select each letter as the alphabet was recited to him slowly, over and over again. In the same way, he was able eventually to compose this extraordinary book.<br /><br />By turns wistful, mischievous, angry, and witty, Bauby bears witness to his determination to live as fully in his mind as he had been able to do in his body. He explains the joy, and deep sadness, of seeing his children and of hearing his aged father's voice on the phone. In magical sequences, he imagines traveling to other places and times and of lying next to the woman he loves. Fed only intravenously, he imagines preparing and tasting the full flavor of delectable dishes.

With the help of a local crematorium, he investigates and discovers a truth too horrifying to believe: A facility in another state has not been disposing of bodies properly, instead scattering them all around the grounds. </p> <p> Little does Brockton know that his research is about to collide with reality—with the force of a lit match meeting spilled gasoline. En route to trial, his nemesis, medical examiner Garland Hamilton, has escaped from custody. What follows is a deadly game of cat and mouse, played for the ultimate stakes: Brockton's own life. With help from his loyal graduate assistant, Miranda, and ace criminalist Art Bohanan, Brockton eventually tracks Hamilton, but when the police arrive, they find only a smoldering ruin.

This twenty-eight-year-old may have a checkered past littered with romantic mistakes, excessive drinking, and creative vandalism; she may be addicted to Get Smart reruns and prefer entering homes through windows rather than doors -- but the upshot is she's good at her job as a licensed private investigator with her family's firm, Spellman Investigations. Invading people's privacy comes naturally to Izzy. In fact, it comes naturally to all the Spellmans. If only they could leave their work at the office. To be a Spellman is to snoop on a Spellman; tail a Spellman; dig up dirt on, blackmail, and wiretap a Spellman. <br /><br />Part Nancy Drew, part Dirty Harry, Izzy walks an indistinguishable line between Spellman family member and Spellman employee. Duties include: completing assignments from the bosses, aka Mom and Dad (preferably without scrutiny); appeasing her chronically perfect lawyer brother (often under duress); setting an example for her fourteen-year-old sister, Rae (who's become addicted to ""recreational surveillance""); and tracking down her uncle (who randomly disappears on benders dubbed ""Lost Weekends""). <br /><br />But when Izzy's parents hire Rae to follow her (for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of Izzy's new boyfriend), Izzy snaps and decides that the only way she will ever be normal is if she gets out of the family business. But there's a hitch: she must take one last job before they'll let her go -- a fifteen-year-old, ice-cold missing person case.

We now know that male marmosets help take care of their offspring. Is this heartening news for today's stay-at-home dads? Recent studies show that many female birds once thought to be monogamous actually have chicks that are fathered outside the primary breeding pair. Does this information spell doom for traditional marriages? And bonobo apes take part in female-female sexual encounters. Does this mean that human homosexuality is natural? This highly provocative book clearly shows that these are the wrong kinds of questions to ask about animal behavior. Marlene Zuk, a respected biologist and a feminist, gives an eye-opening tour of some of the latest developments in our knowledge of animal sexuality and evolutionary biology. <i>Sexual Selections </i>exposes the anthropomorphism and gender politics that have colored our understanding of the natural world and shows how feminism can help move us away from our ideological biases.<br /><br />As she tells many amazing stories about animal behavior--whether of birds and apes or of rats and cockroaches--Zuk takes us to the places where our ideas about nature, gender, and culture collide. Writing in an engaging, conversational style, she discusses such politically charged topics as motherhood, the genetic basis for adultery, the female orgasm, menstruation, and homosexuality. She shows how feminism can give us the tools to examine sensitive issues such as these and to enhance our understanding of the natural world if we avoid using research to champion a feminist agenda and avoid using animals as ideological weapons.<br /><br />Zuk passionately asks us to learn to see the animal world on its own terms, with its splendid array of diversity and variation. This knowledge will give us a better understanding of animals and can ultimately change our assumptions about what is natural, normal, and even possible.",4.08,250,Hardcover, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1890719.Sexual_Selections,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1890719.Sexual_Selections

Out of the blue one day, The New Yorker calls and says that they want to feature the girls in a glamorous spread shot by a world-famous photographer, and before long these three beautiful nobodies from Brooklyn have been proclaimed the new “It” girls.<br /><br />But with no parental guidance–Mom’s a former beauty queen living vicariously through her daughters, and Dad is nowhere to be found–the three girls find themselves easy prey for the sharks and piranhas of show business. Posing in every hot fashion magazine, tangling with snarling fashonistas and soulless agents, skipping school and hitting A-list parties, the sisters are caught up in a whirlwind rise to fame that quickly spirals out of control. <br /><br />When Amelia, the youngest of the three–who never really wanted to be a model in the first place–appears in an Off-Broadway play, the balance of power shifts, all the pent-up resentment and pressure comes to a head, and the girls’ quiet, neglected brother reaches a critical point of virtual breakdown. And against the odds, even as the struggle for fame threatens to tear the family apart, the Hellers begin to see that despite the jealousy, greed, and uncertainty that have come to define their relationships, in the celebrity world of viciousness and betrayal, all they really have is one another.<br /><br />Narrated in four parts, from the perspective of each sibling, <i>Three Girls and Their Brother</i> is a sharp, perceptive, and brilliantly written debut novel from an acclaimed playwright.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.24,341,Hardcover, ,112,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1895698.Three_Girls_and_Their_Brother,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1895698.Three_Girls_and_Their_Brother

Panivong Norindr uses postcolonial theory to demonstrate how French imperialism manifests itself not only through physical domination of geographic entities, but also through the colonization of the imaginary. In this careful reading of architecture, film, and literature, Norindr lays bare the processes of fantasy, desire, and nostalgia constituent of French territorial aggression against Indochina. <br />Analyzing the first Exposition Coloniale Internationale, held in Paris in 1931, Norindr shows how the exhibition’s display of architecture gave a vision to the colonies that justified France’s cultural prejudices, while stimulating the desire for further expansionism. He critiques the Surrealist counter-exposition mounted to oppose the imperialist aims of the Exposition Coloniale, and the Surrealist incorporation and appropriation of native artifacts in avant-garde works. According to Norindr, all serious attempts at interrogating French colonial involvement in Southeast Asia are threatened by discourse, images, representations, and myths that perpetuate the luminous aura of Indochina as a place of erotic fantasies and exotic adventures. Exploring the resilience of French nostalgia for Indochina in books and movies, the author examines work by Malraux, Duras, and Claudel, and the films <i>Indochine</i>, <i>The Lover</i>, and <i>Dien Bien Phu</i>. <br />Certain to impact across a range of disciplines, <i>Phantasmatic</i> <i>Indochina</i> will be of interest to those engaged in the study of the culture and history of Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos, as well as specialists in the fields of French modernism, postcolonial studies, cultural studies, and comparative literature.",4.00,216,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1904898.Phantasmatic_Indochina,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1904898.Phantasmatic_Indochina

Doug Krug and Ed Oakley show why most efforts at change fail -- and they provide leaders with proven methods for getting their people moving in the right direction. <br /> The key lies in showing those who would be <i>change agents</i> how to capitalize on their organization's greatest asset: the under-utilized talent, expertise, and energy of its existing staff. The authors' program is based on maximizing the contributions of <i>all</i> employees -- by sharing information, decision-making, and planning with them -- creating a shared culture of organizational goals, strategies, and methods. <br /> Managers and leaders at all levels -- from small business owners to corporate strategists -- can use Oakley and Krug's proven techniques, including planning, communication, and motivational tools, to support their employees in effecting the positive changes that will make the difference in achieving their organizations' bottom-line goals.",3.49,272,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908679.Enlightened_Leadership,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908679.Enlightened_Leadership

Without warning, life as they knew it changed as paranoid schizophrenia overtook Sally. Whether it was accusing Laura’s father of trying to win her over to the side of Satan, or buying only certain products that were evil-free, glimmers of her mother’s future paranoia grew brighter as Laura’s early years passed. Once her husband left the family and filed for divorce, Sally’s symptoms bloomed in earnest, and the three girls united in flights of fancy of the sort their mother had taught them in order to deflect danger.

Now at a more succinct 19 chapters, this tried-and-true, widely popular text is known as the ""bible of microeconomics,"" offering the most clear and accurate presentation of advanced microeconomic concepts. For the new edition, proven author and economic authority Walter Nicholson is joined by new co-author Chris Snyder, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. These highly respected economists draw from their wealth of experience in the classroom and the marketplace, giving the book a practical, real-world perspective. Taking a calculus-based approach, MICROECONOMIC THEORY provides an ideal level of mathematical rigor for upper level undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. Extremely reader-friendly, the book is designed to help students truly understand and apply economic models as it enables them to work directly with theoretical tools, real-world applications, and the latest developments in the study of microeconomics. Insightful graphic presentations help visual learners see the connections between the calculus and the algebra/geometry of the same material. In addition, end-of-chapter problems are now presented in two tiers: Simple numerical/mathematical exercises, which build student intuition, are followed by more analytical, theoretical, and complex problems. Unlike other, more theoretical texts, MICROECONOMIC THEORY presents theory in an accessible way as well as illustrates how it applies in the real world.",3.77,620,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1924811.Microeconomic_Theory,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1924811.Microeconomic_Theory

In spring, moved to passion; in autumn only regret.”<br /><br />For young Peony, betrothed to a suitor she has never met, these lyrics from The Peony Pavilion mirror her own longings. In the garden of the Chen Family Villa, amid the scent of ginger, green tea, and jasmine, a small theatrical troupe is performing scenes from this epic opera, a live spectacle few females have ever seen. Like the heroine in the drama, Peony is the cloistered daughter of a wealthy family, trapped like a good-luck cricket in a bamboo-and-lacquer cage. Though raised to be obedient, Peony has dreams of her own.<br /><br />Peony’s mother is against her daughter’s attending the production: “Unmarried girls should not be seen in public.” But Peony’s father assures his wife that proprieties will be maintained, and that the women will watch the opera from behind a screen. Yet through its cracks, Peony catches sight of an elegant, handsome man with hair as black as a cave–and is immediately overcome with emotion.<br /><br />So begins Peony’s unforgettable journey of love and destiny, desire and sorrow–as Lisa See’s haunting new novel, based on actual historical events, takes readers back to seventeenth-century China, after the Manchus seize power and the Ming dynasty is crushed. <br /><br />Steeped in traditions and ritual, this story brings to life another time and place–even the intricate realm of the afterworld, with its protocols, pathways, and stages of existence, a vividly imagined place where one’s soul is divided into three, ancestors offer guidance, misdeeds are punished, and hungry ghosts wander the earth. Immersed in the richness and magic of the Chinese vision of the afterlife, transcending even death, <i>Peony in Love</i> explores, beautifully, the many manifestations of love. Ultimately, Lisa See’s new novel addresses universal themes: the bonds of friendship, the power of words, and the age-old desire of women to be heard.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.61,297,Paperback, ,415,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1935309.Peony_in_Love,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1935309.Peony_in_Love

The unique and potent combination of transition and transformation is a major theme in this book.   The book ranges ranges across key political, diplomatic, social, cultural, economic and religious themes in a series of short, lively chapters whose purpose is to convey the overall drama of hectic change which stopped well short of political revolution.  Britain was still ruled by wealthy landonwners in 1870 as it had been in 1783.  The world over which they presided, however, had been transformed utterly.  It had become an urban, industrial and commercial society, a change achieved without revolution.  [Evans examines whether their success in doing so was due more to good management than good fortune.] This new edition includes a new and revisionist introductory chapter and a thoroughly updated bibliography.  The book appears with illustrations for the first time. Eric J. Evans is Professor of History at Lancaster University and the author of a number of seminal books on the political and social history of eighteenth and nineteenth century Britain.</p>",3.69,504,Paperback, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1943670.The_Forging_of_the_Modern_State,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1943670.The_Forging_of_the_Modern_State

By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood.

  <div>Published two years after their award-winning newspaper series, this is the compelling, day-by-day account of two <i>Sun-Times</i> reporters who infiltrated the small businessman’s world to expose corruption within the Chicago government. Zekman and Smith bought The Mirage tavern, then sat back and recorded the parade of city inspectors, liquor vendors, tradesmen, and others with their sticky fingers extended. With evidence in hand, they shut down the bar and wrote a series of articles that have never been matched in intensity and long-term effect. The Mirage became synonymous with Chicago corruption. The journalistic accolades also flowed in, but the Zekman and Smith’s bid for the biggest—the Pulitzer Prize—was torpedoed, perhaps by jealous colleagues at another major metropolitan paper. This edition includes a new afterword by the authors.</div>

Now living a comfortable--albeit lonely--existence, she's determined to make the most of her second chance. But when a newcomer strolls into the diner where she works, a series of events lands her on a road trip from Arizona to Georgia. After she learns her travel companion has been given a terminal diagnosis and is returning home, Courtney sees this as an opportunity to pay it forward and help, like someone had once done for her. Yet, despite her good intentions, it seems fate is determined to put love and friendship in her path, forcing her to evaluate her own future and what she desires most.

It is also a book they may want to keep out of view of their professors, for it expresses in clear and simple language things that tend to be murky and abstruse in the classroom. These 101 concise lessons in design, drawing, the creative process, and presentation--from the basics of ""How to Draw a Line"" to the complexities of color theory--provide a much-needed primer in architectural literacy, making concrete what too often is left nebulous or open-ended in the architecture curriculum. Each lesson utilizes a two-page format, with a brief explanation and an illustration that can range from diagrammatic to whimsical. The lesson on ""How to Draw a Line"" is illustrated by examples of good and bad lines; a lesson on the dangers of awkward floor level changes shows the television actor Dick Van Dyke in the midst of a pratfall; a discussion of the proportional differences between traditional and modern buildings features a drawing of a building split neatly in half between the two. Written by an architect and instructor who remembers well the fog of his own student days, <i> 101 Things I Learned in Architecture School </i>provides valuable guideposts for navigating the design studio and other classes in the architecture curriculum.

Slash spent his adolescence on the streets of Hollywood, discovering drugs, drinking, rock music, and girls, all while achieving notable status as a BMX rider. But everything changed in his world the day he first held the beat-up one-string guitar his grandmother had discarded in a closet.<br /><br />The instrument became his voice and it triggered a lifelong passion that made everything else irrelevant. As soon as he could string chords and a solo together, Slash wanted to be in a band and sought out friends with similar interests. His closest friend, Steven Adler, proved to be a conspirator for the long haul. As hairmetal bands exploded onto the L.A. scene and topped the charts, Slash sought his niche and a band that suited his raw and gritty sensibility.<br /><br />He found salvation in the form of four young men of equal mind: Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin, Steven Adler, and Duff McKagan. Together they became Guns N' Roses, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Dirty, volatile, and as authentic as the streets that weaned them, they fought their way to the top with groundbreaking albums such as the iconic <em>Appetite for Destruction</em> and <em>Use Your Illusion I</em> and <em>II</em>.<br /><br />Here, for the first time ever, Slash tells the tale that has yet to be told from the inside: how the band came together, how they wrote the music that defined an era, how they survived insane, never-ending tours, how they survived themselves, and, ultimately, how it all fell apart. This is a window onto the world of the notoriously private guitarist and a seat on the roller-coaster ride that was one of history's greatest rock 'n' roll machines, always on the edge of self-destruction, even at the pinnacle of its success. This is a candid recollection and reflection of Slash's friendships past and present, from easygoing Izzy to ever-steady Duff to wild-child Steven and complicated Axl.<br /><br />It is also an intensely personal account of struggle and triumph: as Guns N' Roses journeyed to the top, Slash battled his demons, escaping the overwhelming reality with women, heroin, coke, crack, vodka, and whatever else came along.<br /><br />He survived it all: lawsuits, rehab, riots, notoriety, debauchery, and destruction, and ultimately found his creative evolution. From Slash's Snakepit to his current band, the massively successful Velvet Revolver,Slash found an even keel by sticking to his guns.<br /><br /><em>Slash</em> is everything the man, the myth, the legend, inspires: it's funny, honest, inspiring, jaw-dropping . . . and, in a word, excessive.",3.98,458,Hardcover, ,1016,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1970449.Slash,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1970449.Slash

With a vengeance. <br />""Devil May Care"" is a masterful continuation of the James Bond legacy-an electrifying new chapter in the life of the most iconic spy of literature and film, written to celebrate the centenary of Ian Fleming's birth on May 28, 1908. <br />An Algerian drug runner is savagely executed in the desolate outskirts of Paris. This seemingly isolated event leads to the recall of Agent 007 from his sabbatical in Rome and his return to the world of intrigue and danger where he is most at home. The head of MI6, M, assigns him to shadow the mysterious Dr. Julius Gorner, a power-crazed pharmaceutical magnate, whose wealth is exceeded only by his greed. Gorner has lately taken a disquieting interest in opiate derivatives, both legal and illegal, and this urgently bears looking into. <br />Bond finds a willing accomplice in the shape of a glamorous Parisian named Scarlett Papava. He will need her help in a life-and-death struggle with his most dangerous adversary yet, as a chain of events threaten to lead to global catastrophe. A British airliner goes missing over Iraq. The thunder of a coming war echoes in the Middle East. And a tide of lethal narcotics threatens to engulf a Great Britain in the throes of the social upheavals of the late sixties. <br />Picking up where Fleming left off, Sebastian Faulks takes Bond back to the height of the Cold War in a story of almost unbearable pace and tension.

A former high school outcast, used to lumbering the hallways alone in oversize turtlenecks, Matt seems an unlikely candidate for such a transformation. Yet by dint of effort he lands the coveted position of promoter at one of the hottest clubs in New York in the heyday of rave music and Ecstasy. However, as “Magic” Matt rises to fame, portents of tragedy begin to appear, literally in the margins of the story. Footnotes from one Dr. Hans Mannheim, an imprisoned German academic obsessed with Matt’s dangerous trajectory, suggest that Matt is not as in control of his destiny as he might appear….<br /><br />A gorgeously written archetypal tale of self-discovery (and self-deception) and a love letter to the enduring possibilities of New York City<i>,</i> <b>The Answer Is Always Yes</b> will keep readers guessing until its explosive climax.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.18,384,Hardcover, ,46,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1976860.The_Answer_Is_Always_Yes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1976860.The_Answer_Is_Always_Yes

Why are round-trip fares from Orlando to Kansas City higher than those from Kansas City to Orlando? For decades, Robert Frank has been asking his economics students to pose and answer questions like these as a way of learning how economic principles operate in the real world-which they do everywhere, all the time. Once you learn to think like an economist, all kinds of puzzling observations start to make sense. Drive-up ATM keypads have Braille dots because it’s cheaper to make the same machine for both drive-up and walk-up locations. Travelers from Kansas City to Orlando pay less because they are usually price-sensitive tourists with many choices of destination, whereas travelers originating from Orlando typically choose Kansas City for specific family or business reasons. <i>The Economic Naturalist</i> employs basic economic principles to answer scores of intriguing questions from everyday life, and, along the way, introduces key ideas such as the cost-benefit principle, the no cash on the table” principle, and the law of one price. This is as delightful and painless a way to learn fundamental economics as there is.</div>",3.48,240,Paperback, ,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1992354.Economic_Naturalist,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1992354.Economic_Naturalist

With help from Club Undercover’s owner and employees, she dons a new identity and poses as the wife of the sexy head of security, Logan Smith. Unrecognizable, she works her way back into the Mitchell family’s life to get her son away from them. Falling in love with her fake husband, Elise has no idea that Logan has his own covert reasons to keep her close. <br /><br />Excerpt:<br />“Someone knows.”<br />“If someone recognized you,” Logan said, “why haven’t we had a visit from the police?”<br />“The real killer’s idea of a sick, twisted mind game? Or an attempt to frighten me away?”<br />“Why?”<br />“So I don’t involve the police.”<br />“Why would anyone think you would want to draw that kind of attention to yourself when you’re presumed dead and no one is even looking for you?”<br />“A warning.”<br />Expressing her real fear made Elise too agitated to sit, so she stood and moved around to work off the negative energy. Still…<br />“If I stay around, what’s to keep whoever murdered Brian from murdering me, too?”<br />A conclusion that made her want to grab her son and take off for parts unknown at the first opportunity. To forget neat plans, just go blindly into the night. Or the day, for that matter. Just get out.<br />Where? How, without having the authorities on her within minutes?<br />She would have to wait it out for a few more days.<br />“Elise, calm down,” Logan said, taking her arm and stopping her from wearing out the floor. “The killer would have to go through me to get to you. That’s if he even recognizes you, which I doubt he does.” <br />Logan’s expression was so earnest that Elise knew he meant what he said. But what if the murderer did go through him? What if something happened to him because of her? She couldn’t stand the thought.<br />She shook her head. “This was a bad idea.”<br />“What was?”<br />“This setup. You putting yourself on the line for me when you don’t have to.”<br />Even if Logan had some motive of his own—a possibility that she hadn’t discounted—she sensed the integrity of his promise.<br />“But I want to,” he stated.<br />“Why? What if something happens to you?” She wouldn’t say the word die.<br />“I can take care of myself, Elise, better than you know. I’ve been doing it since I was little more than a kid. And I can take care of you.”<br />“If anything happened to you, Logan, I would never forgive myself.”<br />Elise reached out and touched his face, and a flood of emotions overwhelmed her. Emotions she’d been holding in check for far too long.<br />But when Logan pulled her to him and wrapped his arms around her, she gave those emotions free rein. She wondered if this was the actual moment she fell in love with him… or if she had loved him all along and only now was willing to admit it.<br />She’d been alone for so very long…<br />She trembled in his arms, but he only held her tighter. He almost made her feel safe.<br />Almost.<br />She remembered what she’d promised to do. What she would do. But first she needed her excuse to get into Mitchell House. <br />“I should get going,” she said softly. “Places to go, merchants to see, auction items to collect.”<br />“Right.”<br />When he let her go, he seemed chagrined. He touched her face possessively for a second and then stepped back.<br />Heart steadying, she took a breath that was amazingly calm—for the way he was looking at her was enough to take away her breath altogether.",4.00,256,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2005216.Fake_I_D_Wife,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2005216.Fake_I_D_Wife

En esas sombras, afirma la leyenda, vive la dama del Bosque y es ella quien ampara a sus habitantes.<br /><br />Pero incluso para una deidad tan benévola y poderosa hay límites: el señor del reino, Lord Colum, viudo y padre de seis hijos, triunfador de mil batallas, pondrá en riesgo sus dominios al casarse con la dama Oonagh, una mujer tan hermosa como malvada, que hechizará a los hijos de su nuevo esposo. Sólo Sorcha, la hija adorada, escapará del maleficio. Será ella quien deba atravesar pruebas y penurias para salvar a sus hermanos, y en su derrotero encontrará el amor.

On the eve of its publication, the two reporters responsible for the article are murdered, and the fingerprints found on the murder weapon belong to his friend Lisbeth Salander.

She’s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she’ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. On her own, she will plot revenge—against the man who tried to kill her, and against the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.<br /><i>

Appropriated, chewed up, mulled over, digested, contemplated, and contorted - gathering up along the way fashion, ecology, politics, and art - architectural concepts become veritable things unto themselves in the present tense. As astoundingly diverse as contemporary architecture is, most importantly it is a reflection of what's happening right now all over the world, in people's minds and in the global collective consciousness.<p> The many faces of world architecture today make for a mind-expanding book. Here you'll find the most recent work of over 60 architects and firms, including familiar names such as O. Gehry, Meier, Ando, Foster, and Starck, as well as a host of newcomers sure to be the architecture-celebrities of future generations. Highlights include Jakob &amp; MacFarlane's morphological Restaurant at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Diller &amp; Scofidio's ""Blur Building"" proposal for the International Expo 2001 in Switzerland (an ovular structure suspended over a lake, encapsulated by a fine mist of water, creating the look of a cloud hovering over the lake), and Herzog &amp; de Meuron's remarkable Tate Modern.

While relaxing in the surgical lounge of L.A.’s Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, she half-listens to a piece on medical tourism, where first-world citizens travel to third-world countries for surgery. But when she hears her beloved grandmother’s name mentioned, her own heart nearly stops: the CNN reporter says Maria Suarez-Hernandez had died, a day after undergoing a hip replacement in New Delhi’s Queen Victoria Hospital.<br /><br /> Maria had raised Jennifer and her brothers from infancy, and their bond was unshakable. Still, the news that Maria had traveled to India was a shock to Jennifer, until she realized that it was the only viable option for the hardworking yet uninsured woman. Devastated, and desperate for answers, Jennifer takes emergency leave from school and heads to India, where relations with local officials go from sympathetic to sour as she presses for more information. With the discovery of other unexplained deaths followed by hasty cremations, Jennifer reaches out to her mentor, New York City medical examiner Dr. Laurie Montgomery, who has her own deep connection to Maria.<br /><br /> Laurie, along with her husband, Dr. Jack Stapleton, rushes to the younger woman’s side, discovering a sophisticated medical facility with little margin for error.

She's always known that her daughter ran with a bad bunch. What did she call them — Goths? Freaks is more like it, running around with all that makeup and black clothing, listening to that awful music, so attracted to death. And now this.<br /><br />But the police can't find the girl, alive or dead, and the widow truly panics. There's someone she knows, a surgeon named Weather Davenport, whose husband is a big deal with the police, and she implores Weather to get her husband directly involved. Lucas gets in only reluctantly — but then when a second Goth is slashed to death in Minneapolis, he starts working it hard. The clues don't seem to add up, though. And then there's the young Goth who keeps appearing and disappearing: Who is she? Where does she come from and, more important, where does she vanish to?
