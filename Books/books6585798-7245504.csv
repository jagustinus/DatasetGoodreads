The story contains a rich and compelling record of how these historic events affected the lives of a group of people from different parts of the world. We are plunged into the history of a nation struggling to maintain its dignity and culture in a world which, in reality,understands little about it. Conceived as part of the trilogy, Khanoum spans Iran's history under the rule of the Qajars: a dynasty which rose up during the tribal wars of eighteenth-century Iran to capture the Peacock Throne in 1785. The story takes us on a journey through Iran at the turn of the twentieth century, through the life of Khanoum, a naÃ¯ve, innocent princess born in 1900 in the courts of Qajar. Her life is a gripping story encapsulating the history of Iran and Europe as well as the two world wars. It is a story of betrayal, but fortitude; family upheaval across continents, but national pride held sacred. One also learns mankind's astonishing capacity for pain, and the tenacity with which one carries on by coming to terms with life's agenda regardless of the character and strengths one possesses and displays.",3.89,465, , ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6585798-khanoum,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6585798-khanoum

What to Expect When You're Expecting is a perennial New York Times bestseller and one of USA Today's 25 most influential books of the past 25 years. It's read by more than 90% of pregnant women who read a pregnancy book-the most iconic, must-have book for parents-to-be, with over 14.5 million copies in print. Now comes the Fourth Edition, a new book for a new generation of expectant moms-featuring a new look, a fresh perspective, and a friendlier-than-ever voice. It's filled with the most up-to-date information reflecting not only what's new in pregnancy, but what's relevant to pregnant women. Heidi Murkoff has rewritten every section of the book, answering dozens of new questions and including loads of new asked-for material, such as a detailed week-by-week fetal development section in each of the monthly chapters, an expanded chapter on pre-conception, and a brand new one on carrying multiples. More comprehensive, reassuring, and empathetic than ever, the Fourth Edition incorporates the most recent developments in obstetrics and addresses the most current lifestyle trends (from tattooing and belly piercing to Botox and aromatherapy). There's more than ever on pregnancy matters practical (including an expanded section on workplace concerns), physical (with more symptoms, more solutions), emotional (more advice on riding the mood roller coaster), nutritional (from low-carb to vegan, from junk food-dependent to caffeine-addicted), and sexual (what's hot and what's not in pregnant lovemaking), as well as much more support for that very important partner in parenting, the dad-to-be. Overflowing with tips, helpful hints, and humor (a pregnant woman's best friend), this new edition is more accessible and easier to use than ever before. It's everything parents-to-be have come to expect from What to Expect...only better?. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.

</b> who works with the poor or in missions, <i>When Helping Hurts</i> provides foundational concepts, clearly articulated general principles and relevant applications. The result is an effective and holistic ministry to the poor, not a truncated gospel.<br /><br />""Initial thoughts"" at the beginning of chapters and ""reflection questions and excercises"" at the end of chapters assist greatly in learning and applying the material. A situation is assessed for whether relief, rehabilitation, or development is the best response to a situation. Efforts are characterized by an ""asset based"" approach rather than a ""needs based"" approach. Short term mission efforts are addressed and economic development strategies appropriate for North American and international contexts are presented, including microenterprise development.<br /><br />Now with a new preface, a new foreword, and a new chapter to assist in the next steps of applying the book's principles to your situation, <i>When Helping Hurts</i> is a new classic!",4.25,232,Paperback, ,771,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6595233-when-helping-hurts,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6595233-when-helping-hurts

Against the backdrop of a beautiful but often unforgiving country, these lives come together—only to be torn apart—as a dark, riveting mystery unfolds. <br /><br />With grace and unflinching verisimilitude, Amy Greene brings her native Appalachia—and the faith and fury of its people—to rich and vivid life.

But he has a special focus on one subject - forensic analysis. A police scanner in his room clues him in to crime scenes, and he's always showing up and telling the cops what to do.

For Jacob's mother, Emma, it's a brutal reminder of the intolerance and misunderstanding that always threaten her family.

The problem with this version of history? There’s not a shred of evidence to support it.<br /><br />Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods—that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. <br /><br /> Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like “guilt,” “sin,” and “redemption”) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it.<br /><br /><i>Debt: The First 5,000 Years </i>is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history—as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.",4.17,534,Hardcover, ,1418,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617037-debt

Seeing a homeless man in her neighborhood at the same instant she spotted a man driving a glistening Mercedes, she said, ""Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.""<br /><br />Until that day, the Salwens had been caught up like so many of us in the classic American dream--providing a good life for their children, accumulating more and more stuff, doing their part to help others but not really feeling it. So when Hannah was stopped in her tracks by this glaring disparity, her parents knew they had to act on her urge to do something. As a family, they made the extraordinary decision to sell their Atlanta mansion, buy a house half its size, and give half of the sale price to a worthy charity. At first it seemed outlandish: ""What, are we crazy?"" Then it became a challenge: ""We are totally doing this."" Their plan eventually took them across the globe and well out of their comfort zone. In the end they learned that they had the power to change a little corner of the world. And they found themselves changing too.<br /><br />As Kevin Salwen says, ""No one else is nuts enough to sell their house,"" but what his family discovered along the way will inspire countless others, no matter what their means or resources are. Warm, funny, and deeply moving, ""The Power of Half"" is the story of how one family grew closer as they discovered that half could be so much more.<br />",3.25,242,Hardcover, ,310,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6618844-the-power-of-half,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6618844-the-power-of-half

Her husband-the former Minister of Health and Welfare under the Shah and an American-trained orthopaedic surgeon who played a role in the real-life events chronicled in Ken Follett's best-selling book On Wings of Eagles-was subsequently and wrongfully imprisoned.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now, nearly two decades later, Azar Aryanpour speaks for the first time in <i>Behind the Tall Walls</i>, an autobiographical retrospective of the tumultuous events that resulted in the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and the rise to power of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Part memoir and part historical account, the book presents one upper-class Iranian family, members of a traditional society who became victims of the state and pawns in the transitory world of revolutionary power politics. Most of all, however, <i>Behind the Tall Walls</i> is the intimate story of one woman, caught between clashing armies and conflicting ideologies.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Behind the Tall Walls</i> makes an important contribution by filling a major gap in understanding the impact of the Iranian Revolution on the lives of innocent people. The Iranian Revolution of 1979 challenged America's position in the Middle East and stirred unrest throughout the world. Many books have been written about these explosive events: books that detail the political, historical, and social dynamics behind the events and describe the global consequences of this upheaval.

The autocratic Reza Shah was forced to abdicate under British pressure and there followed one of the most turbulent periods in modern Iranian political history. Iran became the scene of political turmoil involving numerous factions and organizations whose ideological convictions ranged from the communist left to the religious right.<br /><br />This book, the first detailed study to appear in English, provides dramatic new detail on the in-fighting and intrigue which characterized the period. It also seeks to explain why Iran's only protracted experiment with parliamentary democracy was doomed to failure. The authoritarianism and absence of a real civil society which flowed from the failures of this period help to explain the continuing problems which Iran today faces.

Nominated the best moment in the 2007 ESPY Awards, Derek was able to make a dramatic late entrance and performance in the fourth quarter of game 2 to help the Jazz to an emotional victory.

Fisher officially rejoined the Lakers, resuming his role as point guard, and provided a veteran influence alongside Kobe Bryant to a relatively young Lakers squad.

R. Covey uncovers the overlooked and underestimated power of trust in a page-turning look into what he calls ""the one thing that changes everything."" A groundbreaking and paradigm-shifting book, The Speed of Trust challenges our age-old assumption that trust is merely a soft, social virtue and instead demonstrates that trust is a hard-edged, economic driver -- a learnable and measurable skill that makes organizations more profitable, people more promotable, and relationships more energizing. Written from his informed perspective as the former CEO of a $100 million enterprise, Covey draws on his pragmatic experience growing Covey Leadership Center (founded by his father, Dr. Stephen R. Covey) from a shareholder value of less than $3 million to a value of more than $160 million. In this powerful new book, Stephen M. R. Covey articulates why trust has become the key leadership competency of the new global economy. He eloquently informs readers how to inspire lasting trust in their personal and professional relationships, and in so doing to create unparalleled success and sustainable prosperity in every dimension of life. He shows business, government, and education leaders how to quickly and permanently gain the trust of their clients, coworkers, partners, and constituents. Covey convincingly makes the case that trust is a measurable accelerator to performance and that when trust goes up, speed also goes up while cost comes down, producing what Covey calls a ""trust dividend.""

This projected rise in population is the strongest indicator of our long-term economic strength, Joel Kotkin believes, and will make us more diverse and more competitive than any nation on earth.<br /><br /> Drawing on prodigious research, firsthand reportage, and historical analysis, <i>The Next Hundred Million</i> reveals how this unprecedented growth will take physical shape and change the face of America. The majority of the additional hundred million Americans will find their homes in suburbia, though the suburbs of tomorrow will not resemble the Levittowns of the 1950s or the sprawling exurbs of the late twentieth century. The suburbs of the twenty-first century will be less reliant on major cities for jobs and other amenities and, as a result, more energy efficient. Suburbs will also be the melting pots of the future as more and more immigrants opt for dispersed living over crowded inner cities and the majority in the United States becomes nonwhite by 2050.<br /><br /> In coming decades, urbanites will flock in far greater numbers to affordable, vast, and autoreliant metropolitan areas-such as Houston, Phoenix, and Las Vegas-than to glamorous but expensive industrial cities, such as New York and Chicago. Kotkin also foresees that the twenty-first century will be marked by a resurgence of the American heartland, far less isolated in the digital era and a crucial source of renewable fuels and real estate for a growing population. But in both big cities and small towns across the country, we will see what Kotkin calls ""the new localism""-a greater emphasis on family ties and local community, enabled by online networks and the increasing numbers of Americans working from home.<br /><br /><i>The Next Hundred Million</i> provides a vivid snapshot of America in 2050 by focusing not on power brokers, policy disputes, or abstract trends, but rather on the evolution of the more intimate units of American society-families, towns, neighborhoods, industries. It is upon the success or failure of these communities, Kotkin argues, that the American future rests.<br /><br /><br /><br />",3.26,320,Hardcover, ,42,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6650740-the-next-hundred-million,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6650740-the-next-hundred-million

He finds the city changed beyond recognition. The old Marche des Innocents has been knocked down as part of Haussmann's grand program of urban reconstruction, replaced by Les Halles, the spectacular new food markets. Disgusted by a bourgeois society whose devotion to food is inseparable from its devotion to the Government, Florent attempts an insurrection. Les Halles, apocalyptic and destructive, play an active role in Zola's picture of a world in which food and the injustice of society are inextricably linked.<br /><br />This is the first English translation in fifty years of <em>Le Ventre de Paris</em> (<em>The Belly of Paris</em>). The third in Zola's great cycle, <em>Les Rougon-Macquart</em>, it is as enthralling as <em>Germinal, Therese Raquin</em>, and the other novels in the series. Its focus on the great Paris food hall, Les Halles--combined with Zola's famous impressionist descriptions of food--make this a particularly memorable novel. Brian Nelson's lively translation captures the spirit of Zola's world and his Introduction illuminates the use of food in the novel to represent social class, social attitudes, political conflicts, and other aspect of the culture of the time. The bibliography and notes ensure that this is the most critically up-to-date edition of the novel in print.<br /><br /><strong>About the Series: </strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them.<br /><br />In a story spanning five decades, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b>–John Irving’s twelfth novel–depicts the recent half-century in the United States as “a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course.” From the novel’s taut opening sentence–“The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long”–to its elegiac final chapter, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of <b>The Cider House Rules</b> and A <b>Prayer for Owen Meany.</b> It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving’s breakthrough bestseller, <b>The World According to Garp.</b><br /><br />What further distinguishes <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is the author’s unmistakable voice–the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes: “We don’t always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly–as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth–the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives.”<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.76,20,Audio CD, ,38,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667785-last-night-in-twisted-river,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667785-last-night-in-twisted-river

  <div><b><i>Can a woman ever really know herself if she doesn’t know her mother? </i></b><p></p>From the author of the smash-hit bestseller Firefly Lane <i>and </i>True Colors <i>comes a powerful, heartbreaking novel that illuminates the intricate mother-daughter bond and explores the enduring links between the present and the past </i><p></p>Meredith and Nina Whitson are as different as sisters can be. One stayed at home to raise her children and manage the family apple orchard; the other followed a dream and traveled the world to become a famous photojournalist. But when their beloved father falls ill, Meredith and Nina find themselves together again, standing alongside their cold, disapproving mother, Anya, who even now, offers no comfort to her daughters. As children, the only connection between them was the Russian fairy tale Anya sometimes told the girls at night. On his deathbed, their father extracts a promise from the women in his life: the fairy tale will be told one last time—and all the way to the end. Thus begins an unexpected journey into the truth of Anya’s life in war-torn Leningrad, more than five decades ago. Alternating between the past and present, Meredith and Nina will finally hear the singular, harrowing story of their mother’s life, and what they learn is a secret so terrible and terrifying that it will shake the very foundation of their family and change who they believe they are. <br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ISBN13 9780312663155 <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39318083-winter-garden"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>.</i></div>

He's a former Jhereg who betrayed the House. He's an Easterner--small, weak, short-lived. He's being searched for by the most remorseless killers in the world. Naturally, that's exactly why he's going to get completely involved...",4.15,319,Hardcover, ,153,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6678974-iorich,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6678974-iorich

Roads have unparalleled power to impact communities, unite worlds and sunder them, and reveal the hopes and fears of those who travel them. <br />With his marvelous eye for detail and his contagious enthusiasm, Ted Conover explores six of these key byways worldwide. In Peru, he traces the journey of a load of rare mahogany over the Andes to its origin, an untracked part of the Amazon basin soon to be traversed by a new east-west route across South America. In East Africa, he visits truckers whose travels have been linked to the worldwide spread of AIDS. In the West Bank, he monitors highway checkpoints with Israeli soldiers and then passes through them with Palestinians, witnessing the injustices and danger borne by both sides. He shuffles down a frozen riverbed with teenagers escaping their Himalayan valley to see how a new road will affect the now-isolated Indian region of Ladakh. From the passenger seat of a new Hyundai piling up the miles, he describes the exuberant upsurge in car culture as highways proliferate across China. And from inside an ambulance, he offers an apocalyptic but precise vision of Lagos, Nigeria, where congestion and chaos on freeways signal the rise of the global megacity. <br />A spirited, urgent book that reveals the costs and benefits of being connected--how, from ancient Rome to the present, roads have played a crucial role in human life, advancing civilization even as they set it back.",3.78,352,Hardcover, ,95,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6681558-the-routes-of-man,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6681558-the-routes-of-man

Knopf,eng,false,"Jaron Lanier, a Silicon Valley visionary since the 1980s, was among the first to predict the revolutionary changes the World Wide Web would bring to commerce and culture. Now, in his first book, written more than two decades after the web was created, Lanier offers this provocative and cautionary look at the way it is transforming our lives for better and for worse.<br /><br />The current design and function of the web have become so familiar that it is easy to forget that they grew out of programming decisions made decades ago. The web’s first designers made crucial choices (such as making one’s presence anonymous) that have had enormous—and often unintended—consequences. What’s more, these designs quickly became “locked in,” a permanent part of the web’s very structure. <br /><br />Lanier discusses the technical and cultural problems that can grow out of poorly considered digital design and warns that our financial markets and sites like Wikipedia, Facebook, and Twitter are elevating the “wisdom” of mobs and computer algorithms over the intelligence and judgment of individuals. <br /><br />Lanier also shows:<br />How 1960s antigovernment paranoia influenced the design of the online world and enabled trolling and trivialization in online discourse<br />How file sharing is killing the artistic middle class;<br />How a belief in a technological “rapture” motivates some of the most influential technologists<br />Why a new humanistic technology is necessary.<br /><i>

In 1985, Littín returned to Chile disguised as a Uruguayan businessman. He was desperate to see the homeland he’d been exiled from for so many years; he also meant to pull off a very risky stunt: with the help of three film crews from three different countries, each supposedly busy making a movie to promote tourism, he would secretly put together a film that would tell the truth about Pinochet’s benighted Chile—a film that would capture the world’s attention while landing the general and his secret police with a very visible black eye. <br /><br />Afterwards, the great novelist Gabriel García Márquez sat down with Littín to hear the story of his escapade, with all its scary, comic, and not-a-little surreal ups and downs.

YouTube and Facebook dominate the web. In <i>Reality Hunger: A Manifesto</i>, his landmark new book, David Shields (author of the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>The Thing About Life Is That One Day You’ll Be Dead</i>) argues that our culture is obsessed with “reality” precisely because we experience hardly any.<br /><br />Most artistic movements are attempts to figure out a way to smuggle more of what the artist thinks is reality into the work of art. So, too, every artistic movement or moment needs a credo, from Horace’s <i>Ars Poetica</i> to Lars von Trier’s “Vow of Chastity.” Shields has written the <i>ars poetica </i>for a burgeoning group of interrelated but unconnected artists in a variety of forms and media who, living in an unbearably manufactured and artificial world, are striving to stay open to the possibility of randomness, accident, serendipity, spontaneity; actively courting reader/listener/viewer participation, artistic risk, emotional urgency; breaking larger and larger chunks of “reality” into their work; and, above all, seeking to erase any distinction between fiction and nonfiction.<br /><br />The questions <i>Reality Hunger</i> explores—the bending of form and genre, the lure and blur of the real—play out constantly all around us. Think of the now endless controversy surrounding the provenance and authenticity of the “real”: <i>A Million Little Pieces</i>, the Obama “Hope” poster, the sequel to <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, Robert Capa’s “The Falling Soldier” photograph, the boy who wasn’t in the balloon. <i>Reality Hunger</i> is a rigorous and radical attempt to reframe how we think about “truthiness,” literary license, quotation, appropriation.<br /><br />Drawing on myriad sources, Shields takes an audacious stance on issues that are being fought over now and will be fought over far into the future. People will either love or hate this book. Its converts will see it as a rallying cry; its detractors will view it as an occasion for defending the status quo. It is certain to be one of the most controversial and talked-about books of the year.",3.64,219,Hardcover, ,336,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6712580-reality-hunger,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6712580-reality-hunger

But the shock goes even deeper when she learns that the woman who has been like a mother to her has left her entire estate to Julie’s twin sister. The only thing Julie receives is a key—one carried by her mother on the day she herself died—to a safety-deposit box in Siena, Italy. <br /><br />This key sends Julie on a journey that will change her life forever—a journey into the troubled past of her ancestor Giulietta Tolomei. In 1340, still reeling from the slaughter of her parents, Giulietta was smuggled into Siena, where she met a young man named Romeo. Their ill-fated love turned medieval Siena upside-down and went on to inspire generations of poets and artists, the story reaching its pinnacle in Shakespeare’s famous tragedy. <br /><br />But six centuries have a way of catching up to the present, and Julie gradually begins to discover that here, in this ancient city, the past and present are hard to tell apart. The deeper she delves into the history of Romeo and Giulietta, and the closer she gets to the treasure they allegedly left behind, the greater the danger surrounding her—superstitions, ancient hostilities, and personal vendettas. As Julie crosses paths with the descendants of the families involved in the unforgettable blood feud, she begins to fear that the notorious curse—“A plague on both your houses!”—is still at work, and that she is destined to be its next target. Only someone like Romeo, it seems, could save her from this dreaded fate, but his story ended long ago.

Often invisible, his attempts to insure the survival of his beloved Mother Earth uncover any number of hurdles, all fomented by his human counterparts whom by proxy he is tasked to save. The mission takes him from the Wakhan Corridor bordering Tajikistan through the Malacca Straits; to Pulau Simeulue, one hundred miles from the Sumatran province of Aceh; then on to Robinson Crusoe's Island three hundred miles off the coast of Chile. From the complexities of the Abzu Project to cool off the Earth's interior; to the discovery of a terrorist network attempting inadvertently to hasten the planet's demise; to the mind-boggling discovery of the treasure of Vera Cruz, Lyft shows himself to be the ultimate, consummate juggler of human foibles as he desperately races against time in his attempt to cool the planet before it rips itself apart.<br /><br />Seemingly never at a loss for words, Lyft informs us in Lyft Faetels: The Beginning, Volume III, that his parents gave him his moniker as he exited the womb, babbling about the rudeness of his travails in the birth canal. Somewhat tongue in cheek, they temporarily decided on the name ""Lyft Faetels,"" in Old English meaning ""bag of air,"" fully intending it as a nickname until they could come up with a more regal appellation. Somehow, the name stuck, proving to be an apt description of his personality, as he lectures and proselytizes on the exigencies and aberrancies of the human race in volume II, always finding time at the podium when others think he should be engaged in more useful pursuits.<br /><br />Although Lyft is a fictional character, the historical anecdotes, descriptions of locations, and geological references have been extensively researched to give the various settings of the story the appurtenance of authenticity. Essentially a fantasy, the book has a serious aspect to it from which we all could learn a little bit about ourselves and the realization that the planet is a finite place, that if we irretrievably befoul our own nest, there may be no other alternative than total annihilation.",4.00,444,Paperback, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6718686-lyft-faetels,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6718686-lyft-faetels

Jones offers a probing look at the epochal changes sweeping the media, changes which are eroding the core news that has been the essential food supply of our democracy. <br />At a time of dazzling technological innovation, Jones says that what stands to be lost is the fact-based reporting that serves as a watchdog over government, holds the powerful accountable, and gives citizens what they need. In a tumultuous new media era, with cutthroat competition and panic over profits, the commitment of the traditional news media to serious news is fading. Indeed, as digital technology shatters the old economic model, the news media is making a painful passage that is taking a toll on journalistic values and standards. Journalistic objectivity and ethics are under assault, as is the bastion of the First Amendment. Jones characterizes himself not as a pessimist about news, but a realist. The breathtaking possibilities that the web offers are undeniable, but at what cost? Pundits and talk show hosts have persuaded Americans that the crisis in news is bias and partisanship. Not so, says Jones. The real crisis is the erosion of the iron core of news, something that hurts Republicans and Democrats alike.<br /><em>Losing the News</em> depicts an unsettling situation in which the American birthright of fact-based, reported news is in danger.

But providence intervened one day in the form of the United States government, which-after unexpectedly detaining Felipe at an American border crossing-gave the couple a choice: they could either get married, or Felipe would never be allowed to enter the country again. Having been effectively sentenced to wed, Gilbert tackled her fears of marriage by delving into this topic completely, trying with all her might to discover through historical research, interviews, and much personal reflection what this stubbornly enduring old institution actually is. Told with Gilbert's trademark wit, intelligence and compassion, <i>Committed</i> attempts to ""turn on all the lights"" when it comes to matrimony, frankly examining questions of compatibility, infatuation, fidelity, family tradition, social expectations, divorce risks and humbling responsibilities. Gilbert's memoir is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of love with all the complexity and consequence that real love, in the real world, actually entails.",3.43,285,Hardcover, ,4579,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6728738-committed,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6728738-committed

Apenas ha transcurrido un ano desde el final de la guerra cuando una muerte rompe la tranquilidad de un pequeno pueblo perdido en las montanas. El unico extranjero del lugar a quien llaman Der Anderer el Otro en aleman ha sido asesinado y todos los hombres de la localidad se confiesan autores del crimen. Todos menos Brodeck quien recibe el encargo de redactar un informe sobre lo sucedido para que quienes lo lean puedan comprender y perdonar . Asi pues Brodeck entrevista a los hombres mas importantes del pueblo: el cura el dueno de la fonda el alcalde... Y cuando este ultimo le advierte de que no busque lo que no existe. O lo que existio pero ya no existe Brodeck comprende que no le conviene saber demasiado. Sin embargo la redaccion del informe lo obliga a interrogar y a interrogarse lo que a la postre puede suponer una amenaza para el y su familia. Considerado actualmente uno de los mejores novelistas franceses de su generacion Philippe Claudel renueva su exploracion de los recodos mas sombrios del ser humano y sus complejos mecanismos. Los escasos detalles sobre el lugar y el tiempo de la accion el pausado relato del narrador y su peculiar voz al limite de la ingenuidad otorgan a la novela la dimension de una parabola de enorme eficacia e intensidad a la vez sombria y llena de esperanza.,4.13,288,Paperback, ,40,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6731958-el-informe-de-brodeck,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6731958-el-informe-de-brodeck

Situated in Ohio, this idyllic retreat is particularly nice in the summer when the Southern humidity is too much to bear. The main building, with its luxurious finishes, is loftier than the white cottages that flank it, but then again, the smaller structures are better positioned to catch any breeze that may come off the pond. And they provide more privacy, which best suits the needs of the Southern white men who vacation there every summer with their black, enslaved mistresses. It's their open secret.<br /><br />Lizzie, Reenie, and Sweet are regulars at Tawawa House. They have become friends over the years as they reunite and share developments in their own lives and on their respective plantations. They don't bother too much with questions of freedom, though the resort is situated in free territory–but when truth-telling Mawu comes to the resort and starts talking of running away, things change.<br /><br />To run is to leave behind everything these women value most–friends and families still down South–and for some it also means escaping from the emotional and psychological bonds that bind them to their masters. When a fire on the resort sets off a string of tragedies, the women of Tawawa House soon learn that triumph and dehumanization are inseparable and that love exists even in the most inhuman, brutal of circumstances–all while they are bearing witness to the end of an era.<br /><br />An engaging, page-turning, and wholly original novel, <em>Wench</em> explores, with an unflinching eye, the moral complexities of slavery.",3.70,290,Hardcover, ,1862,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6751356-wench,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6751356-wench

How do they see themselves and the world around them?<br /><br />Here B.R. Myers, a North Korea analyst and a contributing editor of <i>The Atlantic</i>, presents the first full-length study of the North Korean worldview. Drawing on extensive research into the regime’s domestic propaganda, including films, romance novels and other artifacts of the personality cult, Myers analyzes each of the country’s official myths in turn—from the notion of Koreans’ unique moral purity, to the myth of an America quaking in terror of “the Iron General.” In a concise but groundbreaking historical section, Myers also traces the origins of this official culture back to the Japanese fascist thought in which North Korea’s first ideologues were schooled.<br /><br />What emerges is a regime completely unlike the West’s perception of it. This is neither a bastion of Stalinism nor a Confucian patriarchy, but a paranoid nationalist, “military-first” state on the far right of the ideological spectrum.<br /><br />Since popular support for the North Korean regime now derives almost exclusively from pride in North Korean military might, Pyongyang can neither be cajoled nor bullied into giving up its nuclear program. The implications for US foreign policy—which has hitherto treated North Korea as the last outpost of the Cold War—are as obvious as they are troubling. With North Korea now calling for a “blood reckoning” with the “Yankee jackals,” Myers’s unprecedented analysis could not be more timely.",3.91,208,Hardcover, ,158,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6772577-the-cleanest-race,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6772577-the-cleanest-race

Beth was a fat, pro-choice, sexually confused choir nerd with a great voice, an eighties perm, and a Kool Aid dye job.

His great-grandfather was beaten to death by the Klu Klux Klan for attempting to vote. His grandfather was prevented from voting by Klan intimidation; his father was barred by poll taxes and literacy tests. Today, Cotton cannot vote because he, like many black men in the United States, has been labeled a felon and is currently on parole.""<br /><br />As the United States celebrates the nation's ""triumph over race"" with the election of Barack Obama, the majority of young black men in major American cities are locked behind bars or have been labeled felons for life. Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status--much like their grandparents before them.<br /><br />In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community--and all of us--to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America.",4.47,290,Hardcover,First Edition (U.S.),6782,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6792458-the-new-jim-crow,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6792458-the-new-jim-crow

More rarely, that book goes on to become a phenomenon of its own. The 2004 publication of the ""Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia"" was such a phenomenon, spawning two further volumes and alerting a fascinated readership worldwide to the extraordinary and hermetic world of Russian criminal tattoos (David Cronenberg, for example, made regular use of the ""Encyclopaedia"" during the making of his 2007 movie ""Eastern Promises""). Now, Fuel has reprinted volume one of this bestselling series, whose first edition already fetches considerable sums online. The photographs, drawings and texts published in this book are part of a collection of more than 3,000 tattoos accumulated over a lifetime by a prison attendant named Danzig Baldaev. Tattoos were his gateway into a secret world in which he acted as ethnographer, recording the rituals of a closed society. The icons and tribal languages he documented are artful, distasteful, sexually explicit and sometimes just strange, reflecting as they do the lives and traditions of Russian convicts. Skulls, swastikas, harems of naked women, a smiling Al Capone, medieval knights in armor, daggers sheathed in blood, benign images of Christ, sweet-faced mothers and their babies, armies of tanks and a horned Lenin: these are the signs by which the people of this hidden world mark and identify themselves.

The sense of paranoia that had long fuelled the conspiracy theories of fringe political groups then somehow became the norm for millions of ordinary people. And to make it even trickier, a certain amount of that paranoia was justified. Watergate showed that the governments really were doing illegal things and then trying to cover them up. Though Nixon may have been foremost among deluded world leaders he wasn’t the only one swept up in the tide of late night terrors. UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson was convinced that the security services were plotting his overthrow, while many of them were convinced he was a Soviet agent. Idi Amin and his alleged cannibalism, the CIA’s role in the Chilean coup, the Jonestown cult, the Indian state of emergency from ’75 to ’77 and more are here turned into a delicious carnival of the deranged—and an eye-opening take on an oft-derided decade—by a brilliant writer with an acute sense of the absurd.",3.84,343,Hardcover, ,50,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6820375-strange-days-indeed,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6820375-strange-days-indeed

Fruto de esa rica tradición literaria surge esta Vida y hazañas de Alejandro de Macedonia, compuesta en la época del reinado de los últimos Ptolomeos por un autor desconocido, posiblemente de origen egipcio y al que ahora conocemos como Pseudo Calístenes. Construida a base de elementos heterogéneos (relato histórico, relaciones epistolares fingidas, cuentos fabulosos&amp;), el resultado es una obra miscelánea, a medio camino entre la biografía y el género novelesco, que gozó de un importante éxito en la Antigüedad tardía. Aun con sus deficiencias formales y compositivas, el innegable encanto de esta narración le proporcionó una gran relevancia que la perpetuó hasta bien entrada la Edad Media.

Based on the tenet that death is neither the enemy nor a finite state, St. Pierre gives all helpmates the necessary tools to become a death midwife. That is, someone capable of acting as a spiritual guide as the dying transition from this life into what awaits them after death. Unlike many books on death and dying, this guide is leading-edge, based on the author’s long experience both in lay and clergy.

He reveals the hidden ecological and social costs of a hamburger (as much as $200), and asks how we came to have markets in the first place.

If we don't want the market to price every aspect of our lives, we need to learn how such organizations have discovered democratic ways in which people, and not simply governments, can play a crucial role in deciding how we might share our world and its resources in common.<br /><br />This short, timely and inspiring book reveals that our current crisis is not simply the result of too much of the wrong kind of economics. While we need to rethink our economic model, Patel argues that the larger failure beneath the food, climate and economic crises is a political one.

By 2000, NPR’s <i>Car Talk</i> declared it “the worst car of the millennium.” And for most Americans that’s where the story begins and ends. Hardly. The short, unhappy life of the car, the men who built it, the men who imported it, and the decade that embraced and discarded it is rollicking and astounding, and one of the greatest untold business-cum-morality tales of the 1980s.

A State Department eager to aid Yugoslavia’s nonaligned communist government. Zastava Automobiles, which overhauls its factory to produce an American-ready Yugo in six months.

There, she takes up with Innes Kent, a magazine editor who wears duck-egg blue ties and introduces her to the thrilling, underground world of bohemian, post-war Soho. She learns to be a reporter, to know art and artists, to embrace her life fully and with a deep love at the center of it. She creates many lives--all of them unconventional. And when she finds herself pregnant, she doesn't hesitate to have the baby on her own. <br /><br />Later, in present-day London, a young painter named Elina dizzily navigates the first weeks of motherhood. She doesn't recognize herself: she finds herself walking outside with no shoes; she goes to the restaurant for lunch at nine in the morning; she can't recall the small matter of giving birth. But for her boyfriend, Ted, fatherhood is calling up lost memories, with images he cannot place. <br /><br />As Ted's memories become more disconcerting and more frequent, it seems that something might connect these two stories-- these two women-- something that becomes all the more heartbreaking and beautiful as they all hurtle toward its revelation. <br /><br />Here Maggie O'Farrell brings us a spellbinding novel of two women connected across fifty years by art, love, betrayals, secrets, and motherhood.

Finally, he turns his attention to urban China, researching development over a period of more than two years in Lishui, a small southeastern city where officials hope that a new government-built expressway will transform a farm region into a major industrial center. Hessler, whom <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> calls ""one of the Western world's most thoughtful writers on modern China,"" deftly illuminates the vast, shifting landscape of a traditionally rural nation that, having once built walls against foreigners, is now building roads and factory towns that look to the outside world.</p>",4.23,448,Hardcover, ,601,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6945572-country-driving,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6945572-country-driving

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br /><br />These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.<br /><br />Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.",3.98,315,Paperback, ,16,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6966555-freakonomics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6966555-freakonomics

To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to.

For centuries, the general view had been that science is neither good nor bad—that it merely supplies information and that new information is always beneficial. Now, science is viewed as a political constituency that isn’t always in our best interest. We live in a world where the leaders of African nations prefer to let their citizens starve to death rather than import genetically modified grains. Childhood vaccines have proven to be the most effective public health measure in history, yet people march on Washington to protest their use. In the United States a growing series of studies show that dietary supplements and “natural” cures have almost no value, and often cause harm. We still spend billions of dollars on them. In hundreds of the best universities in the world, laboratories are anonymous, unmarked, and surrounded by platoons of security guards—such is the opposition to any research that includes experiments with animals. And pharmaceutical companies that just forty years ago were perhaps the most visible symbol of our remarkable advance against disease have increasingly been seen as callous corporations propelled solely by avarice and greed.<br /><br /> As Michael Specter sees it, this amounts to a war against <i>progress</i>. The issues may be complex but the choices are not: Are we going to continue to embrace new technologies, along with acknowledging their limitations and threats, or are we ready to slink back into an era of magical thinking? In <i>Denialism</i>, Specter makes an argument for a new Enlightenment, the revival of an approach to the physical world that was stunningly effective for hundreds of years: What can be understood and reliably repeated by experiment is what nature regarded as true. Now, at the time of mankind’s greatest scientific advances—and our greatest need for them—that deal must be renewed.",3.73,304,Hardcover, ,194,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6985427-denialism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6985427-denialism

As the wedding date draws near, events spiral out of control, and Rachel knows she must make a choice between her heart and conscience. In so doing, she discovers that the lines between right and wrong can be blurry, endings aren't always neat, and sometimes you have to risk everything to be true to yourself.",3.85,336,ebook, ,98,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6987341-something-borrowed,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6987341-something-borrowed

Contemporary art has become a mass entertainment, a luxury good, a job description, and, for some, a kind of alternative religion. <br /> <br /> In a series of beautifully paced narratives, Sarah Thornton investigates the drama of a Christie's auction, the workings in Takashi Murakami's studios, the elite at the Basel Art Fair, the eccentricities of <em>Artforum</em> magazine, the competition behind an important art prize, life in a notorious art-school seminar, and the wonderland of the Venice Biennale. She reveals the new dynamics of creativity, taste, status, money, and the search for meaning in life.

Wander the globe searching for romance and adventure, of course. </b><br /><br />On a trip to Oaxaca, Mexico, to celebrate her fortieth birthday, Laura Fraser confronts the unique trajectory of her life. Divorced and childless in her thirties, she found solace in the wanderlust that had always directed her heart—and found love and comfort in the arms of a dashing Frenchman. Their Italian affair brought her back to herself—but now she wonders if her passion for travel (and for short-lived romantic rendezvous) has deprived her of what she secretly wants most from life: a husband, a family, a home.<br /><br />When her Parisian lover meets her in Oaxaca and gives her news that he’s found someone new, Laura is stunned and hurt. Now, it seems, she has nothing but her own independence for company—and, at forty, a lot more wrinkles on her face and fewer years of fertility. How is Laura going to reconcile what seem to be two opposite desires: for adventure, travel, great food, and new experiences, but also a place to call home—and a loving pair of arms to greet her there?<br /><br />And so, she globe hops. What else is a travel writer to do? From Argentina to Peru, Naples to Paris, she basks in the glow of new cultures and local delicacies, always on the lookout for the “one” who might become a lifelong companion. But when a terrible incident occurs while she’s on assignment in the South Pacific, Laura suddenly finds herself more aware of her vulnerability and becomes afraid of traveling. It seems as if she might lose the very thing that has given her so much pleasure in her life, not to mention the career she has built for herself as a world traveler and chronicler of far-flung places. <br /><br />Finding herself again will be both more difficult and more natural than she imagined.

While Christianity’s historical failure to appreciate or actively engage Judaism is notorious, Christianity’s even more shoddy record with respect to “pagan” religions is less understood. Christians have inherited a virtually unanimous theological tradition that thinks of paganism in terms of demonic possession, and of Christian missions as a rescue operation that saves pagans from inherently evil practices. <br /><br />In undertaking this fresh inquiry into early Christianity and Greco-Roman paganism, Luke Timothy Johnson begins with a broad definition of religion as a way of life organized around convictions and experiences concerning ultimate power. In the tradition of William James’s <i>Variety of Religious Experience</i>, he identifies four distinct ways of being religious: religion as participation in benefits, as moral transformation, as transcending the world, and as stabilizing the world. Using these criteria as the basis for his exploration of Christianity and paganism, Johnson finds multiple points of similarity in religious sensibility.<br /><br />Christianity’s failure to adequately come to grips with its first pagan neighbors, Johnson asserts, inhibits any effort to engage positively with adherents of various world religions.  This thoughtful and passionate study should help break down the walls between Christianity and other religious traditions.",3.79,461,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6995487-among-the-gentiles,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6995487-among-the-gentiles

His intention was to grow rubber, but the project rapidly evolved into a more ambitious bid to export America itself, along with its golf courses, ice-cream shops, bandstands, indoor plumbing, and Model Ts rolling down broad streets.<br /><br />Fordlandia, as the settlement was called, quickly became the site of an epic clash. On one side was the car magnate, lean, austere, the man who reduced industrial production to its simplest motions; on the other, the Amazon, lush, extravagant, the most complex ecological system on the planet. Ford's early success in imposing time clocks and square dances on the jungle soon collapsed, as indigenous workers, rejecting his midwestern Puritanism, turned the place into a ribald tropical boomtown. Fordlandia's eventual demise as a rubber plantation foreshadowed the practices that today are laying waste to the rain forest.<br /><br />More than a parable of one man's arrogant attempt to force his will on the natural world, <i>Fordlandia</i> depicts a desperate quest to salvage the bygone America that the Ford factory system did much to dispatch. As Greg Grandin shows in this gripping and mordantly observed history, Ford's great delusion was not that the Amazon could be tamed but that the forces of capitalism, once released, might yet be contained. <br /><i>Fordlandia</i> is a 2009 National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction.",3.61,432,Paperback, ,19,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7017701-fordlandia,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7017701-fordlandia

If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. The quest for the king's freedom destroys his adviser, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum.<br /><br />Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell is a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people and a demon of energy: he is also a consummate politician, hardened by his personal losses, implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?<br /><br />In inimitable style, Hilary Mantel presents a picture of a half-made society on the cusp of change, where individuals fight or embrace their fate with passion and courage. With a vast array of characters, overflowing with incident, the novel re-creates an era when the personal and political are separated by a hairbreadth, where success brings unlimited power but a single failure means death.",3.87,23,Audio CD, ,130,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7036969-wolf-hall,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7036969-wolf-hall

It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.<br /><br />Written over the course of thirty years by a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, <i>Matterhorn</i> is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature.<br /><br />A graduate of Yale University and a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, Karl Marlantes served as a Marine in Vietnam, where he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten air medals.

In <i>The Poisoner's Handbook</i> Blum draws from highly original research to track the fascinating, perilous days when a pair of forensic scientists began their trailblazing chemical detective work, fighting to end an era when untraceable poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime. <br /><br /> Drama unfolds case by case as the heroes of <i>The Poisoner's Handbook</i>—chief medical examiner Charles Norris and toxicologist Alexander Gettler—investigate a family mysteriously stricken bald, Barnum and Bailey's Famous Blue Man, factory workers with crumbling bones, a diner serving poisoned pies, and many others. Each case presents a deadly new puzzle and Norris and Gettler work with a creativity that rivals that of the most imaginative murderer, creating revolutionary experiments to tease out even the wiliest compounds from human tissue. Yet in the tricky game of toxins, even science can't always be trusted, as proven when one of Gettler's experiments erroneously sets free a suburban housewife later nicknamed ""America's Lucretia Borgia"" to continue her nefarious work. <br /><br /> From the vantage of Norris and Gettler's laboratory in the infamous Bellevue Hospital it becomes clear that killers aren't the only toxic threat to New Yorkers. Modern life has created a kind of poison playground, and danger lurks around every corner. Automobiles choke the city streets with carbon monoxide; potent compounds, such as morphine, can be found on store shelves in products ranging from pesticides to cosmetics. Prohibition incites a chemist's war between bootleggers and government chemists while in Gotham's crowded speakeasies each round of cocktails becomes a game of Russian roulette. Norris and Gettler triumph over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice during a remarkably deadly time.

The first complete account of the making of <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>, <em>Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.</em> reveals little-known facts about the cinema classic: Truman Capote desperately wanted Marilyn Monroe for the leading role; director Blake Edwards filmed multiple endings; Hepburn herself felt very conflicted about balancing the roles of mother and movie star. With a colorful cast of characters including Truman Capote, Edith Head, Givenchy, ""Moon River"" composer Henry Mancini, and, of course, Hepburn herself, Wasson immerses us in the America of the late fifties before Woodstock and birth control, when a not-so-virginal girl by the name of Holly Golightly raised eyebrows across the country, changing fashion, film, and sex for good. Indeed, cultural touchstones like <em>Sex and the City</em> owe a debt of gratitude to <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>.<br /><br />In this meticulously researched gem of a book, Wasson delivers us from the penthouses of the Upper East Side to the pools of Beverly Hills, presenting <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em> as we have never seen it before—through the eyes of those who made it.

It had been Inda's fate, as second son, to be his family's Shield Arm and spend his adult life protecting the lands his brother would one day inherit. <br /><br />But powerful factions in the royal court were committed to seeing Inda fail.

She can pack up her sensibility and take us with her to Paris, to Portugal (having picked it by spinning a globe and putting down her finger, and finally falling in with a group of Portuguese clowns), and even to Alaska, where the ""bear bells"" on her fellow bridesmaids' ponytails seemed silly until a grizzly cub dramatically intrudes. Meanwhile, back in New York, where new apartments beckon and taxi rides go awry, her sense of the city has become more layered, her relationships with friends and family more complicated.<br /><br />As always, Crosley's voice is fueled by the perfect witticism, buoyant optimism, flair for drama, and easy charm in the face of minor suffering or potential drudgery. But in <i>How Did You Get This Number</i> it has also become increasingly sophisticated, quicker and sharper to the point, more complex and lasting in the emotions it explores. And yet, Crosley remains the unfailingly hilarious young Every woman, healthily equipped with intelligence and poise to fend off any potential mundanity in maturity.",3.50,274,Hardcover, ,983,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7091863-how-did-you-get-this-number,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7091863-how-did-you-get-this-number

But he had his sights set on a lot more. He and his girl, Rosie Daly, were all set to run away to London together, get married, get good jobs, break away from factory work and poverty and their old lives.<br /><br />But on the winter night when they were supposed to leave, Rosie didn't show. Frank took it for granted that she'd given him the brush-off--probably because of his alcoholic father, nutcase mother, and generally dysfunctional family.

Then, twenty-two years later, Rosie's suitcase shows up behind a fireplace in a derelict house on Faithful Place, and Frank is going home whether he likes it or not.<br /><br />Getting sucked in is a lot easier than getting out again. Frank finds himself straight back in the dark tangle of relationships he left behind. The cops working the case want him out of the way, in case loyalty to his family and community makes him a liability.

Hezbollah, Hamas, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Taliban all began as religious groups dedicated to piety and charity. Yet once they turned to violence, they became horribly potent, executing campaigns of terrorism deadlier than those of their secular rivals. In <i>Radical, Religious, and Violent</i>, Eli Berman approaches the question using the economics of organizations. He first dispels some myths: radical religious terrorists are not generally motivated by the promise of rewards in the afterlife (including the infamous seventy-two virgins) or even by religious ideas in general. He argues that these terrorists (even suicide terrorists) are best understood as rational altruists seeking to help their own communities. Yet despite the vast pool of potential recruits -- young altruists who feel their communities are repressed or endangered -- there are less than a dozen highly lethal terrorist organizations in the world capable of sustained and coordinated violence that threatens governments and makes hundreds of millions of civilians hesitate before boarding an airplane. What's special about these organizations, and why are most of their followers religious radicals?<br /><br />Drawing on parallel research on radical religious Jews, Christians, and Muslims, Berman shows that the most lethal terrorist groups have a common characteristic: their leaders have found a way to control defection. Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Taliban, for example, built loyalty and cohesion by means of mutual aid, weeding out ""free riders"" and producing a cadre of members they could rely on. The secret of their deadly effectiveness lies in their resilience and cohesion when incentives to defect are strong.These insights suggest that provision of basic social services by competent governments adds a critical, nonviolent component to counterterrorism strategies. It undermines the violent potential of radical religious organizations without disturbing free religious practice, being drawn into theological debates with Jihadists, or endangering civilians.",3.90,300,Hardcover, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7097392-radical-religious-and-violent,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7097392-radical-religious-and-violent

Here is the story of two boys and the journey of a generation.<br /></b> <br />In December 2000, the Baltimore Sun<i> </i>ran a small piece about Wes Moore, a local student who had just received a Rhodes Scholarship.

One was named Wes Moore.  <br /><br />Wes just couldn’t shake off the unsettling coincidence, or the inkling that the two shared much more than space in the same newspaper. After following the story of the robbery, the manhunt, and the trial to its conclusion, he wrote a letter to the other Wes, now a convicted murderer serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. His letter tentatively asked the questions that had been haunting him: Who are you? How did this happen?<br /><br />That letter led to a correspondence and relationship that have lasted for several years. Over dozens of letters and prison visits, Wes discovered that the other Wes had had a life not unlike his own: Both had grown up in similar neighborhoods and had had difficult childhoods, both were fatherless; they’d hung out on similar corners with similar crews, and both had run into trouble with the police.

As, through our intimate relationship with them, we are exposed to our immaturity, they become our most accurate mirror of our own lack of emotional development. In other words, by inviting us to confront who we are in our relationship with them, our children raise us to be the parents they long for us to become.<br /><br />Despite our best intentions to raise our children well, in our unconsciousness we pass on emotional legacies to our children that have deep and lasting repercussions. Bequeathing to them our unresolved needs, unmet expectations, and frustrated dreams, we shackle them in unconscious patterns that shut them down to their own unique being. <br /><br />To do justice to parenthood, a parent needs to become conscious. Only to the degree we are willing to transform our own emotional present do we succeed in positively influencing our children’s future.<br /><br />Dr. Tsabary asks us to set aside traditional parenting strategies that major in controlling our children and instead find true kinship with their spirits by tuning into who each child is in its own unique essence. Surrendering to the oneness of the parent-child relationship in this way lifts parenting out of the physical and into the realm of the sacred.<br /><br />Peppered with practical, hands-on examples from Dr. Tsabary’s real-life experiences with the countless families she has helped journey consciously together, <i>A Call to Conscious Parenting</i> is a manual for giving our children the opportunity to shine and dazzle with their natural state of being.",4.28,300,Paperback, ,286,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7103545-the-conscious-parent,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7103545-the-conscious-parent

Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?<br /><br />People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers might have little in common, but they all <i>started with why</i>. It was their natural ability to start with why that enabled them to inspire those around them and to achieve remarkable things.<br /><br />In studying the leaders who've had the greatest influence in the world, Simon Sinek discovered that they all think, act, and communicate in the exact same way—and it's the complete opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be lead, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with WHY.<br /><br />Any organization can explain <i>what</i> it does; some can explain <i>how</i> they do it; but very few can clearly articulate <i>why</i>. WHY is not money or profit—those are always results. WHY does your organization exist? WHY does it do the things it does? WHY do customers really buy from one company or another? WHY are people loyal to some leaders, but not others?<br /><br />Starting with WHY works in big business and small business, in the nonprofit world and in politics. Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire. And the people who follow them don't do so because they have to; they follow because they want to.<br /><br />Drawing on a wide range of real-life stories, Sinek weaves together a clear vision of what it truly takes to lead and inspire.

The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years. <br /><br />The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience, and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries, setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his predecessors and peers, training their wits against an infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against cancer.” <br /><br />The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to Mukherjee’s own leukemia patient, Carla, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> is about the people who have soldiered through fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to increase our understanding of this iconic disease. <br /><br />Riveting, urgent, and surprising, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments.

This trend threatens America's competitive edge and the conduct of free markets everywhere. <br /><br /> An expert on the intersection of economics and politics, Ian Bremmer has followed the rise of state-owned firms in China, Russia, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Iran, Venezuela, and elsewhere.

In <i>Enlightened Sexism</i>, Susan J. Douglas, one of America's most entertaining and insightful cultural critics, takes readers on a spirited journey through the television programs, popular songs, movies, and news coverage of recent years, telling a story that is nothing less than the cultural biography of a new generation of American women.<br /><br />Revisiting cultural touchstones from <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> to <i>Survivor</i> to <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, Douglas uses wit and wisdom to expose these images of women as mere fantasies of female power, assuring women and girls that the battle for equality has been won, so there's nothing wrong with resurrecting sexist stereotypes—all in good fun, of course. She shows that these portrayals not only distract us from the real-world challenges facing women today but also drive a wedge between baby-boom women and their ""millennial"" daughters.<br /><br />In seeking to bridge this generation gap, Douglas makes the case for casting aside these retrograde messages, showing us how to decode the mixed messages that restrict the ambitions of women of all ages. And what makes <i>Enlightened Sexism</i> such a pleasure to read is Douglas's unique voice, as she blends humor with insight and offers an empathetic and sisterly guide to the images so many women love and hate with equal measure.",3.86,355,Hardcover, ,154,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7201148-enlightened-sexism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7201148-enlightened-sexism

On the same day that Roy Cady is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he senses that his boss, a dangerous loan-sharking bar-owner, wants him dead. Known “without affection” to members of the boss’s crew as “Big Country” on account of his long hair, beard, and cowboy boots, Roy is alert to the possibility that a routine assignment could be a deathtrap. Which it is. Yet what the would-be killers do to Roy Cady is not the same as what he does to them, which is to say that after a smoking spasm of violence, they are mostly dead and he is mostly alive.<br /><br />Before Roy makes his getaway, he realizes there are two women in the apartment, one of them still breathing, and he sees something in her frightened, defiant eyes that causes a fateful decision. He takes her with him as he goes on the run from New Orleans to Galveston, Texas—an action as ill-advised as it is inescapable. The girl’s name is Rocky, and she is too young, too tough, too sexy—and far too much trouble. Roy, Rocky, and her sister hide in the battered seascape of Galveston’s country-western bars and fleabag hotels, a world of treacherous drifters, pickup trucks, and ashed-out hopes. Any chance that they will find safety there is soon lost. Rocky is a girl with quite a story to tell, one that will pursue and damage Roy for a very long time to come in this powerful and atmospheric thriller, impossible to put down.

Decades later, Sylvie has remade herself as the ideal politician's wife-her hair dyed and straightened, her hippie-chick wardrobe replaced by tailored knit suits. At fifty-seven, she ruefully acknowledges that her job is staying twenty pounds thinner than she was in her twenties and tending to her husband, the senator. <br /><br />Lizzie, the Woodruffs' younger daughter, is at twenty-four a recovering addict, whose mantra HALT (Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired?) helps her keep her life under control. Still, trouble always seems to find her. Her older sister, Diana, an emergency room physician, has everything Lizzie failed to achieve-a husband, a young son, the perfect home-and yet she's trapped in a loveless marriage. With temptation waiting in one of the ER's exam rooms, she finds herself craving more. <br /><br />After Richard's extramarital affair makes headlines, the three women are drawn into the painful glare of the national spotlight. Once the press conference is over, each is forced to reconsider her life, who she is and who she is meant to be. <br /><br />Written with an irresistible blend of heartbreak and hilarity, Fly Away Home is an unforgettable story of a mother and two daughters who after a lifetime of distance finally learn to find refuge in one another.",3.69,401,Hardcover, ,2407,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7227174-fly-away-home,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7227174-fly-away-home

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<br /><br />It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<br /><br />One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<br /><br />Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<br /><br />Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<br /><br />The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<br /><br /><i>Speak again the ancient oaths:<br /><br />Life before death.<br />Strength before weakness.<br />Journey before Destination.<br /><br />and return to men the Shards they once bore.<br /><br />The Knights Radiant must stand again.</i>",4.62,1007,Hardcover, ,16203,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings

Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? <br /><br />To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth.",3.95,334,Hardcover, ,3758,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7237456-packing-for-mars,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7237456-packing-for-mars
