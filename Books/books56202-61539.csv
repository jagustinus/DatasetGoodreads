Drawing on in-depth observations of black and white middle-class, working-class, and poor families, <i>Unequal Childhoods </i>explores this fact, offering a picture of childhood today. Here are the frenetic families managing their children's hectic schedules of ""leisure"" activities; and here are families with plenty of time but little economic security. Lareau shows how middle-class parents, whether black or white, engage in a process of ""concerted cultivation"" designed to draw out children's talents and skills, while working-class and poor families rely on ""the accomplishment of natural growth,"" in which a child's development unfolds spontaneously—as long as basic comfort, food, and shelter are provided. Each of these approaches to childrearing brings its own benefits and its own drawbacks. In identifying and analyzing differences between the two, Lareau demonstrates the power, and limits, of social class in shaping the lives of America's children.<br /><br />The first edition of <i>Unequal Childhoods</i> was an instant classic, portraying in riveting detail the unexpected ways in which social class influences parenting in white and African-American families.

Instead, they are raised and taught to become experts in their weaknesses — and spend their lives trying to fix them — while their strengths lie dormant.<br /> <br /> Led by Don Clifton, the Father of Strengths-Based Psychology, Gallup created a revolutionary program to help people identify their talents; develop them into strengths; and enjoy consistent, near-perfect performance. Twenty years ago, Gallup released <i>Now, Discover Your Strengths </i>to bring this program to the world.<br /> <br /> At the heart of this book is CliftonStrengths, the assessment that is the product of decades of research and hundreds of thousands of interviews to identify the most prevalent human strengths. CliftonStrengths reveals 34 dominant talent themes that you can translate into personal and career success. To develop this assessment, Gallup conducted psychological profiles with more than 2 million individuals to help people around the world focus and perfect these themes. Since <i>Now, Discover Your Strengths</i> was first released two decades ago, more than 20 million people worldwide have taken the CliftonStrengths assessment.<br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary edition includes a unique access code to take CliftonStrengths — previously known as StrengthsFinder 2.0 — which is a significantly more robust program than the assessment that appeared in the original edition of the book.

Vividly bringing to life the latest scientific research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics, Gilbert reveals what scientists have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future, and about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there.

It's about doing all the things you swore you'd never do to get something you hadn't even been sure you wanted. It's about being a woman in a confusing, contradictory time. It's about testing the limits of a loving marriage. And it's about trying (and trying and trying) to have a baby. <br />Orenstein's story begins when she tells her new husband that she's not sure she ever wants to be a mother; it ends six years later after she's done almost everything humanly possible to achieve that goal, from ""fertility sex"" to escalating infertility treatments to New Age remedies to forays into international adoption. Her saga unfolds just as professional women are warned by the media to heed the ticking of their biological clocks, and just as fertility clinics have become a boom industry, with over two million women a year seeking them out.

The democratic ideals of the CPE have aroused the implacable hostility of Cardinal Richelieu, effective ruler of France, who has moved behind the scenes, making common cause with old enemies to stop this new threat to the privileged and powerful. But the CPE is also working in secret. A group of West Virginians have secretly traveled to Venice where their advanced medical knowledge may prevent the recurrence of the terrible plague which recently killed a third of the city-state's population. At the same time, the group hopes to establish commercial ties with Turkey's Ottoman Empire, then at the height of its power. And, most important, they hope to establish private diplomatic ties with the Vatican, exploiting Pope Urban VIII's misgivings about the actions of Richelieu and the Hapsburgs. But a Venetian artisan involved with the West Virginians may cause all their plans to come to naught. Having read 20th century history books of the period, he has become determined to rescue Galileo from his trial for heresy. The Americans are divided on whether to help him or stop him—and whether he succeeds or fails, the results may be catastrophic for the CPE.",3.69,675,Paperback, ,79,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57371.1634,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57371.1634

First published in Norway as two books in 1924 and 1925, the author collaborated with Minnesotan Lincoln Colcord on the English translation.<br /><br />The novel follows a Norwegian family's struggles as they try to make a new life as pioneers in the Dakota territory. Rølvaag is interested in psychology and the human cost of empire building, at a time when other writers focused on the glamor and romance of the West. The book reflects his personal experiences as a settler as well as the immigrant homesteader experience of his wife’s family. Both the grim realities of pioneering and the gloomy fatalism of the Norse mind are captured in depictions of snow storms, locusts, poverty, hunger, loneliness, homesickness, the difficulty of fitting into a new culture, and the estrangement of immigrant children who grow up in a new land.

It was the same piece and the same pianist, when broadcasting resumed six years later. <i>The Pianist</i> is Szpilman's account of the years inbetween, of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself, related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock. Szpilman, now 88, has not looked at his description since he wrote it in 1946 (the same time as Primo Levi's <i>If This Is A Man?</i>; it is too personally painful. The rest of us have no such excuse. <p> Szpilman's family were deported to Treblinka, where they were exterminated; he survived only because a music-loving policeman recognised him. This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto, growing thinner and hungrier, yet condemned to live. Ironically it was a German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, who saved Szpilman's life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him. Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp, but portions of his diary, reprinted here, tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed, thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality. Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in 1946, but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalin's Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews with the Nazis. In 1997 it was published in Germany after Szpilman's son found it on his father's bookcase. This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language. There were 3,500,000 Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation; after it there were 240,000. Wladyslaw Szpilman's extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives. --<i>David Vincent</i></p>",4.23,224,Paperback, ,13,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57770.The_Pianist,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57770.The_Pianist

Here he explains how, in its decision to invade Iraq, the Bush administration failed in its stewardship of American foreign policy. First, the administration wrongly made preventive war the central tenet of its foreign policy. In addition, it badly misjudged the global reaction to its exercise of “benevolent hegemony.” And finally, it failed to appreciate the difficulties involved in large-scale social engineering, grossly underestimating the difficulties involved in establishing a successful democratic government in Iraq.<br />Fukuyama explores the contention by the Bush administration’s critics that it had a neoconservative agenda that dictated its foreign policy during the president’s first term.  Providing a fascinating history of the varied strands of neoconservative thought since the 1930s, Fukuyama argues that the movement’s legacy is a complex one that can be  interpreted quite differently than it was after the end of the Cold War. Analyzing the Bush administration’s miscalculations in responding to the post–September 11 challenge, Fukuyama proposes a new approach to American foreign policy through which such mistakes might be turned around—one in which the positive aspects of the neoconservative legacy are joined with a more realistic view of the way American power can be used around the world.   ",3.53,264,Paperback, ,15,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57982.America_at_the_Crossroads,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57982.America_at_the_Crossroads

Ajax has broken the client-server barrier by decoupling the client from the server, but an Ajax application still needs a server to extract content from. The most effective use of Ajax and the server requires an understanding of REST, an architectural style used to define Web services.<br /><br /><i>Ajax Patterns and Best Practices</i> explores dynamic web applications that combine Ajax and REST as a single solution. A major advantage of REST is that, like Ajax, it can be used with today's existing technologies.<br /><br />This is an ideal book whether or not you have already created an Ajax application. Because the book outlines various patterns and best practices, you can quickly check and verify that you're building an efficient Ajax application.<br /><br />Inside the book, the patterns will answer the following questions:<br /><br />What is Ajax, and REST, and why do you even care? And if I should care what are some examples of websites that make effective use of Ajax and REST? What are the absolute basics of Ajax and REST and what parts of those basics should I use? How should deal with large amounts of data? Should I cache the data? Should I get the data piece fed to me? (Patterns: Cache Controller, and Infinite Data) People keep telling me that sessions and cookies are bad? Are they bad? What should I do? And while I think about how about generating content for other devices? (Permutations pattern) I want to fix the back-button problem of the HTML browser. (State Navigation pattern) What is the best way to create a mashup? (REST Based Model View Controller pattern) My page has so many links managed by JavaScript, and I am losing control, help me make this more organized! (Decoupled Navigation pattern) I understand that HTTP means I send data to the server, how about the server sending me some data without asking for it?

Every edition of the series has made the mastery of traditional calculus skills a priority, while embracing the best features of new technology and, when appropriate, calculus reform ideas. Now, the Eighth Edition is the first calculus program to offer algorithmic homework and testing created in Maple so that answers can be evaluated with complete mathematical accuracy.</p><p>Two primary objectives guided the authors in writing this book: to develop precise, readable materials for students that clearly define and demonstrate concepts and rules of calculus and to design comprehensive teaching resources for instructors that employ proven pedagogical techniques and saves the instructor time. The Eighth Edition continues to provide an evolving range of conceptual, technological, and creative tools that enable instructors to teach the way they want to teach and students to learn they way they learn best.</p> 
   The explanations, theorems, and definitions have been thoroughly and critically reviewed. Additionally, the exercise sets have been carefully and extensively examined to ensure they cover all calculus topics appropriately. 
   Questions involving skills, writing, critical thinking, problem-solving, applications, and real-data applications are included throughout the text. Exercises are presented in a variety of question formats, including matching, free response, true/false, modeling, and fill-in the blank.

Para que entendamos mejor sus argumentos sobre los grandes números y las probabilidades el autor recurre a divertidas y cotidianas anécdotas ilustrativas.

Written by UML's inventors (the so-called Three Amigos of software engineering), <i>The Unified Modeling Language User Guide</i> provides a very appealing guide to all the fundamentals of using UML effectively. The book opens with a basic tour of the essential concepts and modeling diagrams used in UML, including class diagrams, use case diagrams, and basic modeling principles. The authors pay close attention to modeling classes (and documenting the relationships between classes) as well as use case diagrams (which show how software will be used by various actors in a system). This book mixes in a little software-engineering theory, too, but it makes use of clear examples and actual UML diagrams to illustrate key concepts.<p> Later in the book, the authors discuss more difficult notational diagrams (such as state diagrams and activity diagrams, which can be used to model behavior in a system). Whatever your background in software engineering, you'll no doubt appreciate the author's clear explanations of basic (and advanced) modeling concepts, as well as the nuts-and-bolts details of today's powerful UML. With its combination of expert modeling advice and excellent detail on the specifics of UML, this book will be absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to use UML for real-world software design. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p>",3.55,0,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58118.El_Lenguaje_Unificado_de_Modelado,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58118.El_Lenguaje_Unificado_de_Modelado

You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.<br /> <br /> You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look ""in the wild"". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code.<br /> <br /> You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design pattern.<br /> <br /> Most importantly, you want to learn the ""secret language"" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.<br /> <br /> With <i>Head First Design Patterns</i>, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the ""Trading Spaces"" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.<br /> <br /> If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, <i>Head First Design Patterns</i> will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.",4.28,638,Paperback, ,382,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns

This book will get you way up to speed on the technology you'll know it so well, in fact, that you can pass the Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD) 1.4 exam.

You're over the legal limit for caffeine. You can't waste your time with a book that makes sense only AFTER you're an expert (or worse one that puts you to sleep).<br /><br /> No problem. <i>Head First Servlets and JSP's</i> brain-friendly approach drives the knowledge straight into your head (without sharp instruments). You'll interact with servlets and JSPs in ways that help you learn quickly and deeply. It may not be <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, but quickly see why so many reviewers call it ""a page turner"". Most importantly, this book will help you use what you learn. It won't get you through the exam only to have you forget everything the next day.<br /><br /> Learn to write servlets and JSPs, what makes the Container tick (and what ticks it off), how to use the new JSP Expression Language (EL), what you should NOT write in a JSP, how to write deployment descriptors, secure applications, and even use some server-side design patterns. Can't talk about Struts at a cocktail party? That'll change. You won't just pass the exam, you will truly understand this stuff, and you'll be able to put it to work right away.<br /><br /> This new exam is tough--much tougher than the previous version of the SCWCD. The authors of <i>Head First Servlets and JSP</i> know: they created it. (Not that it EVER occurred to them that if they made the exam really hard you'd have to buy a study guide to pass it.)

Both Java and XML are cross-platform technologies; by using Java for code and XML for transporting data, you can build truly portable applications. This title is aimed at intermediate to advanced programmers; while XML topics are explained more or less from scratch, readers will need prior knowledge of Java.<p> The book begins with an overview of XML and its uses, and goes on to explain how to parse XML by using the Simple API for XML (SAX 2). Next, there is coverage of how XML is validated by using Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and XML Schema, and transformed by using eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). Brief coverage of Sun's Java API for XML is followed by a detailed look at the Java Document Object Model (JDOM), a new API devised by the author in association with O'Reilly, the publisher. </p><p> The last part of the book is more advanced, and covers applications of XML and Java. There are chapters on Web-publishing frameworks, XML Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), using XML to read and write configuration data, and generating XML with Java. There is also a short business-to-business example. Appendices provide an API reference to the various specifications discussed in the book.</p><p> The strengths of <i>Java and XML</i> include the author's deep knowledge of his subject, and a writing style that is both clear and enthusiastic. If you happen to know a lot about Java and not much about XML, this is the ideal title.

Written by UML's inventors (the so-called Three Amigos of software engineering), <i>The Unified Modeling Language User Guide</i> provides a very appealing guide to all the fundamentals of using UML effectively. The book opens with a basic tour of the essential concepts and modeling diagrams used in UML, including class diagrams, use case diagrams, and basic modeling principles. The authors pay close attention to modeling classes (and documenting the relationships between classes) as well as use case diagrams (which show how software will be used by various actors in a system). This book mixes in a little software-engineering theory, too, but it makes use of clear examples and actual UML diagrams to illustrate key concepts.<p> Later in the book, the authors discuss more difficult notational diagrams (such as state diagrams and activity diagrams, which can be used to model behavior in a system). Whatever your background in software engineering, you'll no doubt appreciate the author's clear explanations of basic (and advanced) modeling concepts, as well as the nuts-and-bolts details of today's powerful UML. With its combination of expert modeling advice and excellent detail on the specifics of UML, this book will be absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to use UML for real-world software design. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p>",3.55,0,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58140.Lenguaje_Unificado_de_Modelado_El,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58140.Lenguaje_Unificado_de_Modelado_El

Lynch writes for the first time about his more than three-decade commitment to Transcendental Meditation and the difference it has made in his creative process.<br /><br />In brief chapters, Lynch explains the development of his ideas - where they came from, how he grasps them, and which ones appeal to him the most. He specifically discusses how he puts his thoughts into action and how he engages with others around him. Finally, he considers the self and the surrounding world - and how the process of ""diving within"" that has so deeply affected his own work can directly benefit others.<br /><br /><i>Catching the Big Fish</i> comes as a revelation to the legion of fans who have longed to better understand Lynch's personal vision.

Forced to remain silent about his rape by a convict code among inmates (one in which informers are murdered), Parsell's experience that first night haunted him throughout the rest of his sentence. In an effort to silence the guilt and pain of its victims, the issue of prisoner rape is a story that has not been told.

He gives voice to countless others who have been exposed to an incarceration system that turns a blind eye to the abuse of the prisoners in its charge.

Through this story of an ordinary man who unwittingly gets drawn into a senseless murder on a sun-drenched Algerian beach, Camus was exploring what he termed ""the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.""<br /><br />Now, in an illuminating new American translation (the only English version available for more than forty years was done by a British translator), the original intent of The Stranger is made more immediate, as Matthew Ward captures in exact and lucid language precisely what Camus said and how he said it, thus giving this haunting novel a new life for generations to come.<br /><br />Albert Camus, son of a working-class family, was born in Algeria in 1913. He spent the early years of his life in North Africa, where he worked at Various jobs -- in the weather bureau, in an automobile-accessory firm, in a shipping company -- to help pay for his courses at the University of Algiers. He then turned to journalism as a career. His report on the unhappy state of the Muslims of the Kabylie region aroused the Algerian government to action and brought him public notice. From 1935 to 1938 he ran the Theatre de L'Equipe, a theatrical company that produced plays by Malraux, Gide, Synge, Dostoevski, and others. During World War II he was one of the leading writers of the French Resistance and editor of Combat, then an important underground newspaper. Camus was always very active in the theater, and several of his plays have been published and produced. His fiction, including The Stranger, The Plague, The Fall, and Exile and the Kingdom; his philosophical essays, The Myth of Sisyphus and The Rebel; and his plays have assured his preeminent position in modern French letters. In 1957 Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. His sudden death on January 4, 1960, cut short the career of one of the most important literary figures of the Western world when he was at the very summit of his powers.",3.99,144,Hardcover, ,53,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58197.The_Stranger,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58197.The_Stranger

When her most famous story, <em>The Awakening</em>, was first published in 1899, it stunned readers with its frank portrayal of the inner word of Edna Pontellier, and its daring criticisms of the limits of marriage and motherhood. The subtle beauty of her writing was contrasted with her unwomanly and sordid subject-matter: Edna's rejection of her domestic role, and her passionate quest for spiritual, sexual, and artistic freedom. From her first stories, Chopin was interested in independent characters who challenged convention. This selection, freshly edited from the first printing of each text, enables readers to follow her unfolding career as she experimented with a broad range of writing, from tales for children to decadent <em>fin-de</em> <em>siecle</em> sketches. <em>The Awakening</em> is set alongside thirty-two short stories, illustrating the spectrum of the fiction from her first published stories to her 1898 secret masterpiece, ""The Storm.""<br /><br /><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work ""quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H. Lawrence in its treatment of infidelity.""

Tras una experiencia particularmente desagradable en casa de unos norteamericanos particularmente desagradables y una pelea con Eva, Wilt, bajo la inspiración de la ginebra, decide ensayar una de sus mas vengativas fantasías, en la que colabora una espectacular muñeca hinchable.

It is local history written with the eyes of an eagle, which is how it should be written but seldom is. It is a remarkable achievement.""--Winston James, Columbia University<br /><br />This engaging ethnography follows Cuban exiles from Jose Marti's revolution to the Jim Crow South in Tampa, Florida, as they shape an Afro-Cuban-American identity over a span of five generations.<br /><br />Unlike most studies of the Cuban exodus to the United States, which focus on the white, middle-class, conservative exiles from Castro's Cuba, <i>More Than Black</i> is peopled with Afro-Cubans of more modest means and more liberal ideology. Fifteen years of collaboration between the author and members of Tampa's century-old Marti-Maceo Society, a mutual-aid and Cuban independence group, yield a work that combines the intimacy of ethnography with the reach of oral and archival history. Its weave of rich historical and ethnographic materials re-creates and examines the developing community of black immigrants in Ybor City and West Tampa, the old cigar-making neighborhoods of the city. It is a story of unfolding consequences that begins when the black and white solidarity of emigrating Cubans comes up against Jim Crow racism and progresses through a painful renegotiation of allegiances and identities.<br /><br />Building on Marti's declaration that being Cuban was ""more than white, more than black,"" this study views, from the vantage of a community unique in time and place, the joint effects of ethnicity and gender in shaping racial identities. Photographs of individuals, families, and events, both historical and contemporary, complement the highly readable text.<br /><br />Susan D.

Among the gloriously vivid cast of characters he encounters are his tyrannical stepfather, Mr Murdstone; his brilliant, but ultimately unworthy school-friend James Steerforth; his formidable aunt, Betsey Trotwood; the eternally humble, yet treacherous Uriah Heep; frivolous, enchanting Dora Spenlow; and the magnificently impecunious Wilkins Micawber, one of literature's great comic creations. In David Copperfield - the novel he described as his 'favourite child' - Dickens drew revealingly on his own experiences to create one of the most exuberant and enduringly popular works, filled with tragedy and comedy in equal measure. This edition uses the text of the first volume publication of 1850, and includes updated suggestions for further reading, original illustrations by 'Phiz', a revised chronology and expanded notes.

She's been married to her beloved Jack for nearly twenty years, raised one child and buried another, and run a business that binds her community together, all while holding her tight circle of family and friends close. <br />But with her daughter, Etta, having flown the nest to enchanting Italy, Ave Maria has reached a turning point.

In this fourth entry, Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney and her husband, Jack, must come to terms with the absence of daughter Etta, newly married and living in Italy. (The country holds a special place in Ave Maria's heart: her biological father, Mario, whom she learned of and met only after her mother's death, is Italian). Ave Maria has plenty to keep her mind off missing her only child (the MacChesney's son, Joe, died of leukemia at age four). She's a full-time pharmacist and the newly appointed director of the town's annual musical. Then comes news that her longtime friend, glamorous librarian Iva Lou, has been keeping a startling secret for nearly 20 years. Other developments, including a health scare for Jack and a Christmas visit from a colorful former resident, move the plot along briskly. With her original cast of characters, playwright and television writer Trigiani blends playfulness and pathos in this evocative portrait of a small southern town. Fans of the Big Stone Gap series can look forward to a feature film; Trigiani has written the screenplay and is slated to direct. -""Allison Block<br />""""Is there ever trouble for Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, heroine of Trigiani's beloved Big Stone Gap novels, starting with her married daughter's move to Italy and leading right up to a stranger's disturbing appearance in town.""-""Library Journal"" <br />Praise for the Big Stone Gap novels: <br />""Delightfully quirky . . . chock-full of engaging, oddball characters and unexpected plot twists.""<br />-""People"" (Book of the Week) <br />""Funny, charming, and original.""<br />-Fannie Flagg <br />""Satisfying reading . . .

With her new status in the elite meritocracy that is the federal judiciary, she often feels like an imposter because of her working-class background. For instance, at a fancy dinner, she’s more likely to joke with the waiters than her colleagues. Divorced, Cate also has a secret sex life. She’s attracted to bad boys and working-class men, like the ones she grew up with in the former coal-mining town of Centralia in northeastern Pennsylvania.<br /><br />Cate is presiding over a high-profile multi-million dollar breach-of-contract lawsuit in which a former Philly ADA is suing the producer of a highly successful TV series for stealing his ideas. All true, but the verbal contract isn’t enforceable. As difficult as it is, this means that Cate has to make a ruling that ends the lawsuit in the sleazy TV guy’s favor. Cate learns that being a judge doesn’t always mean that she can do justice.<br /><br />Upset over the ruling she had to make, Cate heads for a bar and there meets a good-looking rough-hewn leather-jacketed hunk and goes off with him to a nearby motel. Cate quickly realizes she’s made a mistake, apologizes and turns to leave, but the guy becomes aggressive and Cate barely manages to get out of the room. At home, she turns on the local news to learn that the TV producer from her court case has been shot to death outside a local restaurant.

A specialist in geriatric medicine, Purcell was a prominent member of the Santa Theresa medical community, and the police had done a thorough job. Purcell had no known enemies and seemed content with his life. At the time of his disappearance, he was running a nursing care facility where both the staff and the patients loved him. He adored his second wife, Crystal, and doted on their two-year-old son. <br />It wasn't Crystal who called Kinsey. It was Purcell's ex-wife, Fiona. Everything about their meeting made Kinsey uneasy. Fiona's manner was high-handed and her expectations unrealistic. Kinsey's instincts told her to refuse the job, yet she ended up saying, ""I'll do what I can, but I make no promises."" <br />It was a decision she'd live to regret. <br />Pursuing the mysterious disappearance of Purcell, Kinsey crashes into a wall of speculation. It seems everyone has a theory. The cops think he went on a bender and is too ashamed to come home. Fiona is sure he ran off to get away from Crystal, and Crystal is just as sure he's dead. The staff at the nursing home is convinced he's been kidnapped, and one of his daughters, having consulted a psychic, is certain that he's trapped in a dark place, though she doesn't know where. Kinsey is awash in explanations and sorely lacking in facts. Then pure chance leads her in another direction, and she soon finds herself in a dangerous shadow land, where duplicity and double-dealing arethe reality and, with the truth glinting elusively out of reach, she must stake her life on a thin thread of intuition. <br />P Is for Peril Kinsey Millhone's latest venture into the darker side of the human soul.",3.87,0,Audiobook, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58904.P_is_for_Peril,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58904.P_is_for_Peril

Long before Diego became famous for his Mexican murals or was applauded for his renowned wife, Frida Kahlo, he was married to Beloff. She was his wife for over ten years while the young Rivera lived as a poor and obscure artist in the city of light. Wolfe was impressed by the letters Beloff wrote to her husband after his definitive departure for Mexico and included a chapter on them and the Russian painter in his biography of the muralist. Several years later, Mexican author Elena Poniatowska read Wolfe's biography and, deeply impressed by Angelina Beloff's letters, decided to rewrite them. The result is Querido Diego, te abraza Quiela, a masterful blending of fact and fiction that creates a novella out of twelve imagined letters that Quiela (Angelina) writes to Diego over a nine-month period. Within them, we are able to view the artist's world of post-war Paris where Quiela struggles forward without her husband while falling back onto fond memories of their time spent together while also suffering the torment of the darker moments she lived with the painter. It offers the reader a beautiful portrait of life and art in an iconic city towards the beginning of the 20th century. This brief work exhibits some of the fundamental traits encountered in Poniatowska's narratives: a focus on strong women, an interest in the real and the marginal, and a love for Mexico. While translations of this narrative do exist in various languages, Nathanial Gardner's bilingual edition is a new initiative that introduces the reader to the work of one of Mexico's most celebrated female writers and helps the student and enthusiast understand this author's place and importance in Latin American letters.<p></p>",3.71,86,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59204.Dear_Diego,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59204.Dear_Diego

What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig’s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged.

By turns a tragedy and a farce, an acidic black comedy and an indictment of modern politics, The Eagle’s Throne is a seriously entertaining and perceptive story of international intrigue, sexual deception, naked ambition, and treacherous betrayal.<br />In the near future, at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, Mexico’s idealistic president has dared to vote against the U.S. occupation of Colombia and Washington’s refusal to pay OPEC prices for oil. Retaliation is swift.

As the blizzard of activity grows more and more complex, political adversaries come out to prey. The ineffectual president, his scheming cabinet secretary, a thuggish and ruthless police chief, and an unscrupulous, sensual kingmaker are just a few of the fascinating characters maneuvering and jockeying for position to achieve the power they all so desperately crave.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.88,352,Paperback, ,49,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59412.The_Eagle_s_Throne,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59412.The_Eagle_s_Throne

In prose of often dreamlike coloration and intensity, Alejo Carpentier records the destruction of the black regime—built on the same corruption and contempt for human life that brought down French rule while embodying its same hollow grandeur of false elegance attained only through slave labor—in an orgy of voodoo, race hatred, madness, and erotomania.",3.78,180,Paperback, ,37,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59496.The_Kingdom_of_This_World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59496.The_Kingdom_of_This_World

From the rituals of sunrise at Persepolis to the incongruity of Louis Armstrong performing before a stone-faced crowd in Khartoum, Kapuscinski gives us the non-Western world as he first saw it, through still-virginal Western eyes.<br /><br />The companion on his travels: a volume of Herodotus, a gift from his first boss. Whether in China, Poland, Iran, or the Congo, it was the “father of history”—and, as Kapuscinski would realize, of globalism—who helped the young correspondent to make sense of events, to find the story where it did not obviously exist. It is this great forerunner’s spirit—both supremely worldly and innately Occidental—that would continue to whet Kapuscinski’s ravenous appetite for discovering the broader world and that has made him our own indispensable companion on any leg of that perpetual journey.",4.06,288,Hardcover, ,311,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59664.Travels_with_Herodotus,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59664.Travels_with_Herodotus

This for a writer who, to echo the sentiments of Michael Ignatieff, has turned reportage into literature. Drawn to the Developing World through an impoverished wartime upbringing, Kapuscinski arrived in Ghana in 1957 and was on hand to witness the tumultuous years in which colonial Africa was dismantled, resulting in born-again countries ripe for ransacking by despots. From the glare of Accra airport which greets him on first arrival, to the Tanzanian night of the final pages, he crosses savannah, desert and city by foot, road and train, searching out the two most important, yet inconstant commodities on the continent: shade and water. Threatened by an Egyptian cobra, cursed with cerebral malaria and tuberculosis, plagued by black cockroaches the size of small turtles, Kapuscinski intermingles the immediate and the reflective in 29 satisfyingly fragmented vignettes, encompassing historical narratives and personal experience across a host of countries, including Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Sudan and Liberia.<p> While acknowledging European colonial culpability, he refuses to rinse his words in guilt. <i>The Shadow of the Sun</i> is reminiscent of Gianni Celati's <i>Adventures in Africa</i>, employing similarly symphonic atmospherics that can bear poetic witness to both the tragic history of Rwanda and the Ngubi beetle, which toils in the desert to produce the sweat it drinks to survive. As much about the plastic water container as the warlord and preferring the African shanty town to the Manhattan skyscraper as a monument to human achievement, what Kapuscinski, the author of <i>Shah of Shahs</i> describes is not Africa, which he claims does not exist except geographically but a distillation of life itself, through its religiosity, its trees, the frightening abundance of youth, sun that ""curdles the blood"" and terrorising, ruling armies that fall in a day. The first in a projected trilogy pulling together Africa, Central America and Asia, <i>The Shadow of the Sun</i> is an exceptional and humbling work of imagination and experience by a writer intent on liberating truths from fact. --<i>David Vincent</i></p>",4.38,325,Paperback, ,60,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59668.The_Shadow_of_the_Sun,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59668.The_Shadow_of_the_Sun

Aisladas en sus casas y sometidas a la férrea autoridad masculina, el nu shu era su única vía de escape.

She calls this new fiction actualism, and within that framework she offers a critical analysis of major novels by Thomas Pynchon, Robert Coover, William Gaddis, John Barth, Margaret Atwood, and Donald Barthelme. <br /><br />According to Strehle, the actualists balance attention to questions of art with an engaged meditation on the external, actual world. While these actualist novels diverge markedly from realistic practice, Strehle claims that they do so in order to reflect more acutely what we now understand as real. Reality is no longer realistic; in the new physical or quantum universe, reality is discontinuous, energetic, relative, statistical, subjectively seen, and uncertainly known -- all terms taken from new physics.<br /><br />Actualist fiction is characterized by incompletions, indeterminacy, and open endings unsatisfying to the readerly wish for fulfilled promises and completed patterns. <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>, for example, ends not with a period but with a dash.

Elizabeth Mapp-Flint, in yet another bid to wrest power back from her social rival Lucia Pillson-now the town's mayor-purchases a motor-car. Hoping to improve her shaky motoring skills in private, she makes a significant tactical error by leaving town. Lucia profits from Elizabeth's absence by putting one of her ""ideas"" into action: the embroidery of a tapestry depicting the history of Tilling, one that will surely surpass Bayeux's. All Lucia's subjects are called upon to labour long and hard in its execution. Meanwhile Elizabeth, stranded in Southampton, happens upon a game of Monopoly in her hotel room, and-minus her broken-winged chariot-hurries home to rescue her fellow Tillingites from the tedium of Lucia's latest worthy endeavor. Who will prove the greater master of Monopoly? What will become of the abandoned tapestry? Is Elizabeth really descended from Norman nobility? Is Mallards haunted, and if so, who saw the ghost first-Lucia, its current resident, or Elizabeth, its former owner?

And he does all of it in his inimitable voice and through his cartoon stand–in narrator, mixing dry humor and legitimate instruction.

An unusual lesson indeed for a respectable woman of the court, but Blanchard is no ordinary lady in waiting. She does have the proper antecedents for her place, but an eye and an ear for suspicious dealings helps her to earn additional income. She is a spy, paid to seek out traitorous deeds. In <i>The Doublet Affair</i>, Lord Burleigh sends her to watch some erstwhile friends whose dealings have become more suspicious than keeping the odd Catholic priest under their roof. The plot is enriched by Ursula's own ambivalence about her role: not only does she have a fondness for the family under suspicion, she longs to leave court entirely to join her French husband. <p> The central mystery is an appropriate one for the period. There are the usual mysterious deaths as well as hints of treachery against the crown. Indeed, one of Fiona Buckley's strengths is her historical appreciation for the fact that Elizabeth, despite her longevity, was never completely secure on the throne; Catholic plots and other schemes of usurpation abounded. Buckley's weakness is her certainty (and Ursula's) that Elizabeth was gentler in religious persecution than her sister. Regardless, Buckley's imaginative sense of quotidian life in Elizabethan England is delightful, and the mystery reaches a satisfying conclusion--with Ursula's lock picks put to good use. </p><p> Fiona Buckley is a pseudonym for an established author venturing into historical whodunits. <i>The Doublet Affair</i> follows her first effort, <i>To Shield the Queen</i>. <i>--K.

Ursula Blanchard, illegitimate half sister to Queen Elizabeth I and sometime spy on the Queen's behalf, is happily married to wealthy Hugh Stannard and living quietly in the country. Ursula's thoughts are on domestic matters as she watches her daughter, Meg, grow up. Meg will soon be fourteen, so perhaps it is time to think of a betrothal. <br /> When an invitation to visit arrives from the powerful Duke of Norfolk, Ursula and Hugh welcome the chance for Meg to meet an apparently worthy young man of the Duke's household, Edmund Dean. Is he a possible husband for Meg? <br /> It's love at first sight, at least on Meg's part. Young Dean seems to admire Meg as well, and he's even more impressed with her promised dowry. Ursula, though, has her doubts. Does she see something cruel in the man's eyes? <br /> Soon, more weighty matters demand Ursula's attention. Two men are dead under mysterious circumstances, and there may be a new plot to put Mary, Queen of Scots, on the English throne. A letter written in cipher may contain the information Ursula needs -- but can she decode the letter in time to save the half sister and Queen she loves? And what shattering personal discovery will the letter reveal? <br /> Surrounded by treachery, Ursula wonders whom she can trust. Is the great Duke of Norfolk himself part of the plot against Queen Elizabeth? And what about the young man who would marry Meg? <br /> With richly drawn characters and riveting historical accuracy, <i>The Siren Queen</i> sweeps us into a suspenseful and passionate re-creation of one of the most tumultuous and colorful eras of English history.",3.87,288,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60267.The_Siren_Queen,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60267.The_Siren_Queen

En la novela, el medio geográfico y social parece determinar de modo decisivo el ser y el existir de sus criaturas; el destino parece jugar con esos personajes, pobres lugareños aferrados al terruño, vivos y elementales, que defienden rabiosamente su libertad y constituyen un retablo de cruda y palpitante humanidad. Entre ellos surge poderosamente la figura del Ratero, y sobre todo la del Nini, niño que vive sufriendo e intenta rebelarse contra la sordidez que le rodea; pero su rebeldía es callada, dulce, sin vanidad, y le levanta a la altura de símbolo: el bien contra el mal, el candor contra la astucia... El drama sera inevitable, pero la tragedia —ha dicho un crítico— «está contada de la manera sencilla con que las tragedias se abaten sobre el hombre en la vida: sin demasía, sin melodrama, sin aspavientos».</p><p>Miguel Delibes nació en Valladolid en 1920.

When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare.

In a period of almost continuous upheaval, society was transformed by two world wars, the Russian Revolution, the Holocaust, and the rise and fall of the Third Reich. Combining a powerful narrative with profound analysis, acclaimed historian Robert Gellately argues that these tragedies are inextricably linked and that to consider them as discrete events is to misunderstand their genesis and character. Central to the catastrophe, of course, were Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler, and this book makes use of recently opened Russian and German sources to explain how these dictatorsâ�� pursuit of utopianâ��and dreadfully flawedâ��ideals led only to dystopian nightmare. <br /><br />In a groundbreaking work, Gellately makes clear that most comparative studies of the Soviet and Nazi dictatorships are undermined by neglecting the key importance of Lenin in the unfolding drama. Rejecting the myth of the â��goodâ�� Lenin, the book provides a convincing social-historical account of all three dictatorships and carefully documents their similarities and differences. It traces the escalation of conflicts between Communism and Nazism, and particularly of the role of Hitlerâ��s anathema against what he called â��Jewish Bolshevism.â�� The book shows how the vicious rivalry between Stalin and Hitler led inescapably to a war of annihilation and genocide.

Now it is time for Lilith to lead them back to her home world, but life among the Oankali on the newly resettled planet will be nothing like it was before.<br /><br />The Oankali survive by genetically merging with primitive civilizations—whether their new hosts like it or not. For the first time since the nuclear holocaust, Earth will be inhabited. Grass will grow, animals will run, and people will learn to survive the planet’s untamed wilderness. But their children will not be human. Not exactly.",4.13,248,Paperback, ,2431,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60929.Dawn,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60929.Dawn

Severely traumatized by this experience, she spends the rest of her life battling madness, trying desperately through psychotherapy - she is treated by disciples of both Freud and C.G. Jung, and even by Jung himself - to regain the ability to recognize her own reality and to feel. It is only with the help of the most unlikely ally she can imagine that she begins to study the mythological ""reasons"" invented by her ancient ancestors for what was done to her and to millions of other women and girls over thousands of years. As her understanding grows, so does her capacity to encounter her overwhelming grief. Underneath this grief is her glowing anger. Anger propels her to act.

While the business was achieving unprecedented success, the family found itself shrouded in personal tragedy.<br /><br />In 1993, Gucci's financial partner, InvestCorp, forced Maurizio Gucci, the last of the Gucci family to run the Gucci Corporation, out for draining company coffers with extravagant business practices. However, on March 27, 1995, the Gucci heir was slain as he approached his office building. In 1998, his ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli was sentenced to 29 years in prison, for arranging his murder. <br /><br />Did Patrizia murder her ex-husband because his spending was wildly out of control?

But in 1970, everything changed. Her growing dissatisfaction with domestic life, and a blossoming awareness of the social inequities in Nicaragua, led her to join the Sandinistas, then a burgeoning but still hidden organization. She would be involved with them over the next twenty years at the highest, and often most dangerous, levels.<br /><br />Her memoir is both a revelatory insider's account of the Revolution and a vivid, intensely felt story about coming of age under extraordinary circumstances. Belli writes with both striking lyricism and candor about her personal and political lives: about her family, her children, the men in her life; about her poetry; about the dichotomies between her birth-right and the life she chose for herself; about the failures and triumphs of the Revolution; about her current life, divided between California (with her American husband and their children) and Nicaragua; and about her sustained and sustaining passion for her country and its people.",4.20,380,Paperback, ,159,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61030.The_Country_Under_My_Skin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61030.The_Country_Under_My_Skin

This riveting, behind-the-scenes exposé unfolded like a cinematic blockbuster told through the eyes of a man who once helped shape that empire. Now, in <i>The Secret History of the American Empire</i>, Perkins zeroes in on hot spots around the world and, drawing on interviews with other hit men, jackals, reporters, and activists, examines the current geopolitical crisis. Instability is the norm: It’s clear that the world we’ve created is dangerous and no longer sustainable. How did we get here? Who’s responsible? What good have we done and at what cost? And what can we do to change things for the next generations? Addressing these questions and more, Perkins reveals the secret history behind the events that have created the American Empire, including:<br /><br /> • The current Latin-American revolution and its lessons for democracy <br /> • How the “defeats” in Vietnam and Iraq benefited big business<br /> • The role of Israel as “Fortress America” in the Middle East<br /> • Tragic repercussions of the IMF’s “Asian Economic Collapse”<br /> • U.S. blunders in Tibet, Congo, Lebanon, and Venezuela <br /> • Jackal (CIA operatives) forays to assassinate democratic presidents<br /><br /> From the U.S. military in Iraq to infrastructure development in Indonesia, from Peace Corps volunteers in Africa to jackals in Venezuela, Perkins exposes a conspiracy of corruption that has fueled instability and anti-Americanism around the globe.

Inútil señalar al lector el estupor de esta familia cuando descubrió que Ribeyro no sólo prefería los estudios universitarios de Letras a los más honrosos de Derecho, sino que, además, empezaba a escribir cuentos, tenía el descaro de querer ser escritor y de juntarse con otros réprobos como él. Y, como buen “réprobo”, entró en el círculo mágico de aquellos que publican sus primeros escritos en ediciones cuya tirada ridícula casi toda se regala y que a la casa paterna prefieren el bar. Del mundo literario limeño, en el que empezaba a ser “alguien”, y quizá como temiéndolo, se marchó a Europa en 1952 donde vivió en España, Francia, Alemania y Bélgica. En 1960, se establece en París como periodista en la Agencia France-Presse hasta 1971, año en que entra a trabajar como Consejero Cultural del Perú en la Unesco. Desde el bohemio hasta el hombre casado y padre de familia, todo, casi todo, en la vida de Julio Ramón Ribeyro ha ocurrido como tratando de destruir al escritor que hay en él y nada, sin embargo, ha logrado destruirlo: su silenciosa terquedad creador ha alcanzado, absurdamente, el fruto que le estaba estrictamente prohibido, la Obra. Lentamente, casi a pesar suyo, ésta ha ido cobrando volumen, peso. Hoy, sus cuentos están reunidos, en Perú, en tres extensos volúmenes de los cuales se publicó, en España, una selección con el título de Juventud en la otra ribera (Argos Vergara, 1982); dos de sus tres novelas, Crónica de San Gabriel y Los geniecillos dominicales, están publicadas por Tusquets en su colección “Andanzas”; y estas Prosas apátridas, que aparecieron en esta colección en 1975, vuelven a la luz, aumentadas y, al parecer del autor, finalmente completas, con 111 prosas más. ¿Qué son estas Prosas apátridas? ¿Son apuntes sueltos, páginas de un diario íntimo, una filosofía de bolsillo? Posiblemente son todo eso y más; pero sobre todo son un autorretrato espiritual, la esencia que una experiencia literaria filtra de su fidelidad a la vida. Varios motivos centrales evitan la dispersión de la miscelánea. Estos motivos son: la literatura, el sexo, los hijos y la vida doméstica, la vejez y la muerte, la historia, la calle como espectáculo y la ventana como observatorio de la existencia.",4.27,144,Paperback, ,25,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61477.Prosas_ap_tridas,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61477.Prosas_ap_tridas

Toward the end of his long life, Gombrich embarked upon a revision and, at last, an English translation. <i>A Little History of the World</i> presents his lively and involving history to English-language readers for the first time. Superbly designed and freshly illustrated, this is a book to be savored and collected. In forty concise chapters, Gombrich tells the story of man from the stone age to the atomic bomb. In between emerges a colorful picture of wars and conquests, grand works of art, and the spread and limitations of science.

It seeks to answer a simple question: why is there such a thing as style? The question may be simple but there is no easy answer, and Professor Gombrich's brilliant and wide-ranging exploration of the history and psychology of pictorial representation leads him into countless crucial areas. Gombrich examines, questions and re-evaluates old and new ideas on such matters as the imitation of nature, the function of tradition, the problem of abstraction, the validity of perspective and the interpretation of expression: all of which reveal that pictorial representation is far from being a straightforward matter. First published more than 40 years ago, Art and Illusion has lost none of its vitality and importance. In applying the findings of experimental science to a nuanced understanding of art and in tackling complex ideas and theoretical issues, Gombrich is rigorous.<br /><br />Yet he always retains a sense of wonder at the inexhaustible capacity of the human brain, and at the subtlety of the relationships involved in seeing the world and in making and seeing art. With profound knowledge and his exceptional gift for clear exposition, he advances each argument as an hypothesis to be tested. The problems of representation are forever fundamental to the history of art: Art and Illusion remains an essential text for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of art. For the sixth edition Professor Gombrich has written an entirely new 12-page preface, in which he makes use of the distinction between an image and a sign, so as to clarify his intentions in writing the book in the first place.",4.02,412,Paperback, ,36,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61506.Art_and_Illusion,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61506.Art_and_Illusion
