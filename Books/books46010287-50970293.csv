His mother conceived him out of wedlock, and at age 13, in Charleston, South Carolina, he was sent to work to support her and his siblings. But, via the assistance of series of mentors, he rose from obscurity, making his way to Washington, before joining the upper echelons of society by marrying the daughter of an influential senator, Thomas Hart Benton, who only reluctantly blessed their union. Jessie Benton Frémont, as she came to be known, had grown up in the mold of her father, knowing personally then President Andrew Jackson, but her ambition was frustrated. She had limited options for own career advancement, at a time when women could not yet vote let alone hold public office. But she threw herself passionately into the promotion of her husband who rose to become one of the most famous men of the era. John travelled thousands of miles on horseback, at times with an almost willful indifference to his safety and that of the other members of his expeditions, many of whom would perish, in an effort to map the uncharted American West. The notes and letters he would send home Jessie skillfully shaped into dramatic reports and bestselling books. She became his political adviser, and was gradually recognized as a political force in her own right. Thus she helped lift John to a seat in the Senate, and ultimately to propel him, in 1856, to become the first-ever presidential nominee of the newly established Republican party. <br /><br />With rare detail and in consummate style, Inskeep tells this story of a couple whose joint ambitions and talents seemed somehow intertwined with those of the nascent United States itself. The Frémonts came to be influential to not one but three great social movements of the times--westward settlement, women's rights and opposition to slavery. Their adventures amount to nothing less than a tour of the early American soul.",3.85,480,Hardcover, ,126,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46033572-imperfect-union,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46033572-imperfect-union

But despite his modesty, one thing even he agreed with was that he was a born raconteur—as he makes clear in this collection of sparkling conversations. His wit, passion, and deep intelligence shine through all manner of discussion here, from heart-to-hearts with bloggers, to on-stage talks before massive crowds, to intense interviews with major television programs. Without fail, Bourdain is always blisteringly honest—such as when he talks about his battles with addiction, or when detailing his thoughts on restaurant critics. He regularly dispenses arresting insight about how what’s on your plate reveals much of history and politics.

When General Franco and his Fascists succeed in overthrowing the government, hundreds of thousands are forced to flee in a treacherous journey over the mountains to the French border.

  <b>‘INDIA IS AN IMPROBABLE NATION.’</b>
</p><p>Under Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party, India has undergone the most total transformation since 1991. The ‘invisible threads’ Nehru said held together an improbable union divided by language, religion and ethnicity have snapped under the burden of Modi’s Hindu-supremacist rule.</p><p>In this blistering critique of post-Independence India from Nehru to Modi, K.S. Komireddi charts the unsound course of Indian nationalism: its cowardly concessions to the Hindu right, convenient distortions of India’s past and demeaning bribes to India’s minorities. He argues that the missteps of the nation’s founders, the mistakes of Nehru, the betrayals of his daughter and her sons, the anti-democratic fetish for technocracy inaugurated by Narasimha Rao and carried to the extremes by Manmohan Singh—all of them laid down the road on which Hindu nationalists rode to absolute power.</p><p>Hindu bigotry, ennobled under Modi as a healthy form of self-assertion, has reopened old fissures that threaten to devour India’s hard-won unity. Yet bad times have also smashed the citizenly complacency that brought India to this point. There are multitudes who now realise how extraordinary and brave the idea of India was to begin with; there is a resurgent struggle against its extinction, and the assertion of new voices to wrest the republic from the forces of religious majoritarianism.</p><p>A short history of the modern Indian nation, <i>Malevolent Republic</i> is also an impassioned plea for India’s reclamation.</p><p> ‘Kapil Komireddi is one of the most thoughtful and thorough journalists writing today. His range of interests is impressive in its breadth and cosmopolitanism; his is a rare voice that can comment on global affairs from a truly comparative perspective.’ </p><p>AMITAV Ghosh</p><p> ‘Kapil Komireddi is a write of flair, originality and, above all, an absolute independence of mind … His ability to see through posturing and prejudice makes his work both distinctive and compelling. This book deserves to be widely read within India and beyond.’</p><p>RAMACHANDRA GUHA</p>",4.21,242,Kindle Edition, ,75,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46047632-malevolent-republic,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46047632-malevolent-republic

He reveals how the Arab Legion was transformed, by Cold War concerns, from an internal Jordanian security force to a quasi-division within the British Army.

Se trataba de superar la tradición monárquica de mantener el orden para hacer realidad la ambición revolucionaria de transformar el país: la Administración pública fue el instrumento ideado para que la acción de gobierno llegara hasta los últimos rincones del territorio, impulsando el progreso en las más diversas actividades de una sociedad que se concebía como ""nación"". <br /><br />Construir el Estado requirió de un largo esfuerzo de reflexión doctrinal, creación de instituciones, reclutamiento de soldados y funcionarios, construcción de oficinas y cuarteles, recaudación de impuestos, organización, difusión de símbolos, y despliegue por el territorio. <br /><br />Sin duda, la materialización del Estado, que se extiende a lo largo de todo el siglo XIX, fue un proceso complicado, conflictivo y discontinuo, con varios proyectos en pugna y con referentes internacionales diversos. Pero, si se mira con perspectiva histórica, la construcción del Estado español contemporáneo aparece como un caso temprano y relativamente exitoso. La proximidad de Francia y la drástica reducción del imperio colonial en los inicios del siglo fueron dos retos decisivos para impulsar la formación y consolidación de un Estado-nación que se encuentra entre los más estables de Europa.<br /><br />La construcción del Estado fue un proyecto de tal envergadura que involucró a todos los sectores de la sociedad española, transformando las estructuras económicas, las identidades, los marcos culturales y los alineamientos políticos. Frente a la insistencia convencional de los historiadores en hablar de la nación y los nacionalismos, una mirada al sustrato material y político de todo ello, que fue el Estado, nos muestra otra imagen del legado que nos dejó el siglo XIX; y ofrece la posibilidad de una lectura diferente de la Historia contemporánea de España.",4.00,768,Kindle Edition, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46156864-la-construcci-n-del-estado-en-espa-a,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46156864-la-construcci-n-del-estado-en-espa-a

It is that brilliant, that intense, and one of the finest explorations I know of what it means to be a woman and an artist.”</strong><strong>—Sigrid Nunez, author of <em>The Friend</em> and Winner of the National Book Award for Fiction</strong><br /><br /><strong>In this bold and brilliant memoir, the acclaimed author of the novel <em>Museum Pieces</em> and the collection <em>Mendocino Fire</em> explores the ferocious desire for perfection which has shaped her writing life as well as her rich, dramatic, and constantly surprising personal life</strong>.<br /><br /><br />In the decade between age twenty-seven and thirty-seven, Elizabeth Tallent published five literary books with Knopf, her short stories appeared in <em>The New Yorker, </em>and she secured a coveted teaching job at Stanford University. But this extraordinary start to her career was followed by twenty-two years of silence. She wrote —or rather published— nothing at all. Why? <em>Scratched</em> is the remarkable response to that question.<br /><br />Elizabeth’s story begins in a hospital in mid-1950s suburban Washington, D.C., when her mother refuses to hold her newborn daughter, shocking behavior that baffles the nurses. Imagining her mother’s perfectionist ideal at this critical moment, Elizabeth moves back and forth in time, juxtaposing moments in the past with the present in this innovative and spellbinding narrative.<br /><br />She traces her journey from her early years in which she perceived herself as “the child whose flaws let disaster into an otherwise perfect family,” to her adulthood, when perfectionism came to affect everything. As she toggles between teaching at Stanford in Palo Alto and the Mendocino coast where she lives, raises her son Gabriel, and pursues an important psychoanalysis, Elizabeth grapples with the ferocious desire for perfection which has shaped her personal life and writing life. Eventually, she finds love and acceptance in the most unlikely place, and finally accepts an “as is” relationship with herself and others.<br /><br />Her final triumph is the writing of this extraordinary memoir, filled with wit, humor, and heart—a brave book that repeatedly searches for the emotional truth beneath the conventional surface of existence.",3.29,240,Hardcover, ,40,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46178699-scratched,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46178699-scratched

  <b>A stunning, deeply reported investigation into the housing crisis </b>
</b><br /><br />Spacious and affordable homes used to be the hallmark of American prosperity. Today, however, punishing rents and the increasingly prohibitive cost of ownership have turned housing into the foremost symbol of inequality and an economy gone wrong. Nowhere is this more visible than in the San Francisco Bay Area, where fleets of private buses ferry software engineers past the tarp-and-plywood shanties where the homeless make their homes. The adage that California is a glimpse of the nation's future has become a cautionary tale.<br /><br />With propulsive storytelling and ground-level reporting, <i>New York Times</i> journalist Conor Dougherty chronicles America's housing crisis from its West Coast epicenter, peeling back the decades of history and economic forces that brought us here and taking readers inside the activist uprisings that have risen in tandem with housing costs. <br /><br />To tell this new story of housing, Dougherty follows a struggling math teacher who builds a political movement dedicated to ending single-family-house neighborhoods. A teenaged girl who leads her apartment complex against their rent-raising landlord. A nun who tries to outmaneuver private equity investors by amassing a multimillion-dollar portfolio of affordable homes. A suburban bureaucrat who roguishly embraces density in response to the threat of climate change. A developer who manufactures homeless housing on an assembly line.<br /><br />Sweeping in scope and intimate in detail, <i>Golden Gates</i> definitively captures a fundamental political realignment in America as it plays out during a moment of rapid technological and social change.",4.09,288,Hardcover, ,135,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46183582-golden-gates,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46183582-golden-gates

They live everywhere<b>—</b>deep inside caves, 18,000 feet high in the Himalayas, inside computers, in Yellowstone’s hot springs, and in the ears and nostrils of much larger creatures. There are insects that have ears on their knees, eyes on their penises, and tongues under their feet. Most of us think life would be better without bugs. In fact, life would be impossible without them.<br /> <br />Most of us know that we would not have honey without honeybees, but without the pinhead-sized chocolate midge, cocoa flowers would not pollinate. No cocoa, no chocolate. The ink that was used to write the Declaration of Independence was derived from galls on oak trees, which are induced by a small wasp. The fruit fly was essential to medical and biological research experiments that resulted in six Nobel prizes. Blowfly larva can clean difficult wounds; flour beetle larva can digest plastic; several species of insects have been essential to the development of antibiotics. Insects turn dead plants and animals into soil. They pollinate flowers, including crops that we depend on. They provide food for other animals, such as birds and bats. They control organisms that are harmful to humans. Life as we know it depends on these small creatures.<br /> <br />With ecologist Anne Sverdrup-Thygeson as our capable, entertaining guide into the insect world, we’ll learn that there is more variety among insects than we can even imagine and the more you learn about insects, the more fascinating they become.<i> Buzz, Sting, Bite </i>is an essential introduction to the little creatures that make the world go round.",4.18,257,Kindle Edition, ,115,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46226357-buzz-sting-bite,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46226357-buzz-sting-bite

With her trademark black humor, Maddow takes us on a switchback journey around the globe—from Oklahoma City to Siberia to Equatorial Guinea—exposing the greed and incompetence of Big Oil and Gas. She shows how Russia’s rich reserves of crude have, paradoxically, stunted its growth, forcing Putin to maintain his power by spreading Russia's rot into its rivals, its neighbors, the United States, and the West’s most important alliances. Chevron, BP, and a host of other industry players get their star turn, but ExxonMobil and the deceptively well-behaved Rex Tillerson emerge as two of the past century's most consequential corporate villains. The oil-and-gas industry has weakened democracies in developed and developing countries, fouled oceans and rivers, and propped up authoritarian thieves and killers. But being outraged at it is, according to Maddow, “like being indignant when a lion takes down and eats a gazelle. You can't really blame the lion. It's in her nature.”<br /><br />This book is a clarion call to contain the lion: to stop subsidizing the wealthiest industry on earth, to fight for transparency, and to check the influence of predatory oil executives and their enablers. The stakes have never been higher. As Maddow writes, “Democracy either wins this one or disappears.”",4.36, ,Audible Audio,Unabridged,58,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46253191-blowout,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46253191-blowout

She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, <i>progress</i>.<br /><br />Anna arrived during a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street. But amid the company ski vacations and in-office speakeasies, boyish camaraderie and ride-or-die corporate fealty, a new Silicon Valley began to emerge: one in far over its head, one that enriched itself at the expense of the idyllic future it claimed to be building.<br /><br />Part coming-of-age-story, part portrait of an already bygone era, Anna Wiener's memoir, <i>Uncanny Valley</i>, is a rare first-person glimpse into high-flying, reckless startup culture at a time of unchecked ambition, unregulated surveillance, wild fortune, and accelerating political power.

  <br />
</b> There is nothing more important than beating Donald Trump in 2020, but defeating Trump is just the start of this timely book. <i>Un-Trumping America</i> offers readers three critical insights: first, Trump is not an aberration, but rather the logical extension of the modern Republican Party; second, how Democrats can defeat Trump in 2020; and third, preventing the likes of Trump from ever happening again with a plan to fix democracy.<br /><br />While the catalog of the president's crimes is long and growing, undoing Trumpism -- the political platform of racism, authoritarianism, and plutocracy that gave rise to Trump and defines the Republican Party -- is a long and continuing fight. Through a craven, cynical strategy engineered by Mitch McConnell, funded by the Kochs, and fueled by Fox News propaganda, Republicans have rigged American politics to drown out the voices of the people in favor of the powerful. Without an aggressive response that recognizes who the Republicans are and what they have done, American democracy as we know it won't survive this moment and a conservative, shrinking, mostly white minority will govern the country for decades.<br /><br /><i>Un-Trumping</i> <i>America</i> dismantles toxic Trumpism and offers a way forward. Dan Pfeiffer worked for nearly twenty years at the center of Democratic politics, from the campaign trail to Capitol Hill to Barack Obama's White House. But it was Trump's victory and Republicans' incessant aiding and abetting of Trumpism that has radicalized his thinking. Here, Pfeiffer urges Democrats to embrace bold solutions -- from fixing the courts to abolishing the electoral college to eliminating the filibuster -- in order to make America more democratic (and Democratic).<br /><br /><i>Un-Trumping America</i> is a powerful call for Democrats and progressives to get smarter, tougher, and more aggressive without becoming a paler shade of orange.",4.24,304,Kindle Edition, ,33,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48557334-un-trumping-america,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48557334-un-trumping-america

Born in a bathtub in 1954 to a Cherokee father and white mother, Betty is the sixth of eight siblings. The world they inhabit is one of poverty and violence--both from outside the family, and also, devastatingly, from within. The lush landscape, rich with birdsong, wild fruit, and blazing stars, becomes a kind of refuge for Betty, but when her family's darkest secrets are brought to light, she has no choice but to reckon with the brutal history hiding in the hills, as well as the heart-wrenching cruelties and incredible characters she encounters in her rural town of Breathed, Ohio.<br /><br /> But despite the hardship she faces, Betty is resilient. Her curiosity about the natural world, her fierce love for her sisters, and her father's brilliant stories are kindling for the fire of her own imagination, and in the face of all she bears witness to, Betty discovers an escape: she begins to write. She recounts the horrors of her family's past and present with pen and paper and buries them deep in the dirt--moments that has stung her so deeply, she could not tell them, until now.<br /><br /> Inspired by the life of her own mother, Tiffany McDaniel sets out to free the past by telling this heartbreaking yet magical story--a remarkable novel that establishes her as one of the freshest and most important voices in American fiction.",4.45,416,Hardcover, ,566,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48564330-betty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48564330-betty

  <b> comes a new novel inspired by historical events: a dramatic story of three young women on a journey in search of family amidst the destruction of the post-Civil War South, and of a modern-day teacher who rediscovers their story and its vital connection to her own students' lives.</b>
</b><br /><br />In her distinctive voice, Lisa Wingate brings to life startling stories from actual ""Lost Friends"" advertisements that appeared in Southern newspapers after the Civil War, as freed slaves desperately searched for loved ones who had been sold off.<br /><br /><b>Louisiana, 1875: </b> In the tumultuous aftermath of Reconstruction, three young women set off as unwilling companions on a perilous quest: Lavinia, the pampered heir to a now-destitute plantation; Juneau Jane, her illegitimate free-born Creole half-sister; and Hannie, Lavinia's former slave. Each carries private wounds and powerful secrets as they head for Texas, following dangerous roads rife with ruthless vigilantes and soldiers still fighting a war lost a decade before. For Lavinia and Juneau Jane, the journey is one of inheritance and financial desperation, but for Hannie, torn from her mother and eight siblings before slavery's end, the pilgrimage westward reignites an agonizing question: Could her long-lost family still be out there? Beyond the swamps lie the seemingly limitless frontiers of Texas and, improbably, hope.<br /><br /><b>Louisiana, 1987: </b> For first-year teacher Benedetta Silva, a subsidized job at a poor rural school seems like the ticket to canceling her hefty student debt—until she lands in a tiny, out-of-step Mississippi River town. Augustine, Louisiana, seems suspicious of new ideas and new people, and Benny can scarcely comprehend the lives of her poverty-stricken students.

Though both the right- and left-wing media claim “objectivity” in their reporting of these and other contentious issues, the American public has become increasingly cynical about truth, fact, and reality. In <i>The View from Somewhere</i>, Lewis Raven Wallace dives deep into the history of “objectivity” in journalism and how its been used to gatekeep and silence marginalized writers as far back as Ida B. Wells.<br /><br /> <br /><br />At its core, this is a book about fierce journalists who have pursued truth and transparency and sometimes been punished for it—not just by tyrannical governments but by journalistic institutions themselves. He highlights the stories of journalists who question “objectivity” with sensitivity and passion: Desmond Cole of the <i>Toronto Star</i>; <i>New York Times</i> reporter Linda Greenhouse; Pulitzer Prize-winner Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah; Peabody-winning podcaster John Biewen; <i>Guardian</i> correspondent Gary Younge; former <i>Buzzfeed</i> reporter Meredith Talusan; and many others. Wallace also shares his own experiences as a midwestern transgender journalist and activist who was fired from his job as a national reporter for public radio for speaking out against “objectivity” in coverage of Trump and white supremacy. <br /><br /> <br /><br />With insightful steps through history, Wallace stresses that journalists have never been mere passive observers—the choices they make reflect worldviews tinted by race, class, gender, and geography. He upholds the centrality of facts and the necessary discipline of verification but argues against the long-held standard of “objective” media coverage that asks journalists to claim they are without bias. Using historical and contemporary examples—from lynching in the nineteenth century to transgender issues in the twenty-first—Wallace offers a definitive critique of “objectivity” as a catchall for accurate journalism. He calls for the dismissal of this damaging mythology in order to confront the realities of institutional power, racism, and other forms of oppression and exploitation in the news industry.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Now more than ever, journalism that resists extractive, exploitive, and tokenistic practices toward marginalized people isn’t just important—it is essential. Combining Wallace’s intellectual and emotional journey with the wisdom of others’ experiences, <i>The View from Somewhere</i> is a compelling rallying cry against journalist neutrality and for the validity of news told from distinctly subjective voices.  <br /><br /> ",4.42,245,Kindle Edition, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48647549-the-view-from-somewhere,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48647549-the-view-from-somewhere

Wiseman has written a touching tale of loss, survival, and perseverance with some light fantastical elements. Highly recommended.” <br />—<i>Booklist</i><br /><br />“An immersive historical tale with chilling twists and turns. Beautifully told and richly imagined.”<br />—Stephanie Dray, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>America’s First Daughter</i></b><br /><br />In the fall of 1918, thirteen-year-old German immigrant Pia Lange longs to be far from Philadelphia’s overcrowded slums and the anti-immigrant sentiment that compelled her father to enlist in the U.S. Army. But as her city celebrates the end of war, an even more urgent threat arrives: the Spanish flu. Funeral crepe and quarantine signs appear on doors as victims drop dead in the streets and desperate survivors wear white masks to ward off illness. When food runs out in the cramped tenement she calls home, Pia must venture alone into the quarantined city in search of supplies, leaving her baby brothers behind.<br /> <br />Bernice Groves has become lost in grief and bitterness since her baby died from the Spanish flu. Watching Pia leave her brothers alone, Bernice makes a shocking, life-altering decision. It becomes her sinister mission to tear families apart when they’re at their most vulnerable, planning to transform the city’s orphans and immigrant children into what she feels are “true Americans.”<br /> <br />Waking in a makeshift hospital days after collapsing in the street, Pia is frantic to return home. Instead, she is taken to St. Vincent’s Orphan Asylum – the first step in a long and arduous journey. As Bernice plots to keep the truth hidden at any cost in the months and years that follow, Pia must confront her own shame and fear, risking everything to see justice – and love – triumph at last. Powerful, harrowing, and ultimately exultant, The Orphan Collector is a story of love, resilience, and the lengths we will go to protect those who need us most.<br /><br /><b>“Wiseman’s writing is superb, and her descriptions of life during the Spanish Flu epidemic are chilling.

</p><p>On the night of May 19, 1962, the marquee of the old Madison Square Garden boasted: “BEST THING TODAY…JOHN F. KENNEDY / 2ND BEST THING…MARILYN MONROE.”</p><p>Few things illustrate the magnetism of the Kennedy era like Marilyn Monroe co-headlining the President’s massive birthday fundraiser, and suggestively crooning “Happy Birthday.” But only a privileged few know what happened months earlier, when the two icons spent a weekend at a private summit hosted by Bing Crosby, and later, after the New York extravaganza, at the top secret, invitation-only midnight affair at a millionaire’s Manhattan town house.</p><p>For more than half a century, this exclusive, no-press-allowed after-party has been shrouded in rumor and myth. Lot 6191 in the 2010 auction of White House photographer Cecil Stoughton’s archive—“Marilyn Monroe at JFK Party”—included twenty-three prints. Their negatives, marked in Stoughton’s hand with “Sensitive material, Do not file,” were seized by the National Archives. Among the collection: the sole existing photograph of Marilyn and the president. Spellbound by the intimacy of the image and the force of public imagination, bestselling historian James Swanson masterfully reconstructs the fabled soiree, bringing alive a night that history nearly left behind.</p>",3.29,46,Kindle Edition, ,141,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48714728-second-best-thing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48714728-second-best-thing

Still, when detectives asked for victims to come forward, she sent a note.<br /><br />Her criminal case file reopened, she saw for the first time evidence that corroborated her memories. Here were depictions of the naïve, hard-working girl she'd been, a chorister and debater, the daughter of a priest; of the two senior athletes who assaulted her and were allowed to graduate with awards; and of the faculty, doctors, and priests who had known about Crawford's assault and gone to great lengths to bury it.<br /><br />Now a wife, mother, and writer living on the other side of the country, Crawford learned that police had uncovered astonishing proof of an institutional silencing years before, and that unnamed powers were still trying to block her case. The slander, innuendo, and lack of adult concern that Crawford had experienced as a student hadn't been imagined as the effects of trauma, after all: these were the actions of a school that prized its reputation above anything, even a child.<br /><br />This revelation launched Crawford on an extraordinary inquiry into the ways gender, privilege, and power shaped her experience as a girl at the gates of America's elite. Her investigation looks beyond the sprawling playing fields and soaring chapel towers of crucibles of power like St. Paul's, whose reckoning is still to come.

  <b>From the celebrated author of <i>American Philosophy: A Love Story</i> and <i>Hiking with Nietzsche</i>, a compelling introduction to the life-affirming philosophy of William James</b>
</p><p>In 1895, William James, the father of American philosophy, delivered a lecture entitled ""Is Life Worth Living?"" It was no theoretical question for James, who had contemplated suicide during an existential crisis as a young man a quarter century earlier. Indeed, as John Kaag writes, ""James's entire philosophy, from beginning to end, was geared to save a life, <i>his</i> life""—and that's why it just might be able to save yours, too. <i>Sick Souls, Healthy Minds</i> is a compelling introduction to James's life and thought that shows why the founder of pragmatism and empirical psychology—and an inspiration for Alcoholics Anonymous—can still speak so directly and profoundly to anyone struggling to make a life worth living.</p><p>Kaag tells how James's experiences as one of what he called the ""sick-souled,"" those who think that life might be meaningless, drove him to articulate an ideal of ""healthy-mindedness""—an attitude toward life that is open, active, and hopeful, but also realistic about its risks. In fact, all of James's pragmatism, resting on the idea that truth should be judged by its practical consequences for our lives, is a response to, and possible antidote for, crises of meaning that threaten to undo many of us at one time or another. Along the way, Kaag also movingly describes how his own life has been endlessly enriched by James.</p><p>Eloquent, inspiring, and filled with insight, <i>Sick Souls, Healthy Minds</i> may be the smartest and most important self-help book you'll ever read.</p>",3.83,160,Kindle Edition, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48719696-sick-souls-healthy-minds,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48719696-sick-souls-healthy-minds

Having fully recovered from a brutal divorce nearly two decades earlier, she has successfully raised her kids, Juliet and Theo, seeing them off to college and beyond. As the owner of a popular boutique on Nantucket, she's built a fulfilling life for herself on the island where she grew up. With her beloved house in desperate need of repair, Lisa calls on Mack Whitney, a friendly--and very handsome--local contractor and fellow single parent, to do the work. The two begin to grow close, and Lisa is stunned to realize that she might be willing to open up again after all . . . despite the fact that Mack is ten years her junior.<br /><br />Juliet and Theo worry that Mack will only break their mother's heart--and they can't bear to see her hurt again. Both stuck in ruts of their own, they each hope that a summer on Nantucket will provide them with the clarity they've been searching for. When handsome entrepreneur Ryder Hastings moves to the island to expand his environmental nonprofit, Juliet, an MIT-educated web designer, feels an immediate attraction, one her rocky love life history pushes her to deny at first. Meanwhile, free spirit Theo finds his California bliss comes to a brutal halt when a surfing injury forces him back to the East Coast. Upon his return, he has eyes only for Mack's daughter, Beth, to whom he is bound by an unspeakable tragedy from high school. Can they overcome their past?<br /><br />As the season unfolds, a storm threatens to shatter the peace of the golden island, forcing Lisa, Juliet, and Theo to decide whether their summer romances are destined for something more profound.

I was the wife of Jesus.""</i> So begins the new novel from the number one <i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i> and <i>The Invention of Wings</i>, an extraordinary story set in the first century about a woman who finds her voice and her destiny in a time of great despair and great hope.</b><br /><br />In her fourth work of fiction, Sue Monk Kidd brings her acclaimed narrative gifts to imagine the story of a young woman named Ana. Raised in a wealthy family in Sepphoris with ties to the ruler of Galilee, she is rebellious and ambitious, a relentless seeker with a brilliant, curious mind and a daring spirit. She yearns for a pursuit worthy of her life, but finds no outlet for her considerable talents. Defying the expectations placed on women, she engages in furtive scholarly pursuits and writes secret narratives about neglected and silenced women. When she meets the eighteen-year-old Jesus, each is drawn to and enriched by the other's spiritual and philosophical ideas. He becomes a floodgate for her intellect, but also the awakener of her heart. <br /><br />Their marriage unfolds with love and conflict, humor and pathos in Nazareth, where Ana makes a home with Jesus, his brothers, James and Simon, and their mother, Mary. Here, Ana's pent-up longings intensify amid the turbulent resistance to the Roman occupation of Israel, partially led by her charismatic adopted brother, Judas. She is sustained by her indomitable aunt Yaltha, who is searching for her long-lost daughter, as well as by other women, including her friend Tabitha, who is sold into slavery after she was raped, and Phasaelis, the shrewd wife of Herod Antipas. Ana's impetuous streak occasionally invites danger. When one such foray forces her to flee Nazareth for her safety shortly before Jesus's public ministry begins, she makes her way with Yaltha to Alexandria, where she eventually finds refuge and purpose in unexpected surroundings.<br /><br />Grounded in meticulous historical research and written with a reverential approach to Jesus's life that focuses on his humanity, <i>The Book of Longings</i> is an inspiring account of one woman's bold struggle to realize the passion and potential inside her, while living in a time, place, and culture devised to silence her.",4.25,432,Kindle Edition, ,606,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48739558-the-book-of-longings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48739558-the-book-of-longings

Son los años de la junta militar, hay controles de soldados armados y tensión en el ambiente. El hijo se llama Gaspar y el padre trata de protegerlo del destino que le ha sido asignado. La madre murió en circunstancias poco claras, en un accidente que acaso no lo fue.<br /><br />Como su padre, Gaspar está llamado a ser un médium en una sociedad secreta, la Orden, que contacta con la Oscuridad en busca de la vida eterna mediante atroces rituales. En ellos es vital disponer de un médium, pero el destino de estos seres dotados de poderes especiales es cruel, porque su desgaste físico y mental es rápido e implacable. Los orígenes de la Orden, regida por la poderosa familia de la madre de Gaspar, se remontan a siglos atrás, cuando el conocimiento de la Oscuridad llegó desde el corazón de África a Inglaterra y desde allí se extendió hasta Argentina.<br /><br />El lector encontrará en estas páginas casas cuyo interior muta; pasadizos que esconden monstruos inimaginables; rituales con fieros y extáticos sacrificios humanos; andanzas en el Londres psicodélico de los años sesenta, donde la madre de Gaspar conoció a un joven cantante de aire andrógino llamado David; párpados humanos convertidos en fetiches; enigmáticas liturgias sexuales; la relación entre padres e hijos, con la carga de una herencia atroz; y, de fondo, la represión de la dictadura militar, los desaparecidos y, más adelante, la incierta llegada de la democracia, los primeros brotes del sida en Buenos Aires...

Es una maestra de lo macabro que no apela a emociones baratas, sino que cada pequeño detalle de oscuridad está allí por una razón y cada una de sus historias contiene una carga política» (Anne Meadows, Granta).<br /><br />«Mariana Enriquez muestra todo y lo muestra con morbo.

But headstrong, passionate Laura wants more, and when she takes a leap of faith and applies to the Columbia Journalism School, her world is cracked wide open. As her studies take her all over the city, she finds herself drawn to Greenwich Village's new bohemia, where she discovers the Heterodoxy Club--a radical, all-female group in which women are encouraged to loudly share their opinions on suffrage, birth control, and women's rights. Soon, Laura finds herself questioning her traditional role as wife and mother. But when valuable books are stolen back at the library, threatening the home and institution she loves, she's forced to confront her shifting priorities head on . . . and may just lose everything in the process.<br /><br />Eighty years later, in 1993, Sadie Donovan struggles with the legacy of her grandmother, the famous essayist Laura Lyons, especially after she's wrangled her dream job as a curator at the New York Public Library. But the job quickly becomes a nightmare when rare manuscripts, notes, and books for the exhibit Sadie's running begin disappearing from the library's famous Berg Collection. Determined to save both the exhibit and her career, the typically risk-adverse Sadie teams up with a private security expert to uncover the culprit. However, things unexpectedly become personal when the investigation leads Sadie to some unwelcome truths about her own family heritage--truths that shed new light on the biggest tragedy in the library's history.",3.95,354,Hardcover, ,1597,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48814109-the-lions-of-fifth-avenue,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48814109-the-lions-of-fifth-avenue

Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.<br /><br />Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren't found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of S�o Paulo.

She freezes; it’s an image of a book she hasn’t seen in sixty-five years—a book she recognizes as <i>The Book of Lost Names</i>.<br /> <br />The accompanying article discusses the looting of libraries by the Nazis across Europe during World War II—an experience Eva remembers well—and the search to reunite people with the texts taken from them so long ago. The book in the photograph, an eighteenth-century religious text thought to have been taken from France in the waning days of the war, is one of the most fascinating cases. Now housed in Berlin’s Zentral- und Landesbibliothek library, it appears to contain some sort of code, but researchers don’t know where it came from—or what the code means. Only Eva holds the answer—but will she have the strength to revisit old memories and help reunite those lost during the war?<br /> <br />As a graduate student in 1942, Eva was forced to flee Paris after the arrest of her father, a Polish Jew. Finding refuge in a small mountain town in the Free Zone, she begins forging identity documents for Jewish children fleeing to neutral Switzerland. But erasing people comes with a price, and along with a mysterious, handsome forger named Rémy, Eva decides she must find a way to preserve the real names of the children who are too young to remember who they really are. The records they keep in <i>The Book of Lost Names</i> will become even more vital when the resistance cell they work for is betrayed and Rémy disappears.<br /> <br />An engaging and evocative novel reminiscent of <i>The Lost Girls of Paris</i> and <i>The Alice Network</i>, <i>The Book of Lost Names </i>is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of bravery and love in the face of evil.",4.39,400,Kindle Edition, ,294,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48891324-the-book-of-lost-names,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48891324-the-book-of-lost-names

But headstrong, passionate Laura wants more, and when she takes a leap of faith and applies to the Columbia Journalism School, her world is cracked wide open. As her studies take her all over the city, she finds herself drawn to Greenwich Village's new bohemia, where she discovers the Heterodoxy Club—a radical, all-female group in which women are encouraged to loudly share their opinions on suffrage, birth control, and women's rights. Soon, Laura finds herself questioning her traditional role as wife and mother. But when valuable books are stolen back at the library, threatening the home and institution she loves, she's forced to confront her shifting priorities head on . . . and may just lose everything in the process.<br /><br /> Eighty years later, in 1993, Sadie Donovan struggles with the legacy of her grandmother, the famous essayist Laura Lyons, especially after she's wrangled her dream job as a curator at the New York Public Library. But the job quickly becomes a nightmare when rare manuscripts, notes, and books for the exhibit Sadie's running begin disappearing from the library's famous Berg Collection. Determined to save both the exhibit and her career, the typically risk-adverse Sadie teams up with a private security expert to uncover the culprit. However, things unexpectedly become personal when the investigation leads Sadie to some unwelcome truths about her own family heritage—truths that shed new light on the biggest tragedy in the library's history.",3.95,368,Kindle Edition, ,305,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48895793-the-lions-of-fifth-avenue,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48895793-the-lions-of-fifth-avenue

It examines the relationships women are forced to vessel: to family, to faith, to femininity. The collection interrogates the ways we are taught to be women, recounts what the body carries, asks what happens when we outgrow the love and loyalties we are raised to obey. <em>Boat Burned</em> delves into themes of hunger, divorce, violence, and our relationship to our own bodies, as it reminds us we are every boat we have lived and every boat we have set ablaze in order to build anew. <br /><br />Check Out the Reviews!<br />Rhino: <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://rhinopoetry.org/reviews/boat-burned-by-kelly-grace-thomas-reviewed-by-donna-vorreyer"">https://rhinopoetry.org/reviews/boat-...</a><br />Cultural Weekly: <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""https://www.culturalweekly.com/review-boat-burned-kelly-grace-thomas/"">https://www.culturalweekly.com/review...</a><br /><br />Praise for <em>Boat Burned</em>:<br /><br />A ""tendertangle,"" a lush portmanteau, is how I drank and devoured the water-drenched poems of Kelly Grace Thomas's <em>Boat Burned</em>. This mercy-hearted work shows great concern and empathy for the twisted mess and mass of bodies—bodies as boats, bodies burning, body as a window, the lover’s body, and the parental body as a woven elegy and ode. This gorgeous debut is a sustained symphonic metaphor on what we carry in our vessels, all the damage and joy (inherited and otherwise) sailing and sinking and singing through magnificent verse. Thomas is a master of intense precision of feeling. The diction is hungry and barking ""for anything to love us back."" I am beyond excited for this brilliant and beautiful collection.<br />— Tiana Clark, author of <em>I Can't Talk About the Trees Without the Blood</em><br /><br />At the same time expansive and intimate, Kelly Grace Thomas’s debut collection navigates issues of loss, family, and agency. <em>Boat Burned</em> invites us to witness the pains and subsequent joys of rebirth—""The boats that built me / smoke on shore.” Thomas’s voice shines like a lighthouse beacon—guiding us through the difficult memories and toward the future’s open waters.<br />— Paige Lewis, author of <em>Space Struck</em><br /><br />“History is a dirty / ocean. And I am dangerous / with thirst,” says luminous poet Kelly Grace Thomas, in her spellbinding <em>Boat Burned</em>. The gorgeous poems that populate this powerful collection “rise // fully formed from sea.” These are elegant, crisp, clear, and potent poems that tackle such issues as impossible beauty standards, eating disorders, racist attitudes in the U.S., divorce, and family trauma, all while binding a thickly knotted rope of love between the speaker and her family, the speaker and the world around her.<br />— Jennifer Givhan, author of <em>Rosa’s Einstein</em><br /><br />In this remarkable inaugural collection, Kelly Grace Thomas reminds us water is where we are from, water is what we are made of, and water is where we’ll return. These formally dexterous poems invite the reader to consider how the craft of a poem is a physical object that helps keep us afloat. <em>Boat Burned</em> interrogates the moment where the embodied spirit butts up against the strictures and violence of an impossible world.

In <i>A Social Revolution</i>, Kevan Harris convincingly demonstrates how they are wrong. Previous studies ignore the forceful consequences of three decades of social change following the 1979 revolution. Today, more people in the country are connected to welfare and social policy institutions than to any other form of state organization. In fact, much of Iran’s current political turbulence is the result of the success of these social welfare programs, which have created newly educated and mobilized social classes advocating for change. Based on extensive fieldwork conducted in Iran, Harris shows how the revolutionary regime endured through the expansion of health, education, and aid programs that have both embedded the state in everyday life and empowered its challengers. This focus on the social policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran opens a new line of inquiry into the study of welfare states in countries where they are often overlooked or ignored.",4.00, , , ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48923982,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48923982

Known to far fewer people was their whip-smart and well-educated sister Katharine, a suffragette and early feminist.<br /><br />After Wilbur passed away, Katharine lived with and took care of her increasingly reclusive brother Orville, who often turned to his more confident and supportive sister to help him through fame and fortune. But when Katharine became engaged to their mutual friend, Harry Haskell, Orville felt abandoned and betrayed. He smashed a pitcher of flowers against a wall and refused to attend the wedding or speak to Katharine or Harry. As the years went on, the siblings grew further and further apart.<br /><br />In <em>The Wright Sister</em>, Patty Dann wonderfully imagines the blossoming of Katharine, revealed in her ""Marriage Diary""--in which she emerges as a frank, vibrant, intellectually and socially engaged, sexually active woman coming into her own--and her one-sided correspondence with her estranged brother as she hopes to repair their fractured relationship. Even though she pictures ""Orv"" throwing her letters away, Katharine cannot contain her joie de vivre, her love of married life, her strong advocacy of the suffragette cause, or her abiding affection for her stubborn sibling as she fondly recalls their shared life.<br /><br />An inspiring and poignant chronicle of feminism, family, and forgiveness, <em>The Wright Sister</em> is an unforgettable portrait of a woman, a sister of inventors, who found a way to reinvent herself.",3.20,218,Paperback, ,89,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48929880-the-wright-sister,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48929880-the-wright-sister

Older generations can reverse the aging process through weekly transfusions while, far removed from the realities of the outside world, aimless “blood chickens” can live a life of guiltless bliss in idyllic youth farms. Among the first wave of volunteer donors are Billy Cantor and Frankie Halifax, who quickly bond over their dream paradise. What’s not to love? Wine tastings, parties, yoga, and all the organic avocados they can eat. Best of all: not a single care in the world until their thirty-fifth birthdays. Then Billy and Frankie discover a few cracks in nirvana.

Both sought to redefine themselves beneath the stars. By the time they made it to the snowy Cascade Range of British Columbia—the trail’s end—Aspen and Justin were in love.</p><p>Embarking on a new pilgrimage the next summer, they returned to those same mossy mountains where they’d met, and they married.

Until a cold November morning, when, after kissing Aspen goodbye, Justin left to attend the funeral of a close friend.</p><p>He never came back. As days became weeks, her husband’s inexplicable absence left Aspen unmoored. Shock, grief, fear, and anger battled for control—but nothing prepared her for the disarming truth. A revelation that would lead Aspen to reassess not only her own life but that of the disappeared as well.</p><p>The result is a brave and inspiring memoir of secrets kept and unearthed, of a vanishing that became a gift: a woman’s empowering reclamation of unmitigated <i>purpose</i> in the surreal wake of mystifying loss.</p>",3.65,305,Kindle Edition, ,377,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49023602-your-blue-is-not-my-blue,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49023602-your-blue-is-not-my-blue

The Great War. Although the world is at war, Delia Markham is adjusting to her job as a typewriting teacher at the Glennon Normal School in the fall term of 1918. Her new life revolves around teaching future teachers. It isn’t an easy transition from her former assignment as Yeoman (F) in the U. S. Naval Reserve. <br /> <br />When the call was made for women to help in the war effort, Delia was one of the first to sign up for a four-year enlistment using a loophole in the language that allowed women to join the service. That loophole relieved men of the clerical duties that kept them from combat. It offered women equal pay and rank for the same work. Thousands rushed forward to fill that gap. To differentiate them from other yeomen, the (f) designation was used. <br /> <br />After spending years caring for her parents and ultimately losing them both, joining the service in the spring of 1917 was an exciting opportunity. One she relished for the time she put in as the amanuensis to a high-ranking officer. Her life with the admiral and his wife allowed her to grow, learn new skills, and enjoy new experiences until she was sidelined in the summer of 1918 by an incident that meant the abrupt end of her military career. A career that was as exciting as it was fulfilling. <br /> <br />Circumstances and a remaining family connection brought Delia to the Glennon Normal School when other doors were closed to her. She was happy to have the job and her new home with her cousin Hazel, the head chef at the school. But life at the teachers’ training school isn’t quite as exciting as her time in the service. Not until a mystery at Glennon Hall is followed by a murder and Delia finds herself drawn into both. <br /> <br />Suddenly, some of the past excitement found its way back into her life. <br />",4.07,201,Kindle Edition, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49045505-mystery-at-glennon-hall,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49045505-mystery-at-glennon-hall

Discover the fascinating true story of one of the most influential and misunderstood secret brotherhoods in modern society.</b><b>
  <br />
</b>Founded in London in 1717 as a way of binding men in fellowship, Freemasonry proved so addictive that within two decades it had spread across the globe. Masonic influence became pervasive. Under George Washington, the Craft became a creed for the new American nation. Masonic networks held the British empire together. Under Napoleon, the Craft became a tool of authoritarianism and then a cover for revolutionary conspiracy. Both the Mormon Church and the Sicilian mafia owe their origins to Freemasonry. <br />Yet the Masons were as feared as they were influential. In the eyes of the Catholic Church, Freemasonry has always been a den of devil-worshippers. For Hitler, Mussolini and Franco, the Lodges spread the diseases of pacifism, socialism and Jewish influence, so had to be crushed. <br />Freemasonry's story yokes together Winston Churchill and Walt Disney; Wolfgang Mozart and Shaquille O'Neal; Benjamin Franklin and Buzz Aldrin; Rudyard Kipling and 'Buffalo Bill' Cody; Duke Ellington and the Duke of Wellington. <br />John Dickie's <i>The Craft</i> is an enthralling exploration of a the world's most famous and misunderstood secret brotherhood, a movement that not only helped to forge modern society, but has substantial contemporary influence, with 400,000 members in Britain, over a million in the USA, and around six million across the world.",3.79,496,Hardcover, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49089580-the-craft,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49089580-the-craft

  <b>Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings reveals for the first time the unorthodox culture behind one of the world's most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies</b>
</b><br /><br />There has never before been a company like Netflix. It has led nothing short of a revolution in the entertainment industries, generating billions of dollars in annual revenue while capturing the imaginations of hundreds of millions of people in over 190 countries. But to reach these great heights, Netflix, which launched in 1998 as an online DVD rental service, has had to reinvent itself over and over again. This type of unprecedented flexibility would have been impossible without the counterintuitive and radical management principles that cofounder Reed Hastings established from the very beginning. Hastings rejected the conventional wisdom under which other companies operate and defied tradition to instead build a culture focused on freedom and responsibility, one that has allowed Netflix to adapt and innovate as the needs of its members and the world have simultaneously transformed.<br /><br />Hastings set new standards, valuing people over process, emphasizing innovation over efficiency, and giving employees context, not controls. At Netflix, there are no vacation or expense policies. At Netflix, adequate performance gets a generous severance, and hard work is irrel-evant. At Netflix, you don't try to please your boss, you give candid feedback instead. At Netflix, employees don't need approval, and the company pays top of market. When Hastings and his team first devised these unorthodox principles, the implications were unknown and untested. But in just a short period, their methods led to unparalleled speed and boldness, as Netflix quickly became one of the most loved brands in the world.<br /><br />Here for the first time, Hastings and Erin Meyer, bestselling author of <i>The Culture Map </i>and one of the world's most influential business thinkers, dive deep into the controversial ideologies at the heart of the Netflix psyche, which have generated results that are the envy of the business world. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with current and past Netflix employees from around the globe and never-before-told stories of trial and error from Hastings's own career, <i>No Rules Rules </i>is the fascinating and untold account of the philosophy behind one of the world's most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies.",4.33,464,Paperback, ,242,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49099937-no-rules-rules,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49099937-no-rules-rules

Yet by blending an old-school brand of baseball with modern analytics, they managed to sneak into the playoffs and put together the most unlikely postseason run in baseball history.

As a species, we have more or less conquered the entire Earth and all of its resources. We have built towering structures, intricate systems and settled everywhere — from the tallest peaks to the deepest valleys. <br /> <br />We have now entered what many like to think of as the enlightened, scientific era — where old superstitions and fears have been abolished, and the mysteries of the past have been solved. Basically, many of us like to think we have figured it all out. <br /> <br />However, whether we want to admit it or not, we are still surrounded by plenty of enigmas. Unexplained phenomena, such as confirmed instances of remote viewing or sightings of strange beings like Bigfoot, may sow a seed of doubt in even the surest of individuals. <br /> <br />While some sneer at, or shy away from, the thought of investigating the mysterious, there are also those who feel curious, maybe even energized, at the thought of exploring something completely new. <br /> <br />As Neil Armstrong once said: <br /><i>“Mystery creates wonder, and wonder is the basis for man’s desire to understand”. </i> <br /> <br />If you are one of those who seek to feel wonder, this book is for you. Herein you will find a varied collection of some of the most intriguing unexplained mysteries of our time. <br /> <br /><b>From the puzzling artifacts of a lost civilization, to psychic visions and shocking UFO landings — by the end of this book, you will have plenty of captivating questions to ponder and investigate further.</b> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Book 2: Bigfoot &amp; The Other Ones  <br /> <br />Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch, is thought to be a large, hairy, ape-like being that inhabits some of the dense forests and remote mountain ranges of North America. <br /> <br />Although solid, scientific evidence of the creature is lacking, stories of sightings and encounters have been steadily accumulating throughout the years. <br /> <br />As a result, Bigfoot has been placed in the category of so-called “cryptids” — creatures that are thought by some to exist on Earth, but have yet to be properly documented by modern science. <br /> <br />Others in this category include the mysterious, waterborne, dinosaur-like being popularly-known as “the Loch Ness monster”, as well as the goat-eating Chupacabra of South America. <br /> <br />Due to the sheer volume of eyewitness accounts involving Bigfoot, most people in the Western hemisphere recognize the general description of this creature. What few may realize, however, is that the Sasquatch is not unique to North America. Or, at least, stories of mysterious, bipedal hominids are not. <br /> <br />From the mountainous regions of Nepal to the wild outback of Australia, tales of such beings have existed throughout history. In many cases, the descriptions of these creatures seem to match Bigfoot. <br /> <br />So, then, a few questions naturally arise: <br /> <br />Are these all part of a singular, long-lost species of great ape, or are they separate beings with different genetic lineages? <br /> <br />How similar are they to each other, where do they to live, and is there any evidence of their existence? <br /> <br />We will explore these questions, and many more, in this book.",3.87,200,Kindle Edition, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49129855-unexplained-mysteries,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49129855-unexplained-mysteries

  <b>A stunning, deeply reported investigation into the housing crisis </b>
</b><br /><br />Cities are the engines of economic progress and the places that give birth to ideas that shape our lives. For generations, arriving in a major city was the first step toward the American Dream. But as housing costs skyrocket in job-rich cities across the nation, that door to opportunity is swinging shut.<br /><br />No place has felt this more acutely than the San Francisco Bay Area, where the mansions of tech billionaires stand streets away from encampments of cardboard. With riveting block-by-block reporting, <i>New York Times</i> reporter Conor Dougherty parses the history and economic forces that underlie the crisis from its epicenter. As rising rents and home prices have spread across the country, massive movements against single-family zoning and for tenants' rights have followed.<br /><br />The potent forces of racism have long shaped the narrative of home ownership in this country. Today, as we grapple with that legacy, the crisis is deepened by globalization and made all the more pressing in the face of climate change. Despite its liberal reputation, the San Francisco Bay Area has for decades enacted and reinforced exclusionist housing policies that raise the cost of living and exacerbate inequality. When Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO of Yelp, wanted to disrupt the rising housing costs in the Bay Area, he bypassed the traditional halls of power and instead met with the leader of SF BARF, the SF Bay Area Renters' Federation, Sonja Trauss. Indignant over the cost of living in our nation's great cities, Trauss represents a new generation of activists frustrated by a growing shortage of housing and demanding that neighborhoods make room for them. Dougherty follows Trauss--along with families trapped in the churn of barely making rent, a nun building a real estate empire to outmaneuver gauging landlords, and a city planner who suddenly envisions a different future--to tell the new story of housing.<br /><br />Sweeping in scope and intimate in detail, Golden Gates definitively captures a fundamental political realignment in America as it plays out during a moment of rapid technological and social change.",4.09, ,Audible Audio,Unabridged,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49194842-golden-gates,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49194842-golden-gates

  <strong>Exploring the psychological dynamics of the relationship between a precocious yet naïve teenage girl and her magnetic and manipulative teacher, a brilliant, all-consuming read that marks the explosive debut of an extraordinary new writer.</strong>
</p><p><em>2000</em>. Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher. </p><p><em>2017.</em> Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed?</p><p>Alternating between Vanessa’s present and her past, <em>My Dark Vanessa</em> juxtaposes memory and trauma with the breathless excitement of a teenage girl discovering the power her own body can wield. Thought-provoking and impossible to put down, this is a masterful portrayal of troubled adolescence and its repercussions that raises vital questions about agency, consent, complicity, and victimhood. Written with the haunting intimacy of <em>The Girls</em> and the creeping intensity of <em>Room, My Dark Vanessa</em> is an era-defining novel that brilliantly captures and reflects the shifting cultural mores transforming our relationships and society itself.</p>",4.04,16,Audiobook,Unabridged,200,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49384289-my-dark-vanessa,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49384289-my-dark-vanessa

Bobby gives Bess critical advice (on career and romance; lipstick and hair). And she relates the history that made her who she is, beginning with her mother's escape from the pogroms of Belarus in the 1880s to the cramped Brooklyn apartment where Bobby was born; and Bobby's own marriage to a successful businessman, which made possible the educations that helped her children and grandchildren flourish.<br /><br />But from the time Bess was born, Bobby bestowed a unique flavor of love upon her granddaughter: tea at the Plaza; new dresses at Bloomingdales; and above all, her nobody-will-tell-you-this-but-me truths, full of devotion and well meaning, even when they hurt.<br /><br />This unusual love story celebrates the very special bond that can skip a generation and hold iron-clad.

Also, there was that strange, annoying feeling that he was being watched . . . <br /> <br />Humankind was indeed being evaluated, by the highly advanced Khantam Lom, an alien species in control of much of the galaxy. Did this selfish, war-mongering, human race warrant protection from the soon-to be-invading Wikk Empire? An insectile species with insatiable appetites, the Wikk were hell-bent on subjugating Earth as one of their many farming settlements. <br /> <br />So the adventure begins. Dominic inadvertently saves the life of a Khantam Lom Observer, and everything changes. Humankind has but one—seeming impossible—shot at avoiding a catastrophic fate. Dominic won’t be able to do it alone, but will the ragtag team he’s assembled be enough? Will any of them survive long enough to make a difference? <br />",4.30,400,Kindle Edition, ,60,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49552502-guardian-ship,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49552502-guardian-ship

""If a woman knows nothing else, she should know how to be silent. . . . Do not question. Do not fight. Do not resist."" Such is eight-year-old Noriko ""Nori"" Kamiza's first lesson. She will not question why her mother abandoned her with only these final words. She will not fight her confinement to the attic of her grandparents' imperial estate. And she will not resist the scalding chemical baths she receives daily to lighten her shameful skin.<br /><br />The illegitimate child of a Japanese aristocrat and her African American GI lover, Nori is an outsider from birth. Though her grandparents take her in, they do so only to conceal her, fearful of a stain on the royal pedigree that they are desperate to uphold in a changing Japan. Obedient to a fault, Nori accepts her solitary life for what it is, despite her natural intellect and nagging curiosity about what lies outside the attic's walls. But when chance brings her legitimate older half-brother, Akira, to the estate that is his inheritance and destiny, Nori finds in him the first person who will allow her to question, and the siblings form an unlikely but powerful bond—a bond their formidable grandparents cannot allow and that will irrevocably change the lives they were always meant to lead. Because now that Nori has glimpsed a world in which perhaps there is a place for her after all, she is ready to fight to be a part of it—a battle that just might cost her everything.<br /><br />Spanning decades and continents, Fifty Words for Rain is a dazzling epic about the ties that bind, the ties that give you strength, and what it means to try to break free.",3.97,464,Hardcover, ,695,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49691870-fifty-words-for-rain,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49691870-fifty-words-for-rain

But she knew her man: a famously thoughtful and broad-minded player, he was intrigued by her pitch that she wasn't interested in making money so much as learning about life. She had faced a stretch of personal bad luck, and her reflections on the role of chance had led her to a giant of game theory, who pointed her to poker as the ultimate master class in learning to distinguish between what can be controlled and what can't. And she certainly brought something to the table, including a Ph.D. in psychology and an acclaimed and growing body of work on human behavior and how to hack it. So Seidel was in, and soon she was down the rabbit hole with him, into the wild, fiercely competitive, overwhelmingly masculine world of high-stakes Texas Hold'em, their initial end point the following year's World Series of Poker.<br /><br />But then something extraordinary happened. Under Seidel's guidance, Konnikova did have many epiphanies about life that derived from her new pursuit, including how to better read, not just her opponents but far more importantly herself; how to identify what tilted her into an emotional state that got in the way of good decisions; and how to get to a place where she could accept luck for what it was, and what it wasn't. But she also began to win. And win. In a little over a year, she began making earnest money from tournaments, ultimately totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. She won a major title, got a sponsor, and got used to being on television, and to headlines like ""How one writer's book deal turned her into a professional poker player."" She even learned to like Las Vegas.<br /><br />But in the end, Maria Konnikova is a writer and student of human behavior, and ultimately the point was to render her incredible journey into a container for its invaluable lessons. The biggest bluff of all, she learned, is that skill is enough. Bad cards will come our way, but keeping our focus on how we play them and not on the outcome will keep us moving through many a dark patch, until the luck once again breaks our way.",4.15,368,Hardcover, ,412,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49814228-the-biggest-bluff,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49814228-the-biggest-bluff

Her victim impact statement was posted on BuzzFeed, where it instantly went viral–viewed by eleven million people within four days, it was translated globally and read on the floor of Congress; it inspired changes in California law and the recall of the judge in the case.

</b>Anne Glenconner has been at the center of the royal circle from childhood, when she met and befriended the future Queen Elizabeth II and her sister, the Princess Margaret. Though the firstborn child of the 5th Earl of Leicester, who controlled one of the largest estates in England, as a daughter she was deemed ""the greatest disappointment"" and unable to inherit. Since then she has needed all her resilience to survive the vipers of court life with her sense of humor intact. <br /><br /><br />A unique witness to landmark moments in royal history, Maid of Honor at Queen Elizabeth's coronation, and a lady in waiting to Princess Margaret until her death in 2002, Anne's life has encompassed extraordinary drama and tragedy. In <i>Lady in Waiting</i>, she will share many intimate royal stories from her time as Princess Margaret's closest confidante as well as her own battle for survival: her broken-off first engagement on the basis of her ""mad blood""; her 54-year marriage to the volatile, unfaithful Colin Tennant, Lord Glenconner, who left his fortune to a former servant; the death in adulthood of two of her sons; a third son she nursed back from a six-month coma following a horrific motorcycle accident. Through it all, Anne has carried on, traveling the world with the royal family, including visiting the White House, and developing the Caribbean island of Mustique as a safe harbor for the rich and famous-hosting Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Raquel Welch, and many other politicians, aristocrats, and celebrities. <br />",4.09,326,Hardcover, ,911,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49945845-lady-in-waiting,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49945845-lady-in-waiting

And when she realizes that she must stand up not only for herself, but for other girls, for the ones who came before her and were lost, and for the next girls, who will inevitably follow; she finds the resolve to speak, however she can—in a whisper, in song, in broken English—until she is heard.",4.48,371,Kindle Edition, ,487,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50010188-the-girl-with-the-louding-voice,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50010188-the-girl-with-the-louding-voice

Twenty-year-old Maren Magnusdatter stands on the craggy coast, watching the sea break into a sudden and reckless storm. Forty fishermen, including her brother and father, are drowned and left broken on the rocks below. With the menfolk wiped out, the women of the tiny Arctic town of Vardø must fend for themselves. <br /><br />Three years later, a sinister figure arrives. Absalom Cornet comes from Scotland, where he burned witches in the northern isles. He brings with him his young Norwegian wife, Ursa, who is both heady with her husband's authority and terrified by it. In Vardø, and in Maren, Ursa sees something she has never seen before: independent women. But Absalom sees only a place untouched by God, and flooded with a mighty evil. <br /><br />As Maren and Ursa are drawn to one another in ways that surprise them both, the island begins to close in on them, with Absalom's iron rule threatening Vardø's very existence. <br /><br />Inspired by the real events of the Vardø storm and the 1621 witch trials, The Mercies is a story of love, evil, and obsession, set at the edge of civilization.",4.03,345,Kindle Edition, ,80,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50065605-the-mercies,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50065605-the-mercies

After World War II, Don's work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins—aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony—and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after another, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family?<br /><br /><br /> What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amid profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations.<br /><br /><br /> With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family's unforgettable legacy of suffering, love, and hope.",4.15,400,Hardcover, ,3198,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50088631-hidden-valley-road,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50088631-hidden-valley-road

</p><p>Bunny McGarry is a man on a mission. He left behind his life in Ireland to go to New York to find the woman he loves, who happens to have a lot of very dangerous people looking for her. The good news is that they don’t know where she is, the bad news is that Bunny doesn’t either and the only people that do are a rogue order of nuns called The Sisters of the Saint who have raised not being found to the level of art form.<br /></p><p>Bunny’s one clue is a priest he thinks might know something, but Father Gabriel de Marcos isn’t willing to play ball. The padre runs a boxing club at the bad end of the Bronx, battling to keep kids out of gangs – noble, thankless work. Thing is, saints don’t typically have assassins sent after them. What sins are hidden in this priest’s mysterious past? Bunny has no choice but to save Gabriel from the demons that are on his tail. He has to manage all this while living under the rules that chill him to the very bone. No drinking. No swearing. No violence.<br /></p><p>I Have Sinned is book two in the McGarry Stateside series, a continuation of the smash hit Dublin Trilogy which also featured Bunny McGarry.

She's on a plane when the flight attendant makes an announcement: prepare for a crash landing. She braces herself as thoughts flash through her mind. The shocking thing is, the thoughts are not of her husband, but a man she last saw fifteen years ago: Wyatt Armstrong.<br /><br />Dawn, miraculously, survives the crash, but so do all the doubts that have suddenly been raised. She has led a good life. Back in Boston, there is her husband, Brian, her beloved daughter, and her work as a death doula, where she helps ease the transition between life and death for patients in hospice.<br /><br />But somewhere in Egypt is Wyatt Armstrong, who works as an archaeologist unearthing ancient burial sites, a job she once studied for, but was forced to abandon when life suddenly intervened. And now, when it seems that fate is offering her second chances, she is not as sure of the choice she once made.<br /><br />After the crash landing, the airline ensures the survivors are seen by a doctor, then offers transportation wherever they want to go. The obvious option for Dawn is to continue down the path she is on and go home to her family. The other is to return to the archaeological site she left years before, reconnect with Wyatt and their unresolved history, and maybe even complete her research on The Book of Two Ways--the first known map of the afterlife. <br /><br />As the story unfolds, Dawn's two possible futures unspool side by side, as do the secrets and doubts long buried beside them.

Still, when detectives asked for victims to come forward, she sent a note.<br />Her criminal case file reopened, she saw for the first time evidence that corroborated her memories. Here were depictions of the naïve, hard-working girl she'd been, a chorister and debater, the daughter of a priest; of the two senior athletes who assaulted her and were allowed to graduate with awards; and of the faculty, doctors, and priests who had known about Crawford's assault and gone to great lengths to bury it.<br />Now a wife, mother, and writer living on the other side of the country, Crawford learned that police had uncovered astonishing proof of an institutional silencing years before, and that unnamed powers were still trying to block her case. The slander, innuendo, and lack of adult concern that Crawford had experienced as a student hadn't been imagined as the effects of trauma, after all: these were the actions of a school that prized its reputation above anything, even a child.<br />This revelation launched Crawford on an extraordinary inquiry into the ways gender, privilege, and power shaped her experience as a girl at the gates of America's elite. Her investigation looks beyond the sprawling playing fields and soaring chapel towers of crucibles of power like St. Paul's, whose reckoning is still to come. And it runs deep into the channels of shame and guilt, witness and silencing, that dictate who can speak and who is heard in American society.<br />An insightful, mature, beautifully written memoir, <i>Notes on a Silencing</i> is an arresting coming-of-age story that wrestles with an essential question for our time: what telling of a survivor's story will finally force a remedy?",4.29,400,Kindle Edition, ,37,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50268576-notes-on-a-silencing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50268576-notes-on-a-silencing

Her mail consists of wedding invitations and final notices from debt collectors. A former child golf prodigy, she now waits tables in Harvard Square and rents a tiny, moldy room at the side of a garage where she works on the novel she’s been writing for six years. At thirty-one, Casey is still clutching onto something nearly all her old friends have let go of: the determination to live a creative life. When she falls for two very different men at the same time, her world fractures even more. Casey’s fight to fulfill her creative ambitions and balance the conflicting demands of art and life is challenged in ways that push her to the brink.</p><br /><p></p><br /><p><i>Writers &amp; Lovers</i> follows Casey—a smart and achingly vulnerable protagonist—in the last days of a long youth, a time when every element of her life comes to a crisis. Written with King’s trademark humor, heart, and intelligence, <i>Writers &amp; Lovers</i> is a transfixing novel that explores the terrifying and exhilarating leap between the end of one phase of life and the beginning of another.</p>",4.09,320,Kindle Edition, ,542,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50395093-writers-lovers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50395093-writers-lovers

Flo and Clara, two impressionable students, are obsessed with each other and with a daring young writer named Mary MacLane, the author of a scandalous bestselling memoir. To show their devotion to Mary, the girls establish their own private club and call it The Plain Bad Heroine Society. They meet in secret in a nearby apple orchard, the setting of their wildest happiness and, ultimately, of their macabre deaths. This is where their bodies are later discovered with a copy of Mary’s book splayed beside them, the victims of a swarm of stinging, angry yellow jackets. Less than five years later, The Brookhants School for Girls closes its doors forever—but not before three more people mysteriously die on the property, each in a most troubling way. <br /><br />Over a century later, the now abandoned and crumbling Brookhants is back in the news when wunderkind writer, Merritt Emmons, publishes a breakout book celebrating the queer, feminist history surrounding the “haunted and cursed” Gilded-Age institution. Her bestselling book inspires a controversial horror film adaptation starring celebrity actor and lesbian it girl Harper Harper playing the ill-fated heroine Flo, opposite B-list actress and former child star Audrey Wells as Clara. But as Brookhants opens its gates once again, and our three modern heroines arrive on set to begin filming, past and present become grimly entangled—or perhaps just grimly exploited—and soon it’s impossible to tell where the curse leaves off and Hollywood begins. <br /><br />A story within a story within a story and featuring black-and-white period illustrations, <i>Plain Bad Heroines</i> is a devilishly haunting, modern masterwork of metafiction that manages to combine the ghostly sensibility of Sarah Waters with the dark imagination of Marisha Pessl and the sharp humor and incisive social commentary of Curtis Sittenfeld into one laugh-out-loud funny, spellbinding, and wonderfully luxuriant read.",3.75,619,Hardcover, ,689,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50496875-plain-bad-heroines,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50496875-plain-bad-heroines

It was an unexpected bestseller: more than 700,000 copies sold so far, 1,000+ 5-star reviews on Amazon (my favourite: ""I have plodded through many books that wish they could be this book""), a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and used by people and organizations around the world.<br /><br />So I've been sweating on the follow-up. The pressure! The anticipation! But here it is, and I think you're going to like it. If <i>The Coaching Habit</i> says, “here are the seven essential questions to be more coach-like,” <i>The Advice Trap</i> is about getting to grips with how to actually change your behaviour so you stay curious a little bit longer.<br /><br />It sounds like it should be easy, but it's not. You have to tame your Advice Monster, that part of you that jumps in to offer up ideas, opinions, suggestions and advice. And it's taming your Advice Monster that's at the heart of this book. But there are also some specific coaching strategies, particularly on how to focus on what matters most. There are tools to make your conversations, coaching and otherwise, irresistible. There are even resources beyond the book itself, including a one-year, free leadership program from a 52-person faculty of cool, diverse, and provocative thinkers.<br /><br />In 2019, I was named the #1 Thought Leader in Coaching, and was short-listed for the coaching award by Thinkers50, the “Oscars of Management.” My work's been featured in journals such as <i>HBR</i>, <i>Fast Company</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, and <i>Inc.</i>, and my company, Box of Crayons, has trained more than 100,000 people just like you in the tools and mindset required for this essential leadership behaviour: being more coach-like. You'll get all of that wisdom and experience when you read <i>The Advice Trap</i>. I'm pretty sure you'll find it a great investment of your money and time. (And, by the way, thank you in advance for buying it. I'm thrilled to know the book is going out into the world.)",4.25,267,Kindle Edition, ,7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50550775-the-advice-trap,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50550775-the-advice-trap

Ranging widely across the culture, from Harvey Weinstein and the Brett Kavanaugh hearings to ""Cat Person"" and the political misfortunes of Elizabeth Warren, Manne's book shows how privileged men's sense of entitlement - to sex, yes, but more insidiously to admiration, care, bodily autonomy, knowledge, and power - is a pervasive social problem with often devastating consequences.<br /><br />In clear, lucid prose, Manne argues that male entitlement can explain a wide array of phenomena, from mansplaining and the under-treatment of women's pain to mass shootings by incels and the seemingly intractable notion that women are ""unelectable."" Moreover, Manne implicates each of us in toxic masculinity: It's not just a product of a few bad actors; it's something we all perpetuate, conditioned as we are by the social and cultural mores of our time. The only way to combat it, she says, is to expose the flaws in our default modes of thought while enabling women to take up space, say their piece, and muster resistance to the entitled attitudes of the men around them.<br /><br />With wit and intellectual fierceness, Manne sheds new light on gender and power and offers a vision of a world in which women are just as entitled as men to our collective care and concern.",4.18,269,Kindle Edition, ,83,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50726976-entitled,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50726976-entitled

Living in that house.</em><br /><br />Maggie Holt is used to such questions. Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, moved into Baneberry Hall, a rambling Victorian estate in the Vermont woods. They spent three weeks there before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted in a nonfiction book called <em>House of Horrors</em>. His tale of ghostly happenings and encounters with malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon, rivaling <em>The Amityville Horror</em> in popularity—and skepticism.<br /><br />Today, Maggie is a restorer of old homes and too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father’s book. But she also doesn’t believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don’t exist. When Maggie inherits Baneberry Hall after her father’s death, she returns to renovate the place to prepare it for sale. But her homecoming is anything but warm. People from the past, chronicled in <em>House of Horrors</em>, lurk in the shadows. And locals aren’t thrilled that their small town has been made infamous thanks to Maggie’s father. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself—a place filled with relics from another era that hint at a history of dark deeds. As Maggie experiences strange occurrences straight out of her father’s book, she starts to believe that what he wrote was more fact than fiction.<br /><br /><b>In the latest thriller from <em>New York Times</em> bestseller Riley Sager, a woman returns to the house made famous by her father’s bestselling horror memoir.

As they navigate their way around Parliament, handling backroom deals, nepotistic party heads, and laws that seem to be tailor-made to benefit the ruling party, they learn that politics and idealism don't always go together. <br /><br />While Srikar tries to adapt to his new avatar and lie low, Raghav uses his Twitter alter ego, @Arnavinator, to vent his frustration and spread chaos. But when a new bill that threatens freedom of expression is bulldozed through with impunity, Srikar and Raghav must make a choice—to compromise on their values or to stand up for what is right. But at what cost? And can they and their unlikely allies—a jaded lawyer, an ambitious journalist and a rising YouTube star—really make a difference? <br /><br />A heady mix of politics, satire and current events, Parliamental is a roller-coaster ride through the corridors of power.",3.78,220,Paperback, ,37,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50936551-parliamental,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50936551-parliamental

A sports statistician, data journalist, and newly minted media celebrity who correctly forecasted every outcome of the 2008 election, Sam’s familiar with predicting the future. But when projection meets reality, things turn complicated. Sam’s editor sends him to profile disgraced political columnist Frank Doyle. To most readers, Doyle is a liberal lion turned neocon Iraq war apologist, but to Sam he is above all the author of the great works of baseball lore that sparked Sam’s childhood love of the game—books he now views as childish myth-making to be crushed with his empirical hammer. But Doyle proves something else in person: charming, intelligent, and more convincing than Sam could have expected. Then there is his daughter, Margo, to whom Sam becomes desperately attracted—just as his wife, Lucy, arrives from Wisconsin. The lives of these characters are entwined with those of the rest of the Doyle family—Frank’s wife, Kit, whose investment bank collapsed during the financial crisis; his son, Eddie, an Army veteran just returned from his second combat tour; and Eddie’s best childhood friend, hedge funder Justin Price. While the end of the world might not be arriving, Beha’s characters are each headed for apocalypses of their own making. ",4.06,520,Hardcover, ,82,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50970293-the-index-of-self-destructive-acts,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50970293-the-index-of-self-destructive-acts
