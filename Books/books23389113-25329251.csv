We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?<br /><br />Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?” <br /><br />But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.<br /><br />For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for <i>Modern Romance</i>, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before.<br /><br />In <i>Modern Romance</i>, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.",3.82,279,Hardcover, ,11378,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23453112-modern-romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23453112-modern-romance

This perspective leads to therapies focused on ridding individuals of autistic symptoms. In <i>Uniquely Human</i>, Dr. Barry M. Prizant suggests a major shift in understanding autism: Instead of classifying ""autistic"" behaviors as signs of pathology, he sees them as strategies to cope with a world that feels chaotic and overwhelming. Rather than curb these behaviors, it's better to enhance abilities, build on strengths, and offer supports that will naturally lead to more desirable behavior and a better quality of life. In fact, argues Dr. Prizant, attempts to eliminate autistic behaviors may actually interfere with important developmental processes.<br /><br />Including inspiring stories and practical advice drawn from Dr. Prizant's four-decade career working in universities, schools, hospitals, and in private practice, <i>Uniquely Human</i> offers a compassionate and insightful perspective that parents, professionals, and family members will find uplifting and hopeful.",4.45,256,Hardcover, ,212,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492643-uniquely-human,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492643-uniquely-human

Drawing on her background in anthropology and primatology, she tried looking at her new world through that lens, and suddenly things fell into place. She understood the other mothers' snobbiness at school drop-off when she compared them to olive baboons. Her obsessional quest for a Hermes Birkin handbag made sense when she realized other females wielded them to establish dominance in their troop. And so she analyzed tribal migration patterns, display rituals, physical adornment, mutilation, mating practices, extra-pair copulation, and more. Her conclusions are smart, thought-provoking, and hilariously unexpected.<br /><br />Every city has its Upper East Side, and in Wednesday's memoir, readers everywhere will recognize the strange cultural codes of powerful social hierarchies and the compelling desire to climb them. They will also see that Upper East Side mothers want the same things for their children that all mothers want: safety, happiness, and success;and not even sky-high penthouses and chauffeured SUVs can protect this ecologically released tribe from the universal experiences of anxiety and loss.

This decisive battle had far-reaching repercussions in Canada, the United States, England, and Ghent, Belgium, where peace talks were under way. Examining the naval and land campaign in strategic, political, and military terms, from planning to execution to outcome, <i>The Battle of Lake Champlain </i>offers the most thorough account written of this pivotal moment in American history.<br /><br /> For decades the Champlain corridor—a direct and accessible invasion route between Lower Canada and the northern United States—had been hotly contested in wars for control of the region. In exploring the crucial issue of why it took two years for the United States and Britain to confront each other on Lake Champlain, historian John H. Schroeder recounts the war’s early years, the failed U.S. invasions of Canada in 1812 and 1813, and the ensuing naval race for control of the lake in 1814. To explain how the Americans achieved their unexpected victory, Schroeder weighs the effects on both sides of preparations and planning, personal valor and cowardice, command decisions both brilliant and ill-conceived, and sheer luck both good and bad.<br /><br /> Previous histories have claimed that the War of 1812 ended with Andrew Jackson’s victory at the Battle of New Orleans. Schroeder demonstrates that the United States really won the war four months before—at Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain. Through a comprehensive analysis of politics and diplomacy, Schroeder shows that the victory at Lake Champlain prompted the British to moderate their demands at Ghent, bringing the war directly and swiftly to an end before Jackson’s spectacular victory in January 1815.",4.75,184,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23494026-the-battle-of-lake-champlain,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23494026-the-battle-of-lake-champlain

Yet we too often lose sight of the fact that vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy, belonging, creativity, authenticity, and love.” On The Power of Vulnerability, Dr. Brown offers an invitation and a promise - that when we dare to drop the armor that protects us from feeling vulnerable, we open ourselves to the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Here she dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and reveals that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.<br />“The Power of Vulnerability is a very personal project for me,” Brené explains. “This is the first place that all of my work comes together. This audio course draws from all three of my books - it’s the culmination of everything I’ve learned over the past twelve years. I'm very excited to weave it all into a truly comprehensive form that shows what these findings and insights can mean in our lives.”<br /><br /><b>Guidance and Insights for Wholehearted Living</b><br /><br />Over the past twelve years, Dr. Brené Brown has interviewed hundreds of people as part of an ongoing study of vulnerability. “The research shows that we try to ward disappointment with a shield of cynicism, disarm shame by numbing ourselves against joy, and circumvent grief by shutting off our willingness to love,” explains Dr. Brown. When we become aware of these patterns, she teaches, we begin to become conscious of how much we sacrifice in the name of self-defense -and how much richer our lives become when we open ourselves to vulnerability.<br />“In my research,” Dr. Brown says, “the word I use to describe people who can live from a place of vulnerability is wholehearted.” Being wholehearted is a practice—one that we can choose to cultivate through empathy, gratitude, and awareness of our vulnerability armor. Join this engaging and heartfelt teacher on The Power of Vulnerability as she offers profound insights on leaning into the full spectrum of emotions—so we can show up, let ourselves be seen, and truly be all in.<br /><br /><b>HIGHLIGHTS</b><br /><br />Cultivating shame resilience—the key to developing a sense of worth and belonging.<br />Vulnerability as the origin point for innovation, adaptability, accountability, and visionary leadership.<br />Our emotional armory - how we use perfectionism, numbing, and other tactics to avoid feeling vulnerable.<br />The myths of vulnerability - common misconceptions about weakness, trust, and self-sufficiency.<br />Discovering your vulnerability armor - recognizing what makes us shut down, and how we can change.<br />The 10 guideposts of wholehearted living - essential skills for becoming fully engaged in life.<br />Six hours of stories, warm humor, and transformative insights for living a life of courage, authenticity, and compassion from Dr. Brené Brown.",4.63,1,Audible Audio, ,1314,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23500254-the-power-of-vulnerability,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23500254-the-power-of-vulnerability

Braeden and Serafina must uncover the Man in the Black Cloak’s true identity... before all of the children vanish one by one.<br /><br />Serafina’s hunt leads her into the very forest that she has been taught to fear. There she discovers a forgotten legacy of magic, one that is bound to her own identity. In order to save the children of Biltmore, Serafina must seek the answers that will unlock the puzzle of her past.",3.86,293,Hardcover, ,3325,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23507745-serafina-and-the-black-cloak,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23507745-serafina-and-the-black-cloak

A war is raging between the vampire forces of the Red Court and the White Council - a war that the wizards are losing. So desperate are the Council that they've dragooned the experienced and the outcast to reinforce their thinning ranks of Wardens. One of these draftees is one Harry Dresden, Chicago's only wizard-for-hire and a guy who's long been looked upon with suspicion by the supernatural authorities. Now, he's one of them, and his first big mission as a Warden is a doozy: take a small team of greenhorns to a frigid town in the middle of nowhere to rescue a handful of mortals who've been targeted by the Red Court. The question is, why exactly are these particular mortals so crucial to the outcome of the war? The answer will come only if Harry can keep them, and his team, alive for one very long night. <br /> This graphic novel collects the critically acclaimed five-issue series in one volume, and features a bonus section with Jim Butcher's original story outline, sketchbook artwork from Carlos Gomez, cover gallery with roughs from Stjepan Sejic, and more! <br />",4.14,136,Kindle Edition, ,21,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23507765-war-cry,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23507765-war-cry

So bad-boy rock icon Zander Freedman couldn’t possibly tempt her to write his memoir. Except the man is a mass of fascinating contradictions–manipulative, honest, gifted, charismatic and morally ambiguous. In short, everything she seeks in a biography subject. When in her life will she get another chance to work with a living legend? But saying yes to one temptation soon leads to another. Suddenly she’s having heated fantasies about her subject, fantasies this blue-eyed devil is only too willing to stoke. She thought self-control was in her DNA; after all, she grew up a minister’s daughter. She thought wrong. <br /><br />Rock star Zander Freedman has been an outlier–many would say an outcast–for most of his life. But there’s no disaster he can’t overcome, from the breakup of his band to the inevitable damage to his reputation. His Resurrection Tour is shaping up to be his greatest triumph–if his golden voice holds out. Contracting a respected biographer is simply about creating more buzz. Elizabeth’s integrity is the key to consolidating his legacy as one of rock’s greats. All the damn woman has to do is write down what he tells her. Not force him to think. Or encourage the good guy struggling to get out. And certainly not make him fall in love for the first time in his life.

Documentary-quality photo essays reveal the local Japanese communities that support these long-established preservation practices. It is by Nancy Singleton Hachisu, author of <i>Japanese Farm Food</i>.<br /><br /><i>Preserving the Japanese Way: Traditions of Salting, Fermenting, and Pickling for the Modern Kitchen</i> offers a clear road map for preserving fruits, vegetables, and fish through a nonscientific, farm- or fisherman-centric approach. An essential backdrop to the 125 recipes outlined in this book are the producers and the artisanal products used to make these salted and fermented foods. The more than 350 arresting photos of the barrel maker, fish sauce producer, artisanal vinegar company, 200 hundred-year-old sake producer, and traditional morning pickle markets with local grandmas still selling their wares document an authentic view of the inner circle of Japanese life. Recipe methods range from the ultratraditional— <i>Umeboshi</i> (Salted Sour Plums), <i>Takuan</i> (Half-Dried Daikon Pickled in Rice Bran), and <i>Hakusai </i>(Fermented Napa Cabbage)— to the modern: Zucchini Pickled in Shoyu Koji, Turnips Pickled with Sour Plums, and Small Melons in Sake Lees. <i>Preserving the Japanese Way </i>also introduces and demystifies one of the most fascinating ingredients to hit the food scene in a decade: koji. Koji is neither new nor unusual in the landscape of Japan fermentation, but it has become a cult favorite for quick pickling or marinades. <i>Preserving the Japanese Way</i> is a book about community, seasonality as the root of preserved food, and ultimately about why both are relevant in our lives today.<br /><br /> “In Japan, pickling, fermenting, and salting are elevated as a delicious and refined art form, one that Nancy Singleton Hachisu has mastered.  This is a gorgeous, thoughtful—dare I say spiritual—guide to the world of Japanese pickling written with clarity and a deep respect for technique and tradition. Nancy understands that salting cherry blossoms and drying squid aren’t just about preserving foods—it's about preserving a way of life.”<br /> —Rick Bayless, author of <i>Authentic Mexican</i> and owner of Frontera Grill<br />  <br /> “In her first gorgeous book, Nancy delved into the soul of Japanese country cooking.  In this stunning new volume, we are introduced to the myriad ways of preserving and fermenting that, like the writing and photography, highlight the gentle elegance and beautiful patience of Japanese cookery.”<br />   —Edward Lee, author of <i>Smoke &amp; Pickles</i> and owner of 610 Magnolia<br />  <br /> “Even if you never yearned to make your own miso or pickle your own vegetables, this beautiful book will change your mind. It’s almost impossible to flip through these pages without wanting to join Nancy Singleton Hachisu in the lovely meditation of her cooking. This book is unlike anything else out there, and every serious cook will want to own it.”<br /> —Ruth Reichl, author of <i>Tender at the Bone</i> and former editor-in-chief of <i>Gourmet Magazine</i>",4.13,400,Hardcover, ,20,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23604443-preserving-the-japanese-way,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23604443-preserving-the-japanese-way

It is not in a body that flesh appears originally, but being in the flesh that comes first. For only in flesh can one see or touch, feel joy or sorrow, hunger or thirst--and undergo each of these impressions as one's own. But how does flesh come into this condition? How is life given to it so that it can feel itself, or anything else, in this way? Christianity's fundamental thesis, on which its fate plays out in every generation, is that ""the Word was made flesh."" Henry then asks what revelation must be for it to be accomplished as flesh, and what flesh must be to be revelation.

Scientists have long supported this assumption by claiming that emotions are hardwired in the body or the brain. Today, however, the science of emotion is in the midst of a revolution on par with the discovery of relativity in physics and natural selection in biology—ans this paradigm shift has far-reaching implications for us all.<br /><br />Leading the charge is psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, whose theory of emotion is driving a deeper understanding of the mind and brain, and shedding new light on what it means to be human. Her research overturns the widely held belief that emotions are housed in different parts of the brain and are universally expressed and recognized. Instead, she has shown that emotion is constructed in the moment, by core systems that interact across the whole brain, aided by a lifetime of learning. This new theory means that you play a much greater role in your emotional life than you ever thought. Its repercussions are already shaking the foundations not only of psychology but also of medicine, the legal system, child-rearing, meditation, and even airport security.<br /><br />Why do emotions feel automatic? Does rational thought really control emotion? How does emotion affect disease?

Ever since, the press has pursued her as the lone surviving “Black-Eyed Susan,” the nickname given to the murder victims because of the yellow carpet of wildflowers that flourished above their shared grave. Tessa’s testimony about those tragic hours put a man on death row.<br />  <br /> Now, almost two decades later, Tessa is an artist and single mother. In the desolate cold of February, she is shocked to discover a freshly planted patch of black-eyed susans—a summertime bloom—just outside her bedroom window. Terrified at the implications—that she sent the wrong man to prison and the real killer remains at large—Tessa turns to the lawyers working to exonerate the man awaiting execution. But the flowers alone are not proof enough, and the forensic investigation of the still-unidentified bones is progressing too slowly. An innocent life hangs in the balance. The legal team appeals to Tessa to undergo hypnosis to retrieve lost memories—and to share the drawings she produced as part of an experimental therapy shortly after her rescue.<br />  <br /> What they don’t know is that Tessa and the scared, fragile girl she was have built a  fortress of secrets. As the clock ticks toward the execution, Tessa fears for her sanity, but even more for the safety of her teenaged daughter. Is a serial killer still roaming free, taunting Tessa with a trail of clues? She has no choice but to confront old ghosts and lingering nightmares to finally discover what really happened that night.<br />  <br /> Shocking, intense, and utterly original, <i>Black-Eyed Susans</i> is a dazzling psychological thriller, seamlessly weaving past and present in a searing tale of a young woman whose harrowing memories remain in a field of flowers—as a killer makes a chilling return to his garden.",3.78,354,Hardcover, ,2555,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23746004-black-eyed-susans,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23746004-black-eyed-susans

But she doesn't have a clue who her father is, why her mother chose to live as a recluse with an invented name, or how she'll ever have a normal life. <br /><br />Enter the Germans.

And yet, as master coach Marcia Reynolds discovered, many of them are also anxious, discontented, and frustrated. They’re constantly questioning their purpose, juggling multiple roles, and reevaluating their goals. As a result they’re restless—they move from job to job, from challenge to challenge, almost on impulse. They’re wander women.<br />Existing personal growth books, so focused on empowerment and encouragement, can’t help these women. They don’t need to find their voice—they know how to roar. They don’t expect balance in their lives—but they long to find peace in the chaos. They aren’t necessarily focused on gaining a seat in the boardroom—they want projects that mean something or businesses they run on their own.<br />Reynolds helps wander women understand the roots of their restlessness and make their wandering a conscious strategy, not a reaction. Drawing on extensive research and interviews she illuminates the needs that drive their decisions and the core assumptions that lock them into rigid perfectionist patterns. She offers a wealth of exercises and practices that will enable wander women to reset their mental programming, discover new ways of finding direction, and thoughtfully choose and plan their futures, whether they climb the corporate ladder, find satisfaction below the glass ceiling, or set out on their own.<br />For every woman plagued by frustration and self-doubt—“Will what I’ve done ever feel good enough?”—Wander Woman sets the stage to uncover the answers to life’s tough questions about meaning and purpose, significance and value, and the legacy you can leave from a life lived well.",3.53,235,Kindle Edition, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23793212-wander-woman,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23793212-wander-woman

He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like “guilt,” “sin,” and “redemption”) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong.

Things could have turned out very differently, so it is natural to wonder what would have happened if certain events had never occurred or happened in a different way. <i>What If?</i> is the thought-provoking, enjoyable and insightful book that explores this conceit as its starting point, asking of key events in twentieth-century Ireland: ‘what if?’ <br /><br />Based on Diarmaid Ferriter’s acclaimed RTÉ Radio One series, the book looks at twenty events in twentieth-century Ireland, each of which was discussed on Ferriter’s show with two experts, and speculates on how things might have developed had circumstances been different. In doing so, Ferriter also sheds much new light on what actually did happen, how Ireland changed during the course of the twentieth century and the experiences of those who lived through it. <br /><br />The big questions are tackled: what if there had been no 1916 Rising? What if Ireland had been invaded during World War II? What if there had been no programmes for economic expansion? What if Mary Robinson had not been elected president in 1990? <br /><br />But the book also poses other, less obvious, questions: what if James Joyce and Samuel Beckett had stayed in Ireland; if Britain had blocked Irish immigration in the 1950s; if there had been no <i>Late Late Show</i> or <i>Magill</i> magazine; if Bishop Eamon Casey had never met Annie Murphy; or if John Charles McQuaid had never been Archbishop of Dublin?</p> <i>What If?

Sadly, the Perkins don’t care if Lydia makes a suitable match. All her mother’s hopes lie in the beautiful but vapid Kitty, and Lydia is expected to answer her every whim. In an effort to mix with the ton, the sisters find themselves at St. Barnabas Church, gawking at the soldiers wounded at the Battle of Toulouse, the final battle that sent Napoleon into exile at Elba. Kitty faints prettily and is revived by a pair of admiring dandies, but Lydia is drawn to the suffering of the men. Among them is Major Sam Reed, grievously wounded himself, but in fact an earl: Lord Laren of Laren Hall, Northumberland. Major Reed could be recovering in comfort, but instead he chooses to stand by his men. Despite her parents’ objections, Lydia returns to nurse the soldiers. As she learns the joy of being useful, she and Major Reed become friends. Finally he makes a curious proposal: Would she marry him, be his wife in name only, and travel with him to Northumberland? During the war, he invented a wife to appease his rich aunt. If he doesn’t produce “Delightful Saunders” in the flesh, he stands to lose his fortune. Can Lydia leave her indifferent family and embark on her first real adventure? She discovers that not every adventure is a pleasant one, as she falls in love with a man who might see her as merely a means to an end.

The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen has largely been omitted from history. Now, for the first time, acclaimed historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz offers a history of the United States told from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the US empire.<br /><br />With growing support for movements such as the campaign to abolish Columbus Day and replace it with Indigenous Peoples’ Day and the Dakota Access Pipeline protest led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, <em>An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States</em> is an essential resource providing historical threads that are crucial for understanding the present. In An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States, Dunbar-Ortiz adroitly challenges the founding myth of the United States and shows how policy against the Indigenous peoples was colonialist and designed to seize the territories of the original inhabitants, displacing or eliminating them. And as Dunbar-Ortiz reveals, this policy was praised in popular culture, through writers like James Fenimore Cooper and Walt Whitman, and in the highest offices of government and the military. Shockingly, as the genocidal policy reached its zenith under President Andrew Jackson, its ruthlessness was best articulated by US Army general Thomas S. Jesup, who, in 1836, wrote of the Seminoles: “The country can be rid of them only by exterminating them.” <br /> <br />Spanning more than four hundred years, this classic bottom-up peoples’ history radically reframes US history and explodes the silences that have haunted our national narrative.<br /><br /><em>An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States</em> is a 2015 PEN Oakland-Josephine Miles Award for Excellence in Literature.",4.36,296,Paperback, ,53,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995387-an-indigenous-peoples-history-of-the-united-states,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995387-an-indigenous-peoples-history-of-the-united-states

  <b>A brilliant, haunting, and profoundly original portrait of the defining tragedy of our time.</b>
</i><br /><br />In this epic history of extermination and survival, Timothy Snyder presents a new explanation of the great atrocity of the twentieth century, and reveals the risks that we face in the twenty-first. Based on new sources from eastern Europe and forgotten testimonies from Jewish survivors, <i>Black Earth</i> recounts the mass murder of the Jews as an event that is still close to us, more comprehensible than we would like to think, and thus all the more terrifying.<br /><br />The Holocaust began in a dark but accessible place, in Hitler's mind, with the thought that the elimination of Jews would restore balance to the planet and allow Germans to win the resources they desperately needed. Such a worldview could be realized only if Germany destroyed other states, so Hitler's aim was a colonial war in Europe itself. In the zones of statelessness, almost all Jews died. A few people, the righteous few, aided them, without support from institutions. Much of the new research in this book is devoted to understanding these extraordinary individuals. The almost insurmountable difficulties they faced only confirm the dangers of state destruction and ecological panic. These men and women should be emulated, but in similar circumstances few of us would do so.  <br /><br />By overlooking the lessons of the Holocaust, Snyder concludes, we have misunderstood modernity and endangered the future. The early twenty-first century is coming to resemble the early twentieth, as growing preoccupations with food and water accompany ideological challenges to global order. Our world is closer to Hitler's than we like to admit, and saving it requires us to see the Holocaust as it was -- and ourselves as we are.  Groundbreaking, authoritative, and utterly absorbing, <i>Black Earth</i> reveals a Holocaust that is not only history but warning.",4.25,462,Hardcover, ,349,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995415-black-earth,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995415-black-earth

En mi modesto entender, sólo hay dos explicaciones posibles para que llegara a ser publicada como un libro infantil: la primera, una suprema estupidez, altamente contagiosa, que hubiera impedido comprender la obvia connotación sarcástica de obra, y que se trasmitió a millones de lectores (o que una sociedad igualmente estúpida, admitió como válida); la segunda, la malevolencia y la falta de escrúpulos en su ánimo de lucro, de cierto editor, oculto en el anonimato, que publicó en 1884 la versión en castellano de la obra, bajo el título de “Viajes de Gulliver a los países remotos”, y que fue la base y referencia de la mayoría de las ediciones posteriores. <br />Es posible que el lector se pregunte: ¿por qué culpo al editor y no al traductor? El caso es que en la referida edición, el único nombre que aparece (además del de Jonathan Swift) es el del ilustrador Francisco Gómez Soler, mientras que el traductor tuvo el pudor de ocultarse tras las iniciales L.G.M., lo que lleva a suponer cierta “vergüenza” por haber traicionado los designios de propio autor de la obra. Además, se me hace imposible concebir que, en una traducción bien hecha en su mayor parte, el propio traductor haya mutilado fragmentos y párrafos completos por la simple mención de las palabras “heces”, “excremento”, “orina” o “prostituta”; lo que me inclina a pensar que se trata de una condición patológica de un editor cropofóbico y pseudomoralista...

Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, palaeontology, and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors?

However, few today know how to create 3D models, much less use their printer. <br /><br />Currently, understanding and utilizing the technology to design and manufacture products (as opposed to ""things"") still proves to be difficult for a myriad of reasons. Like any growing innovative technology, as the quality, speed and costs are optimized, the adoption rate and potential uses start to flourish. 3D Printing is a rising technology that will soon disrupt many industries across the economic spectrum.<br /><br /> Democracy Of Manufacturing <br /><br />3D Printing is dubbed the ""Democracy of Manufacturing"". Imagine. Anyone can design and create anything for anyone, anywhere. The democratization of media through self-publishing tools has spawned an age where everyone can easily produce and publish as an artist, producer, director or writer. Well, with the Internet &amp; 3D printing the same is soon to change for objects. Before long people will be able to design, print and sell products from the comfort of their own homes. <br /><br />Despite all the hype for 3D printing, the true potential of a 3D printing ""Factory-On-Demand"" is still often overlooked. There are many books out there that teach you how to create 3D printed objects. However, so far there has been no guide on how to turn 3D printing into a business. This book fills this gap by being the first guide on how to monetize your 3D printing skills. In addition to describing the technology in detail, it walks you through all the practical steps of turning your 3D printing skills into a business. The book will benefit both complete beginners and those more advanced in 3D printing technology.<br /><br /><b>Build Something From Nothing</b><br /><br />This handbook includes practical advice such as the list of the best software and hardware on the market today, discusses environmental advantages of 3D printing as well as the advantages of a shared economy, recent trends in the field of 3D printing, and makes predictions for the development of the field in the future. Moreover, it gives advice on how best to approach marketing, where to find ideas and inspiration, and how best to juggle various practical tasks that every new entrepreneur inevitably has to deal with.<br /><br />The book also gives advice on investing in 3D companies and teaching others how to use 3D printing for good.<br /><br /> Features <br />• Seven Ways to Monetize Your 3D Printer <br />• 2015 3D Printer Buyer’s Guide <br />• Movies &amp; TV episodes about 3D printing<br />• 3D CAD Modeling Software Guide <br />• List of Specialty CAD Software <br />• Places to outsource 3D design work<br />• 3D Scanner &amp; Applications Guide <br />• 3D Digital Marketplaces<br />• List of successfully funded 3D printers on kickstarter <br />• 3D Printing Stocks <br /><br /><b>

We’re a little taller or shorter than the average, our salary is a bit higher or lower than the average, and we wonder about who it is that is buying the average-priced home. All around us, we think, are the average people—with the average height, the average salary and the average house.<br /><br />But the average doesn’t just influence how we see ourselves—our entire social system has been built around this average-size-fits-all model. Schools are designed for the average student. Healthcare is designed for the average patient. Employers try to fill average job descriptions with employees on an average career trajectory. Our government implements programs and initiatives to serve the average person. For more than a century, we’ve believed that the best way to run our institutions is by focusing on the average person. But when you actually drill down into the numbers, you find an amazing fact: no one is average—which means that our society built for everyone is actually serving no one.<br /><br />In the 1950s, the American Air Force found itself with a massive problem—performance in expensive, custom-made planes was suffering terribly, with crashes peaking at seventeen in a single day. Since the state-of-the-art planes they were flying had been meticulously crafted to fit the average pilot, pilot error was assumed to be at fault. Until, that is, the Air Force investigated just how many of their pilots were actually average. The shocking answer: out of thousands of active-duty pilots, exactly zero were average. Not one. This discovery led to simple solutions (like adjustable seats) that dramatically reduced accidents, improved performance, and expanded the pool of potential pilots.

</p><p>Sugar Legowski-Gracia wasn’t always fat, but fat is what she is now at age seventeen. Not as fat as her mama, who is so big she hasn’t gotten out of bed in months. Not as heavy as her brother, Skunk, who has more meanness in him than fat, which is saying something. But she’s large enough to be the object of ridicule wherever she is: at the grocery store, walking down the street, at school. Sugar’s life is dictated by taking care of Mama in their run-down home—cooking, shopping, and, well, eating. A lot of eating, which Sugar hates as much as she loves.</p><p>When Sugar meets Even (not Evan—his nearly illiterate father misspelled his name on the birth certificate), she has the new experience of someone seeing <i>her</i> and not her body. As their unlikely friendship builds, Sugar allows herself to think about the future for the first time, a future not weighed down by her body or her mother.</p><p>Soon Sugar will have to decide whether to become the girl that Even helps her see within herself or to sink into the darkness of the skin-deep role her family and her life have created for her.</p>",3.94,276,Paperback, ,669,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24202275-sugar,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24202275-sugar

Poco antes, el 25 del mismo mes, el vencedor del Tour de Francia del año anterior, René Pottier, se había suicidado después de que su mujer le abandonara y se fugara con su amante. La apasionante historia del <strong>Tour de Francia</strong> ha estado jalonada desde sus inicios, en <strong>1903</strong>, por episodios de leyenda, escapadas épicas, victorias agónicas, accidentes brutales y triunfos gloriosos. El primer Tour fue ganado por un pequeño deshollinador que repetiría triunfo al año siguiente pero que sería descalificado. <br /><br />Fue en <strong>1904</strong> cuando apareció en la prueba el primer villano de la historia del ciclismo, un italiano con un peculiar sentido de la deportividad, una edición en la que hubo peleas, pedradas y hasta disparos. En <strong>1905</strong> la prueba transcurrió con algo más de tranquilidad y fue ganada por un empedernido jugador de cartas y dados que se hizo rico vendiendo flores. En <strong>1907</strong> aparece uno de los grandes sufridores de la bicicleta y uno de los personajes más curiosos de la historia del Tour: un adinerado ciclista que contrató a dos profesionales para que le ayudaran en la carrera mientras disfrutaban de los mejores restaurantes y hoteles a lo largo del recorrido.",3.64,312,Kindle Edition, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24266579-los-a-os-heroicos-del-tour-de-francia,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24266579-los-a-os-heroicos-del-tour-de-francia

But everything, including Paula's birthname Kali Jai, changed when she told a story of her own - one that landed Kai in prison and Paula in foster care. Separated, each holding her own secrets, the intense bond they once shared was fractured. <br /><br />These days, Paula has reincarnated herself as a tough-as-nails divorce attorney with a successful practice in Atlanta.

The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the <i>Lusitania</i> was one of the era’s great transatlantic “Greyhounds”—the fastest liner then in service—and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. <br /><br />Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of <i>Unterseeboot</i>-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger’s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the <i>Lusitania</i> made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small—hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more—all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.<br /><br /> It is a story that many of us think we know but don’t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, <i>Dead Wake</i> brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. <br /><br /> Gripping and important, <i>Dead Wake</i> captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.",4.09,450,Kindle Edition, ,611,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24356669-dead-wake,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24356669-dead-wake

  <b>From the bestselling author of <i>The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</i> comes<i> </i>an exquisite love story about Queenie Hennessy, the remarkable friend who inspired Harold’s cross-country journey.</b>
  <br />
</b><br />A runaway international bestseller, <i>The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry</i> followed its unassuming hero on an incredible journey as he traveled the length of England on foot—a journey spurred by a simple letter from his old friend Queenie Hennessy, writing from a hospice to say goodbye. Harold believed that as long as he kept walking, Queenie would live. What he didn’t know was that his decision to walk had caused her both alarm and fear. How could she wait? What would she say? Forced to confront the past, Queenie realizes she must write again.<br />  <br /> In this poignant parallel story to Harold’s saga, acclaimed author Rachel Joyce brings Queenie Hennessy’s voice into sharp focus. Setting pen to paper, Queenie makes a journey of her own, a journey that is even bigger than Harold’s; one word after another, she promises to confess long-buried truths—about her modest childhood, her studies at Oxford, the heartbreak that brought her to Kingsbridge and to loving Harold, her friendship with his son, the solace she has found in a garden by the sea. And, finally, the devastating secret she has kept from Harold for all these years.<br />  <br /> A wise, tender, layered novel that gathers tremendous emotional force, <i>The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy </i>underscores the resilience of the human spirit, beautifully illuminating the small yet pivotal moments that can change a person’s life.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>The Love Song of Miss Queenie Hennessy</i></b><br /> <b> </b><br /> “If you enjoyed Harold’s odyssey, you will adore this book. A page into this tender tale and it is clearly the perfect companion piece to the original story of Harold Fry. . . . Rachel Joyce fleshes out the joyous woman who inspired his epic journey.”<b>—<i>Daily Express</i></b><br /> <i> </i><br /> “A beautiful story which will grip you, make you laugh and cry, uplift your spirit and leave you feeling profoundly grateful and changed by the reading experience . . . a wonderful book about loss, redemption and joy.”<b>—<i>Daily Mail</i></b><br /> <i> </i><br /> “Touching . . .

Regardless, as the two move further away from the realm of friendship and deeper into the intoxicating world of S&amp;M, the bonds between them grow even tighter, but a secret from Ally's past threatens to tear them further apart.<br /><br />At the heat of every relationship lies unspoken truths, but for Ally and Lisa, the lines between love and lust, friendship and heartache, constantly blur.

Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life. It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.<br />  <br /> So if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: <i>How do we change our habits</i>?<br />  <br /> <i>Better than Before</i> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits—and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin’s compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <i>Better than Before</i> explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation. <br />  <br /> Along the way, Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers readers’ most pressing questions—oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore: <br /><br />• Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I <i>love</i> to do? <br />• Sometimes I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can’t change a habit, no matter how hard I try. Why? <br />• How quickly can I change a habit? <br />• What can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit? <br />• How can I help someone else change a habit? <br />• Why can I keep habits that benefit others, but can’t make habits that are just for me? <br /><br /> Whether readers want to get more sleep, stop checking their devices, maintain a healthy weight, or finish an important project, habits make change possible. Reading just a few chapters of <i>Better Than Before</i> will make readers eager to start work on their own habits—even before they’ve finished the book.",3.84,320,Kindle Edition, ,131,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24366759-better-than-before,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24366759-better-than-before

Hackers can activate baby monitors to spy on families, thieves are analyzing social media posts to plot home invasions, and stalkers are exploiting the GPS on smart phones to track their victims’ every move. We all know today’s criminals can steal identities, drain online bank accounts, and wipe out computer servers, but that’s just the beginning. To date, no computer has been created that could not be hacked—a sobering fact given our radical dependence on these machines for everything from our nation’s power grid to air traffic control to financial services. <br />     Yet, as ubiquitous as technology seems today, just over the horizon is a tidal wave of scientific progress that will leave our heads spinning. If today’s Internet is the size of a golf ball, tomorrow’s will be the size of the sun. Welcome to the Internet of Things, a living, breathing, global information grid where every physical object will be online. But with greater connections come greater risks. Implantable medical devices such as pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt of electricity and a car’s brakes can be disabled at high speed from miles away. Meanwhile, 3-D printers can produce AK-47s, bioterrorists can download the recipe for Spanish flu, and cartels are using fleets of drones to ferry drugs across borders.<br />     With explosive insights based upon a career in law enforcement and counterterrorism, Marc Goodman takes readers on a vivid journey through the darkest recesses of the Internet. Reading like science fiction, but based in science fact, <i>Future Crimes</i> explores how bad actors are primed to hijack the technologies of tomorrow, including robotics, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. These fields hold the power to create a world of unprecedented abundance and prosperity. But the technological bedrock upon which we are building our common future is deeply unstable and, like a house of cards, can come crashing down at any moment.<br /><i>     Future Crimes</i> provides a mind-blowing glimpse into the dark side of technological innovation and the unintended consequences of our connected world. Goodman offers a way out with clear steps we must take to survive the progress unfolding before us. Provocative, thrilling, and ultimately empowering, <i>Future Crimes</i> will serve as an urgent call to action that shows how we can take back control over our own devices and harness technology’s tremendous power for the betterment of humanity—before it’s too late.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.93,464,Kindle Edition, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24369277-future-crimes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24369277-future-crimes

On the eve of this centenary, journalist Johann Hari set off on an epic three-year, thirty-thousand-mile journey into the war on drugs. What he found is that more and more people all over the world have begun to recognize three startling truths: drugs are not what we think they are, addiction is not what we think it is, and the drug war has very different motives to the ones we have seen on our TV screens for so long.<br /> <br />In <i>Chasing the Scream</i>, Hari reveals his discoveries entirely through the stories of people across the world whose lives have been transformed by this war. They range from a transsexual crack dealer in Brooklyn searching for her mother to a teenage hit-man in Mexico searching for a way out. It begins with Hari's discovery that at the birth of the drug war, Billie Holiday was stalked and killed by the man who launched this crusade--and it ends with the story of a brave doctor who has led his country to decriminalize every drug, from cannabis to crack, with remarkable results.<i>

  <b>The #1 New York Times bestselling biography of how Steve Jobs became the most visionary CEO in history.  </b>
  <br />
</b><br /> <i>Becoming Steve Jobs</i> breaks down the conventional, one-dimensional view of Steve Jobs that he was half-genius, half-jerk from youth, an irascible and selfish leader who slighted friends and family alike. Becoming Steve Jobs<i> </i>answers the central question about the life and career of the Apple cofounder and CEO: How did a young man so reckless and arrogant that he was exiled from the company he founded become the most effective visionary business leader of our time, ultimately transforming the daily life of billions of people?<br /><br /> Drawing on incredible and sometimes exclusive access, Schlender and Tetzeli tell a different story of a real human being who wrestled with his failings and learned to maximize his strengths over time. Their rich, compelling narrative is filled with stories never told before from the people who knew Jobs best, including his family, former inner circle executives, and top people at Apple, Pixar and Disney, most notably Tim Cook, Jony Ive, Eddy Cue, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, Robert Iger and many others. In addition, Schlender knew Jobs personally for 25 years and draws upon his many interviews with him, on and off the record, in writing the book. He and Tetzeli humanize the man and explain, rather than simply describe, his behavior. Along the way, the book provides rich context about the technology revolution we've all lived through, and the ways in which Jobs changed our world.<br /><br /> A rich and revealing account, <i>Becoming Steve Jobs</i> shows us how one of the most colorful and compelling figures of our times was able to combine his unchanging, relentless passion with an evolution in management style to create one of the most valuable and beloved companies on the planet.",4.11,482,Kindle Edition, ,52,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24386240-becoming-steve-jobs,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24386240-becoming-steve-jobs

Jeffrey Tucker, CLO of Liberty.me and Distinguished Fellow of the Foundation for Economic Education, argues that peer-to-peer technology is forging a new and brighter social, economic, and political order. <br /><br />People tend to look at innovations in isolation. Here is my new e-reader. Here is an app I like. Here is my new mobile device and computer. Even bitcoin is routinely analyzed and explained in terms of its properties as an alternative to national currencies, as if there were no more than that at stake.<br /><br />But actually there is a historical trajectory at work here, one that we can trace through its logic, implementation, and spread. It’s the same logic that led from the dial phone at the county store, operated by people pulling and plugging in wires, to the wireless smartphone in your pocket that contains the whole store of human knowledge. It’s all about technology in the service of individuation.<br /><br />Once you understand the driving ethos — voluntarism, creativity, networks, individual initiative — you can see the outlines of a new social structure emerging within our time, an order that defies a century of top-down planning and nation-state restrictionism.<br /><br />It is coming about not because of political reform. It is not any one person’s creation. It is not happening because a group of elite intellectuals advocated it. The new world is emerging organically, and messily, from the ground up, as an extension of unrelenting creativity and experimentation. In the end, it is emerging out of an anarchist order that no one in particular controls and no one in particular can fully understand.<br /><br />""The building of universal prosperity is a process that unfolds bit by bit through decentralized decision making and improvements at the margin through trial-and-error. To continue this process, we need understanding, patience, and dreams. Jeffrey Tucker’s book is an excellent guide to all three.” ~ Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com, from the introduction. <br /><br />“In Bitcoin’s brief existence Jeffrey Tucker has become one of its leading proponents. In this book we can see exactly why. Many people think of bitcoin as just money, but Mr. Tucker is able to explain, in a way that is easily understandable by all, the tsunami of innovation that bitcoin is about to release upon the world.” ~ Roger Ver, Bitcoin investor, from the Foreword",3.36,130,Kindle Edition, ,22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453926-bit-by-bit,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453926-bit-by-bit

When we own our stories, we get to write the ending.</b> </b><br /><br /><b>Don’t miss the hourlong Netflix special <i>Brené Brown: The Call to Courage</i>!</b> <br /><br /> Social scientist Brené Brown has ignited a global conversation on courage, vulnerability, shame, and worthiness. Her pioneering work uncovered a profound truth: Vulnerability—the willingness to show up and be seen with no guarantee of outcome—is the only path to more love, belonging, creativity, and joy. But living a brave life is not always easy: We are, inevitably, going to stumble and fall.<br /><br /> It is the rise from falling that Brown takes as her subject in <i>Rising Strong</i>. As a grounded theory researcher, Brown has listened as a range of people—from leaders in Fortune 500 companies and the military to artists, couples in long-term relationships, teachers, and parents—shared their stories of being brave, falling, and getting back up. She asked herself, <i>What do these people with strong and loving relationships, leaders nurturing creativity, artists pushing innovation, and clergy walking with people through faith and mystery have in common?</i> The answer was clear: They recognize the power of emotion and they’re not afraid to lean in to discomfort.<br /><br /> Walking into our stories of hurt can feel dangerous. But the process of regaining our footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is tested and our values are forged. Our stories of struggle can be big ones, like the loss of a job or the end of a relationship, or smaller ones, like a conflict with a friend or colleague. Regardless of magnitude or circumstance, the rising strong process is the same: We <i>reckon </i>with our emotions and get curious about what we’re feeling; we <i>rumble </i>with our stories until we get to a place of truth; and we live this process, every day, until it becomes a practice and creates nothing short of a <i>revolution</i> in our lives. Rising strong after a fall is how we cultivate wholeheartedness. It’s the process, Brown writes, that teaches us the most about who we are.<br /><br /><b>ONE OF <i>GREATER GOOD</i>’S FAVORITE BOOKS OF THE YEAR</b><br /><br /><b>“[Brené Brown’s] research and work have given us a new vocabulary, a way to talk with each other about the ideas and feelings and fears we’ve all had but haven’t quite known how to articulate. . . .

Un cuento sobre un poderoso emperador que convocó a los sabios y les pidió una frase que sirviese para todas las situaciones posibles. Tras meses de deliberaciones, los sabios se presentaron ante el emperador con una propuesta: «También esto pasará.» Y la madre añadió: «El dolor y la pena pasarán, como pasan la euforia y la felicidad.» Ahora es la madre de Blanca quien ha muerto y esta novela, que arranca y se cierra en un cementerio, habla del dolor de la pérdida, del desgarro de la ausencia. Pero frente a este dolor queda el recuerdo de lo vivido y lo mucho aprendido, y cobra fuerza la reafirmación de la vida a través del sexo, las amigas, los hijos y los hombres que han sido y son importantes para Blanca, quien afirma: «La ligereza es una forma de elegancia. Vivir con ligereza y alegría es dificilísimo.» Esta y otras frases y el tono de la novela, tan ajena a cualquier concesión a lo convencional, evocan aquella Bonjour tristesse de Françoise Sagan, que encandiló a tantos (y escandalizó a no pocos) cuando se publicó en 1954. Todo ello en el transcurso de un verano en Cadaqués, con sus paisajes indómitos y su intensa luz mediterránea que lo baña todo.

A bordo conocerá a la señora Arnoux, casada, mayor que él y residente en París, que se convertirá en su gran amor imposible. Corre el año 1840 y soplan vientos de cambio y modernización en Francia.<br /><br />Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880) emprende en 1864 la escritura de la que sería, para algunos críticos, su más lograda novela. A medida que el trabajo avanza experimenta una especie de «revelación» que le obliga a cambiar la orientación de la novela: Moreau deja de ser un individuo para convertirse en arquetipo de toda una generación. «Quiero hacer –confesaría Flaubert– la historia moral de mi generación; “sentimental” sería más verdadero. Es un libro de amor, de pasión». Pasión amorosa y pasión política para la generación que creció con los ideales de la revolución de 1830, y que fue aplastada en medio de la sangre en las jornadas revolucionarias de 1848 en París, acontecimiento histórico del que esta novela da cumplida cuenta. Este paso de la historia individual, los amores y desventuras de Frédéric, a la historia social, con los vertiginosos sucesos de la revolución, obligó a Flaubert a buscar recursos formales que terminaron por dotar al relato de una modernidad absoluta, clave para el desarrollo posterior de la narrativa.

  <b>An intimate look at the power of intrusive thoughts, how our brains can turn against us, and living with obsessive compulsive disorder</b>
</p><p>Have you ever had a strange urge to jump from a tall building or steer your car into oncoming traffic? You are not alone. In this captivating fusion of science, history, and personal memoir, David Adam explores the weird thoughts that exist within every mind, and how they drive millions of us toward obsession and compulsion.<br /> Adam, an editor at <i>Nature</i> and an accomplished science writer, has suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder for twenty years, and <i>The Man Who Couldn't Stop</i> is his unflinchingly honest attempt to understand the condition and his experiences. What might lead an Ethiopian schoolgirl to eat a wall of her house, piece by piece, or a pair of brothers to die beneath an avalanche of household junk that they had compulsively hoarded? At what point does a harmless idea, a snowflake in a clear summer sky, become a blinding blizzard of unwanted thoughts? Drawing on the latest research on the brain, as well as historical accounts of patients and their treatments, this is a book that will challenge the way you think about what is normal and what is mental illness.<br /> Told with fierce clarity, humor, and urgent lyricism, this extraordinary book is both the haunting story of a personal nightmare and a fascinating doorway into the darkest corners of our minds.</p>",3.87,336,Kindle Edition, ,33,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24586706-the-man-who-couldn-t-stop,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24586706-the-man-who-couldn-t-stop

So where is it? Well, for reasons this book makes crystal clear, that pill will never be the answer—but as a result of the research that’s gone into it, scientists in the last few years have learned more about how women’s sexuality works than we ever thought possible, and <i>Come as You Are</i> explains it all.<br /> <br />The first lesson in this essential, transformative book by Dr. Emily Nagoski is that every woman has her own unique sexuality, like a fingerprint, and that women vary more than men in our anatomy, our sexual response mechanisms, and the way our bodies respond to the sexual world. So we never need to judge ourselves based on others’ experiences. Because women vary, and that’s normal.<br /> <br />Second lesson: sex happens in a context. And all the complications of everyday life influence the context surrounding a woman’s arousal, desire, and orgasm.<br /> <br />Cutting-edge research across multiple disciplines tells us that the most important factor for women in creating and sustaining a fulfilling sex life, is not what you do in bed or how you do it, but <i>how you feel about it</i>. Which means that stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman’s sexual wellbeing; they are central to it. Once you understand these factors, and how to influence them, you can create for yourself better sex and more profound pleasure than you ever thought possible.<br /> <br />And Emily Nagoski can prove it.",4.28,417,Kindle Edition, ,128,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24596066-come-as-you-are,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24596066-come-as-you-are

  <i>New York Times</i>
  <b> bestseller </b>
  <i>George Washington’s Secret Six</i>
  <b>, the little-known story of Thomas Jefferson’s battle to defend America against Islamic pirates.</b>
</b><br /><br />Brian Kilmeade – cohost of “Fox &amp; Friends” on Fox News and the national radio show “Kilmeade &amp; Friends” – returns with another fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. Like their acclaimed bestseller <i>George Washington's Secret Six</i>, <i>Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates</i> sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most Americans.<br />  <br /> Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors, among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states. <br />  <br /> The tiny American flotilla—with three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navy’s top-of-the-line ships—had some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the USS <i>Philadelphia</i> ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded the <i>Philadelphia,</i> and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire.<br />  <br /> Another amazing story is that of William Eaton’s daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time.  <br />  <br /> Few remember Decatur and Eaton today, but their legacy inspired the opening of the Marine Corps Hymn: “From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we fight our country’s battles in the air, on land, and sea.”<br /><i> </i><br /><i>Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates</i> tells a dramatic story of bravery, diplomacy, and battle on the high seas, and honors some of America’s forgotten heroes. ",3.76,238,Hardcover, ,1292,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611888-thomas-jefferson-and-the-tripoli-pirates,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611888-thomas-jefferson-and-the-tripoli-pirates

In the tradition of Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell (she has been compared to both), a singer-songwriter of her kind had not emerged in decades. Now, with over 30 million albums sold worldwide, Jewel tells the story of her life and the lessons learned from her experience and her music.<br /><br />Living on a homestead in Alaska, Jewel learned to yodel at age three and joined her parents' act, working in hotels, honky-tonks, and biker bars. Behind a strong-willed and independent family life, with an emphasis on music and artistic talent, was also instability, abuse, and trauma.<br /><br />At age 15 Jewel was accepted into the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan, where she began writing her own songs as a means of expression. She was 18, homeless, and living out of her car in San Diego when a radio DJ aired a bootleg version of one of her songs. It was requested in the top-10 countdown, something unheard of for an unsigned artist. By age 21, her debut album went multiplatinum.<br /><br />There is so much more to Jewel's story, one complicated by family and financial woes, by crippling fear and insecurity, by parents who forced a child to grow up far too quickly, and by the extraordinary circumstances in which she became a world-famous singer and songwriter. Here Jewel reflects on how she survived and how writing songs, poetry, and prose have saved her life many times over. She writes beautifully about the natural wonders of Alaska, about pain and childhood trauma, and about discovering her own identity years after the entire world had discovered the beauty of her songs.",4.09,387,Hardcover, ,544,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611929-never-broken,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611929-never-broken

There are many ways to think about and deal with death. A good number of them are attempts to escape its grip. However, in this book the philosopher Todd May seeks to confront death in its power and considers the possibility that our mortal deaths are the end of us, and asks what this might mean for our living. What lessons can we draw from our mortality? And how might we live as creatures who die, and who know we are going to die?"" In exploring these questions, May brings together two divergent perspectives on death. The First holds that death is not an evil, or at least that immortality would be far worse than dying. The second holds that death is indeed an evil, and that there is no escaping that fact. May shows that if we are to live with death we need to hold these two perspectives together. Their convergence yields both a beauty and a tragedy to our living that are inextricably entwined.</p>",3.72,198,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24681784,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24681784

Golden Son changed the game and took the story of Darrow to the next level. Now comes the exhilarating conclusion to the Red Rising Trilogy: Morning Star.<br /><br />Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society’s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.<br /> <br />Finally, the time has come.<br /> <br />But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends.

Created in 1811 by a three-man commission featuring headstrong Founding Father Gouverneur Morris, the plan called for a dozen parallel avenues crossing at right angles with many dozens of parallel streets in an unbroken grid. Hills and valleys, streams and ponds, forests and swamps were invisible to the grid; so too were country villages, roads, farms, and estates and generations of property lines. All would disappear as the crosshatch fabric of the grid overspread the island: a heavy greatcoat on the land, the dense undergarment of the future city.<br /><br />No other grid in Western civilization was so large and uniform as the one ordained in 1811. Not without reason. When the grid plan was announced, New York was just under two hundred years old, an overgrown town at the southern tip of Manhattan, a notorious jumble of streets laid at the whim of landowners. To bring order beyond the chaos-and good real estate to market-the street planning commission came up with a monolithic grid for the rest of the island. Mannahatta-the native ""island of hills""-became a place of rectangles, in thousands of blocks on the flattened landscape, and many more thousands of right-angled buildings rising in vertical mimicry.<br /><br />The Manhattan grid has been called ""a disaster"" of urban planning and ""the most courageous act of prediction in Western civilization."" However one feels about it, the most famous urban design of a living city defines its daily life.

</b><br /> The year is 2008 and Samantha Kofer’s career at a huge Wall Street law firm is on the fast track—until the recession hits and she gets downsized, furloughed, escorted out of the building. Samantha, though, is one of the “lucky” associates. She’s offered an opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic for one year without pay, after which there would be a slim chance that she’d get her old job back.<br /><br />In a matter of days Samantha moves from Manhattan to Brady, Virginia, population 2,200, in the heart of Appalachia, a part of the world she has only read about. Mattie Wyatt, lifelong Brady resident and head of the town’s legal aid clinic, is there to teach her how to “help real people with real problems.” For the first time in her career, Samantha prepares a lawsuit, sees the inside of an actual courtroom, gets scolded by a judge, and receives threats from locals who aren’t so thrilled to have a big-city lawyer in town. And she learns that Brady, like most small towns, harbors some big secrets.<br /><br />Her new job takes Samantha into the murky and dangerous world of coal mining, where laws are often broken, rules are ignored, regulations are flouted, communities are divided, and the land itself is under attack from Big Coal.

Yet there’s a black hole at the heart of biology. We do not know why complex life is the way it is, or, for that matter, how life first began. In <em>The Vital Question</em>, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history, putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists.</p><p>For two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to complexity. All complex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen?</p><p>The answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane’s hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a compelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths.</p><p>Both rigorous and enchanting, <em>The Vital Question</em> provides a solution to life’s vital question: why are we as we are, and indeed, why are we here at all?</p>",4.17,369,Kindle Edition, ,34,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24738169-the-vital-question,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24738169-the-vital-question

It spread quickly, confounding the most educated men and prominent politicians in the colony. Neighbors accused neighbors, husbands accused wives, parents and children one another. It ended less than a year later, but not before nineteen men and women had been hanged and an elderly man crushed to death. <br /><br />Speaking loudly and emphatically, adolescent girls stood at the center of the crisis. Along with suffrage and Prohibition, the Salem witch trials represent one of the few moments when women played the central role in American history. Drawing masterfully on the archives, Stacy Schiff introduces us to the strains on a Puritan adolescent's life and to the authorities whose delicate agendas were at risk. She illuminates the demands of a rigorous faith, the vulnerability of settlements adrift from the mother country, perched--at a politically tumultuous time--on the edge of what a visitor termed a ""remote, rocky, barren, bushy, wild-woody wilderness."" With devastating clarity, the textures and tension of colonial life emerge; hidden patterns subtly, startlingly detach themselves from the darkness. Schiff brings early American anxieties to the fore to align them brilliantly with our own. In an era of religious provocations, crowdsourcing, and invisible enemies, this enthralling story makes more sense than ever.<br /><br /><i>The Witches</i> is Schiff's riveting account of a seminal episode, a primal American mystery unveiled--in crackling detail and lyrical prose--by one of our most acclaimed historians.",3.23,498,Hardcover, ,1777,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24819449-the-witches,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24819449-the-witches

Though the year has had its share of misfortune and worry, the Quinns have much to celebrate. Kelley, now single, at least is on better terms with his first wife Margaret, who is using her celebrity to lure customers to the inn in record numbers. Their son Kevin has a beautiful new baby, Genevieve, with the Inn's French housekeeper, Isabelle; and their daughter, Ava, is finally dating a nice guy--her devoted colleague, Scott. <br /><br />Now the Quinns are looking forward to celebrating Genevieve's baptism, welcoming Isabelle to the family, and enjoying the cheer of Nantucket's traditional Christmas Stroll. But just when a peaceful family gathering seems within reach, Kelley's estranged second wife, Mitzi, shows up on the island after souring on her relationship with the inn's former Santa Claus. Soon Kelley isn't the only Quinn entertaining a surprise guest from Christmases past as lovers old and new gather beneath the mistletoe. With jealousy, passion, and eggnog consumption at an all-time high, it's going to take a whole lot more than a Christmas miracle to get the Quinns--and the inn--through the holidays intact. <br /><br /><br />",3.80,263,Hardcover, ,1657,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24819476-winter-stroll,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24819476-winter-stroll

How many will there be? And who will have them? We might imagine—and hope—that today’s industrial revolution will unfold like the last: even as some jobs are eliminated, more will be created to deal with the new innovations of a new era. In <i>Rise of the Robots</i>, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Martin Ford argues that this is absolutely not the case. As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer people will be necessary. Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making “good jobs” obsolete: many paralegals, journalists, office workers, and even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots and smart software. As progress continues, blue and white collar jobs alike will evaporate, squeezing working- and middle-class families ever further. At the same time, households are under assault from exploding costs, especially from the two major industries—education and health care—that, so far, have not been transformed by information technology. The result could well be massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the consumer economy itself.<br /><br />In <i>Rise of the Robots</i>, Ford details what machine intelligence and robotics can accomplish, and implores employers, scholars, and policy makers alike to face the implications.

Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities. In this, Missoula is also typical. <br /> <br />A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are raped each year. Krakauer’s devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault. <br /> <br />Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active; if she had been drinking prior to the assault — and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman’s entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys. <br /> <br />This brutal reality goes a long way towards explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50%, higher than soldiers returning from war.<br /> <br />In Missoula, Krakauer chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula — the nights when they were raped; their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the way they were treated by the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys; the public vilification and private anguish; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them.<br /> <br />Some of them went to the police. Some declined to go to the police, or to press charges, but sought redress from the university, which has its own, non-criminal judicial process when a student is accused of rape. In two cases the police agreed to press charges and the district attorney agreed to prosecute. One case led to a conviction; one to an acquittal. Those women courageous enough to press charges or to speak publicly about their experiences were attacked in the media, on Grizzly football fan sites, and/or to their faces. The university expelled three of the accused rapists, but one was reinstated by state officials in a secret proceeding. One district attorney testified for an alleged rapist at his university hearing. She later left the prosecutor’s office and successfully defended the Grizzlies’ star quarterback in his rape trial. The horror of being raped, in each woman’s case, was magnified by the mechanics of the justice system and the reaction of the community.<br /> <br />Krakauer’s dispassionate, carefully documented account of what these women endured cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape. College-age women are not raped because they are promiscuous, or drunk, or send mixed signals, or feel guilty about casual sex, or seek attention. They are the victims of a terrible crime and deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken.",4.08,368,Hardcover, ,4888,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24911006-missoula,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24911006-missoula

Which favorite presuppositions are unfounded, which statistically biased? By conjoining two opposing mindsets--the suspension of disbelief required in storytelling and the skepticism inherent in the scientific method--bestselling mathematician John Allen Paulos has created an unusual hybrid, a composite of personal memories and mathematical approaches to re-evaluating them.<br /><br />Entertaining vignettes from Paulos's biography abound--ranging from a bullying math teacher and a fabulous collection of baseball cards to romantic crushes, a grandmother’s petty larceny, and his quite unintended role in getting George Bush elected president in 2000. These vignettes serve as springboards to many telling perspectives: simple arithmetic puts life-long habits in a dubious new light; higher dimensional geometry helps us see that we're all rather peculiar; nonlinear dynamics explains the narcissism of small differences cascading into very different siblings; logarithms and exponentials yield insight on why we tend to become bored and jaded as we age; and there are tricks and jokes, probability and coincidences, and much more.<br /><br />For fans of Paulos or newcomers to his work, this witty commentary on his life--and yours--is fascinating reading.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",3.50,206,ebook, ,16,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24940376-a-numerate-life,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24940376-a-numerate-life

But to do so, he'll need to stay alive and ahead of his pursuers. <br /> <br />And in Shanghai, a posthuman child named Ling Shu will go to dangerous and explosive lengths to free her uploaded mother from the grip of Chinese authorities. <br /> <br />The first blows in the war between human and posthuman have been struck.

Que los objetos que creían conocer se disuelven, que las palabras se funden entre sí, que todo lo que parecía tener una forma la pierde. Imaginen que las personan –y su modo de existencia usual- se desdibujan, que pierden sus contornos, que se quedan sin piel que las sostenga. Este inmenso cuadro que se (des)pinta es el que nos presenta Bergson en Materia y memoria. <br />Como si la vida hubiera sido sometida e impulsada por un coeficiente de velocidad distinto al acostumbrado, un cambio de ritmo demoledor, que invade todos los seres y les restituye un movimiento que les viene de algún lado, no se sabe de dónde. Pero sucede que “donde” ya no parece ser una experiencia del cuerpo y del alma. Volvernos a colocar en la duración pura cuyo derramamiento es continuo (…) continuidad realmente vivida pero artificialmente descompuesta para mayor comodidad del conocimiento usual. Tal parece ser la invitación en tono amable que nos cursa Henri Bergson en las páginas de Materia y memoria.<br />Jugar (coquetear con los dualismos). Disociar los mixtos mal planteados y sus malas conexiones para hallar las verdaderas articulaciones interiores-inmanentes de lo real. Percepción y memoria, materia y espíritu, cuerpo y alma.

Algo que no dice mucho, pero que despeja con laborioso rigor las condiciones de la experimentación, pues bajo su hipótesis no subsiste mucho, sólo el suelo del método. Experimentaciones en todos los campos (devastados). Es un llamado que quizás pueda leerse en el pensamiento de Bergson. <br />Y una relación posible con este libro: El arte del escritor consiste sobre todo en hacernos olvidar que él emplea palabras (,,,) las ondulaciones de su pensamiento se comunican al nuestro llevadas por la frase y entonces cada una de las palabras, tomadas individualmente, ya no cuenta: ya no hay nada más que ese sentido moviente que atraviesa las palabras, nada más que dos espíritus que parecen vibrar directamente, sin intermediario, al unísono.",4.10,256,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25019336-materia-y-memoria-ensayo-sobre-la-relaci-n-del-cuerpo-con-el-esp-ritu,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25019336-materia-y-memoria-ensayo-sobre-la-relaci-n-del-cuerpo-con-el-esp-ritu

</b><br /><br />What should be a cozy and fun-filled weekend deep in the English countryside takes a sinister turn in Ruth Ware’s suspenseful, compulsive, and darkly twisted psychological thriller.<br /><br />Leonora, known to some as Lee and others as Nora, is a reclusive crime writer, unwilling to leave her “nest” of an apartment unless it is absolutely necessary. When a friend she hasn’t seen or spoken to in years unexpectedly invites Nora (Lee?) to a weekend away in an eerie glass house deep in the English countryside, she reluctantly agrees to make the trip. Forty-eight hours later, she wakes up in a hospital bed injured but alive, with the knowledge that someone is dead. Wondering not “what happened?” but “what have I done?”, Nora (Lee?) tries to piece together the events of the past weekend. Working to uncover secrets, reveal motives, and find answers, Nora (Lee?) must revisit parts of herself that she would much rather leave buried where they belong: in the past.<br /><br />In the tradition of Paula Hawkins's instant New York Times bestseller The Girl On the Train and S. J. Watson’s riveting national sensation Before I Go To Sleep, this gripping literary debut from UK novelist Ruth Ware will leave you on the edge of your seat through the very last page.",3.70,320,Kindle Edition, ,577,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25062271-in-a-dark-dark-wood,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25062271-in-a-dark-dark-wood

Why would two such men risk not only their lives but the stability of the young country they helped forge? <br /><br />In <em>War of Two</em>, John Sedgwick explores the long-standing conflict between Founding Father Alexander Hamilton and Vice President Aaron Burr. Matching each other’s ambition and skill as lawyers in New York, they later battled for power along political fault lines that would decide—and define—the future of the United States. <br /><br />A series of letters between Burr and Hamilton suggests the duel was fought over an unflattering comment made at a dinner party. But another letter, written by Hamilton the night before the event, provides critical insight into his true motivation. It was addressed to former Speaker of the House Theodore Sedgwick, a trusted friend of both men, and the author’s own ancestor. <br /><br />John Sedgwick suggests that Hamilton saw Burr not merely as a personal rival but as a threat to the nation.

We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?<br /><br />Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?” <br /><br />But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.<br /><br />For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for <i>Modern Romance</i>, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before.<br /><br />In <i>Modern Romance</i>, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.82,290,Kindle Edition, ,475,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25069886-modern-romance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25069886-modern-romance

Entre la atracción y la repulsión, no puede evitar sentirse fascinada por este personaje insólito y perfeccionista, que vive fuera de toda norma social y que la corteja a través de suntuosos regalos robados. «Le gustaba ir siempre bien vestido, incluso para ir a robar una simple lata de conservas. Tan joven y hablando de escritores del XIX. Filosofando. Cuestionándolo todo. Teorizando sobre el individuo y el grupo, y la hipocresía social, y los chivos expiatorios, y Dios y el destino, la virginidad y el sexo. Solía decir que no hay placer comparable a pensar. Y no, no era petulante ni vanidoso. Era simplemente... exhaustivo.» Su necesidad de poner distancia cuando Knut se vuelve demasiado absorbente, pero también su irrefrenable curiosidad y el ansia de vivir experiencias más allá de una existencia excesivamente reglada, llevarán a Sonia a una doble vida secreta en la que quedará atrapada durante años sin posibilidad de exculparse.<br /><br />En esta inusitada historia, Sara Mesa recupera temas que ya aparecieron en sus primeras obras narrativas, dándoles forma a través de un estilo conciso y eléctrico en un mundo –frío, escasamente comunicativo– cuyas reglas establecen únicamente los propios personajes que lo habitan. Cicatriz no es sólo una inquietante historia de amor descompensado protagonizada por dos seres muy distintos pero a la vez complementarios, es también una reflexión sobre la sociedad de consumo y los robos a gran escala en grandes almacenes, la sumisión y el poder, la anulación del deseo y la carnalidad, el refugio de la infancia, la fantasía como alternativa, la culpa y la expiación, la escritura y la vocación literaria.

With their multiple roles of discovery, teaching, and public service, these institutions represent the gold standard in American higher education, but their evolution since the nineteenth century has been only incremental. The need for a new and complementary model that offers accessibility to an academic platform underpinned by knowledge production is critical to our well-being and economic competitiveness.</p><p>Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University and an outspoken advocate for reinventing the public research university, conceived the New American University model when he moved from Columbia University to Arizona State in 2002. Following a comprehensive reconceptualization spanning more than a decade, ASU has emerged as an international academic and research powerhouse that serves as the foundational prototype for the new model. Crow has led the transformation of ASU into an egalitarian institution committed to academic excellence, inclusiveness to a broad demographic, and maximum societal impact.</p><p>In <i>Designing the New American University</i>, Crow and coauthor William B. Dabars—a historian whose research focus is the American research university—examine the emergence of this set of institutions and the imperative for the new model, the tenets of which may be adapted by colleges and universities, both public and private. Through institutional innovation, say Crow and Dabars, universities are apt to realize unique and differentiated identities, which maximize their potential to generate the ideas, products, and processes that impact quality of life, standard of living, and national economic competitiveness. <i>Designing the New American University </i>will ignite a national discussion about the future evolution of the American research university.</p>",3.40,361,Kindle Edition, ,7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25111734-designing-the-new-american-university,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25111734-designing-the-new-american-university

Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br />  <br /><i>Between the World and Me </i>is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder.

Party girl Vicki moved to the City of Light hoping to drink her fill of wine and fall in love. She accomplished her goal, but not without bumps along the way: romantic encounters gone awry, uniquely French situations threatening her sanity, and two adorable yet energetic kids keeping her on her toes. This memoirette takes you on a journey of the ups and downs of Vicki's life abroad. <br /> <br />And each story is paired with a delicious cocktail recipe! You'll enjoy drinks like the Sangria Spritzer, Pretty Good Bloody Mary, and Teeny Bellini. <br /> <br />You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to pour yourself another drink. <br /> <br /><i>A funny memoir about life in Paris, this collection of humorous essays shows the funny side of life, love, and raising a family in the City of Light.</i> <br /> <br /> Interview with the Author  <br /><b>What was your inspiration to write the Confessions series?</b> <br />After a few too many drinks at the bar, I either turn to storytelling or karaoke. I'm much better at storytelling—or so my friends say! They encouraged me to put my tales to paper, and thus was born my series of memoirs, essentially a collection of funny true stories. <br /> <br /><b>OK, so they're technically memoirs. But they seem different than traditional memoirs. How would you categorize them?</b> <br />Most of the bestselling memoirs are written by celebrities, who already have a huge audience. I had to choose a different angle in order to stand out, so I went for humor. I hope people enjoy my funny short stories, which have been compared to chick lit except they're true! I also talk about my travels, so my books would appeal to anyone who likes travel humor and travel memoirs by women. <i>Confessions of a Paris Party Girl</i> is a coming of age memoir with heavy doses of drinking humor, while <i>Confessions of a Paris Potty Trainer</i> is a motherhood book that falls into the parenting humor or pregnancy humor categories. <br /> <br /><b>Yikes... Those are practically spoilers!</b> <br />Sorry! Between my French last name and my author bio, I think the cat might already be out of the bag. However, even if you have a rough idea of how it all ends, you have no idea how rough it was getting there until you read my books! <br /> <br /><b>Aren't there already so many memoirs, and ones about Paris in particular? Why should I choose yours?</b> <br />It's true, there are some really great Paris memoirs out there. The fact that I have read (and enjoyed!) so many bestselling memoirs myself makes me think it's a popular genre for a reason. We're always thirsty for another sip of Paris, right? To travel to Paris through the pages of a book... to fall in love with Paris again! <br /> <br /><b>In what order should I read the books?</b> <br />Each book can stand alone, but like fine wine and pungent cheese, they go great together. I recommend the following order: <br /> <br />- Petite Confessions: A Humorous Memoirette with Sassy Drink Recipes <br />- Confessions of a Paris Party Girl: A Humorous Travel Memoir <br />- Confessions of a Paris Potty Trainer: A Humorous Parenting Memoir <br />- Christmas Confessions &amp; Cocktails: A Humorous Holiday Memoir with Sassy Drink Recipes <br />- Confessions &amp; Cocktails: A Humorous Memoirette with Sassy Drink Recipes <br /> <br />If you enjoy funny true stories, and want to see the crazy things that happened to this American girl in Paris, you'll enjoy the Confessions series.",3.08,113,Kindle Edition, ,35,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25155286-petite-confessions,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25155286-petite-confessions

W. Norton  Company,eng,false,"Most people want to avoid thinking about death, but Caitlin Doughty—a twenty-something with a degree in medieval history and a flair for the macabre—took a job at a crematory, turning morbid curiosity into her life’s work. Thrown into a profession of gallows humor and vivid characters (both living and very dead), Caitlin learned to navigate the secretive culture of those who care for the deceased.<br /><br /><em>Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</em> tells an unusual coming-of-age story full of bizarre encounters and unforgettable scenes. Caring for dead bodies of every color, shape, and affliction, Caitlin soon becomes an intrepid explorer in the world of the dead. She describes how she swept ashes from the machines (and sometimes onto her clothes) and reveals the strange history of cremation and undertaking, marveling at bizarre and wonderful funeral practices from different cultures.<br /><br />Her eye-opening, candid, and often hilarious story is like going on a journey with your bravest friend to the cemetery at midnight. She demystifies death, leading us behind the black curtain of her unique profession. And she answers questions you didn’t know you had: Can you catch a disease from a corpse? How many dead bodies can you fit in a Dodge van? What exactly does a flaming skull look like?<br /><br />Honest and heartfelt, self-deprecating and ironic, Caitlin's engaging style makes this otherwise taboo topic both approachable and engrossing. Now a licensed mortician with an alternative funeral practice, Caitlin argues that our fear of dying warps our culture and society, and she calls for better ways of dealing with death (and our dead).",4.17,254,Paperback, ,4299,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25189315-smoke-gets-in-your-eyes-other-lessons-from-the-crematory,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25189315-smoke-gets-in-your-eyes-other-lessons-from-the-crematory

Here's the good news: your child is probably ready to be potty trained EARLIER than you think (ideally, between 20-30 months), and it can be done FASTER than you expect (most kids get the basics in a few days—but Jamie's got you covered even if it takes a little longer). If you've ever said to yourself:<br /><br />** How do I know if my kid is ready?<br /> ** Why won't my child poop in the potty?<br /> ** How do I avoid ""potty power struggles""?<br /> ** How can I get their daycare provider on board?<br /> ** My kid was doing so well—why is he regressing?<br /> ** And what about nighttime?!<br /><br /><i>Oh Crap! Potty Training</i> can solve all of these (and other) common issues. This isn't theory, you're not bribing with candy, and there are no gimmicks. This is real-world, from-the-trenches potty training information—all the questions and all the ANSWERS you need to do it once and be done with diapers for good.",3.96,294,Paperback, ,807,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25205433-oh-crap-potty-training,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25205433-oh-crap-potty-training

Their choices are limited by mountains, rivers, seas, and concrete. To understand world events, news organizations and other authorities often focus on people, ideas, and political movements, but without geography, we never have the full picture. Now, in the relevant and timely <i>Prisoners of Geography</i>, seasoned journalist Tim Marshall examines Russia, China, the USA, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Japan and Korea, and Greenland and the Arctic—their weather, seas, mountains, rivers, deserts, and borders—to provide a context often missing from our political reportage: how the physical characteristics of these countries affect their strengths and vulnerabilities and the decisions made by their leaders.<br /><br />In ten, up-to-date maps of each region, Marshall explains in clear and engaging prose the complex geo-political strategies of these key parts of the globe. What does it mean that Russia must have a navy, but also has frozen ports six months a year? How does this affect Putin’s treatment of Ukraine? How is China’s future constrained by its geography?

Little did he know that among those released was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too dangerous even for al-Qaeda and give rise to an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East.<br />     Zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in Jordan from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion of that country in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, the CIA inadvertently created a monster. Like-minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until Jordanian intelligence provided the Americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate Zarqawi in a 2006 airstrike.<br />     But his movement endured, first called al-Qaeda in Iraq, then renamed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, seeking refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. And as the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of a sweeping, ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate. <br />     Drawing on unique access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Joby Warrick weaves together heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational details with overarching historical perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today's most dangerous Islamic extremist threat.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.34,368,ebook, ,854,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25241317-black-flags,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25241317-black-flags

A las puertas de las elecciones presidenciales de 2022. Los partidos tradicionales se han hundido en las encuestas y Mohammed Ben Abbes, carismático líder de una nueva formación islamista moderada, derrota con el apoyo de los socialistas y de la derecha a la candidata del Frente Nacional en la segunda vuelta. François, un profesor universitario hastiado de la docencia y de su vida sexual, que a sus cuarenta años se había resignado a una vida aburrida pero sosegada, ve cómo la rápida transformación que sucede a la llegada del nuevo presidente al Elíseo altera la vida cotidiana de los franceses y le depara a él un inesperado futuro. Los judíos han emigrado a Israel, en las calles las mujeres han cambiado las faldas por conjuntos de blusas largas y pantalones, y algunos comercios han cerrado sus puertas o reorientado el negocio. Y la Sorbona es ahora una universidad islámica en la que los profesores conversos gozan de excelentes salarios y tienen derecho a la poligamia. Al igual que Huysmans, el escritor del siglo XIX convertido al catolicismo al que consagró su tesis, François sopesará pronunciar las palabras que le abrirán las puertas de la religión islámica y de una nueva vida: «No hay más dios que Alá y Mahoma es su profeta.»<br /><br />Sumisión llegó a las librerías francesas el mismo día del trágico atentado contra Charlie Hebdo y Houellebecq, acusado de islamofobia o de dar alas a la extrema derecha, afirmó: «No tomo partido, no defiendo ningún régimen. Deniego toda responsabilidad. He acelerado la historia, pero no puedo decir que sea una provocación, porque no digo cosas que considere falsas sólo para poner nerviosos a los demás.» Más allá de la polémica, Sumisión es una novela de «política ficción» –como 1984 y Un mundo feliz–, una turbadora fábula política y moral, en la que coexisten intuiciones poéticas, efectos cómicos y una melancolía fatalista.<br /><br />«Si hay alguien hoy, en la literatura mundial, que reflexiona sobre la enorme mutación que todos sentimos que se halla en curso sin que tengamos los medios para analizarla, es Houellebecq» (Emmanuel Carrère).<br /><br />«La novela más densa e inquietante de Michel Houellebecq. Una meditación sobre el declive de nuestra sociedad y el deseo de sumisión» (Guy Duplat).<br /><br />«Divertida, impertinente y desesperada, Sumisión esconde una inaudita lección. Menos escandalosa de lo que se ha dicho y más sutil de lo que parece» (Sébastien Lapaque, Le Figaro).<br /><br />«Michel Houellebecq describe el malestar desde el interior, como un médico, más interesado en sanar que en denunciar» (Pascal Bruckner).<br /><br />«Sumisión marca uno de esos hitos excepcionales en los que la política y el arte coinciden. El más destacado misántropo literario europeo ofrece una visión fascinante y asombrosamente pesimista de la naturaleza humana» (Christopher de Bellaigue, The Guardian).<br /><br />«No es sólo un escritor de sátiras sino que es un “sincero” escritor de sátiras, francamente entristecido ante los disparates de la historia y la locura humana, y eso es más inusual» (Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker).<br /><br />«Houellebecq es uno de los observadores más talentosos de las mentiras y contradicciones de nuestras existencias» (Iris Radisch, Die Zeit).",3.65,288,Paperback,Panorama de narrativas #893,259,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25293873-sumisi-n,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25293873-sumisi-n
