Enayat examines the concept of the Islamic state, and the Muslim repsonse to the challenge of alien and modern ideologies such as nationlism, democracy and socialism, as well as notions of Shi'i modernism, much neglected in Western writings.

The next essay, looking into the origins of guilt and punishment, shows how the concept of justice was born — and how internalization of this concept led to the development of what people called ""the soul."" In the third essay, Nietzsche dissects the meaning of ascetic ideals.<br />It is not Nietzsche's intention to reject ascetic ideals, ""slave"" morality, or internalized values out of hand; his main concern is to show that culture and morality, rather than being eternal verities, are human-made.

After a resounding electoral triumph in 1906, the Liberals formed the government of the most powerful nation on earth, yet within a few years the House of Lords lost its absolute veto over legislation, the Home Rule crisis brought Ireland to the brink of civil war and led to an army mutiny, the campaign for woman’s suffrage created widespread civil disorder and discredited the legal and penal systems, and an unprecedented wave of strikes swept the land.<br /><br />This is a classic account, first published in 1935, of the dramatic upheaval and political change that overwhelmed England in the period 1910-1914. Few books of history retain their relevance and vitality after more than sixty years. <i>The Strange Death of Liberal England</i> is one of the most important books of the English past, a prime example that history can be abiding literature. As a portrait of England enmeshed in the turbulence of new movements, which often led to violence against the pieties of Liberal England—until it was overwhelmed by the greatest violence of all, World War I—this extraordinary book has continued to exert a powerful influence on the way historians have observed early twentieth-century England.<br /><br /></div>",4.10,449,Paperback, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135772.The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England_1910_1914,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135772.The_Strange_Death_of_Liberal_England_1910_1914

With scathing wit, Swift pits master against servant in an endless struggle for order, frugality, and the best bits of the roast.

It's just not easy being an ethical serial killer - especially while trying to avoid the unshakable suspicions of the dangerous Sergeant Doakes (who believes Dexter is a homicidal maniac...which, of course, he is). In an attempt to throw Doakes off his trail, Dexter has had to slip deep into his foolproof disguise. While not working as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he now spends nearly all his time with his cheerful girlfriend, Rita, and her two children, sipping light beer and slowly becoming the world's first serial couch potato.

How long before his Dark Passenger forces him to drop the charade and let his inner monster run free?<br /><br />In trying times, opportunity knocks. A particularly nasty psychopath is cutting a trail through Miami - a man whose twisted technique leaves even Dexter speechless. As Dexter's dark appetite is revived, his sister, Deborah (a newly minted, tough-as-nails Miami detective), is drawn headlong into the case. It quickly becomes clear that it will take a monster to catch a monster - but it isn't until his archnemesis is abducted that Dex can finally throw himself into the search for a new plaything.

More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. ""In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey,"" the narrator recalls. ""Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket."" And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupéry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote>I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. ""Trying to be witty,"" we're told at one point, ""leads to lying, more or less."" But Saint-Exupéry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>",4.31,112,Paperback, ,417,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136538.The_Little_Prince,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136538.The_Little_Prince

It's not that she doesn't enjoy teaching a weekly ""Potluck Cooking Class"" at the community outreach center. Or that she's not excited about her sister Andrea's bun in the oven -- watching the very pregnant Andrea try to sit on a stool at The Cookie Jar is worth it every time.<br /><br />Maybe it's this year's sheriff's election that's got her down. For years, Sheriff Grant's been the iron hand in town. But now, Hannah's brother-in-law Bill is giving the old blowhard the fight of his long, dubious career -- and Grant's not taking it in stride, especially once the local polls (and The Cookie Jar gossip) show Bill pulling ahead.<br /><br />But before anyone can get a taste of victory, things go sour. Just as Hannah's emptying the trash, she makes a very unappetizing discovery: Sheriff Grant's body in the dumpster behind the high school where she's teaching her cooking class. And if that weren't bad enough, the poor man still has fudge frosting on his shirt from the cupcake she gave him earlier. She'd been trying to find the secret ingredient left out of the recipe. Now she has a more important mystery to crack.<br /><br />The number one suspect is none other than Bill. In fact, he's the only suspect. But Hannah's not swallowing it. Plenty of people had reason to hate Sheriff Grant, starting with all the deputies whose cases he stole during election years just so he could take the glory. Soon, Hannah's dishing up scandalous secrets, steaming hot betrayals, and enough nastiness to keep the gossip mill at The Cookie Jar going through several pots of decaf.

Reginald Horsman's book is the first study to examine the origins of racialism in America and to show that the belief in white American superiority was firmly ensconced in the nation's ideology by 1850.<br /><br />The author deftly chronicles the beginnings and growth of an ideology stressing race, basic stock, and attributes in the blood. He traces how this ideology shifted from the more benign views of the Founding Fathers, which embraced ideas of progress and the spread of republican institutions for all. He finds linkages between the new, racialist ideology in America and the rising European ideas of Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic, and scientific ideologies of the early nineteenth century. Most importantly, however, Horsman demonstrates that it was the merging of the Anglo-Saxon rhetoric with the experience of Americans conquering a continent that created a racialist philosophy. Two generations before the ""new"" immigrants began arriving in the late nineteenth century, Americans, in contact with blacks, Indians, and Mexicans, became vociferous racialists.<br /><br />In sum, even before the Civil War, Americans had decided that peoples of large parts of this continent were incapable of creating or sharing in efficient, prosperous, democratic governments, and that American Anglo-Saxons could achieve unprecedented prosperity and power by the outward thrust of their racialism and commercial penetration of other lands. The comparatively benevolent view of the Founders of the Republic had turned into the quite malevolent ideology that other peoples could not be ""regenerated"" through the spread of free institutions.",3.82,380,Paperback, ,13,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137278.Race_and_Manifest_Destiny,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137278.Race_and_Manifest_Destiny

Now the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author whose work has been called “gripping” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>), “chilling” (<i>The Denver Post</i>), “wonderful” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), ratchets up the stakes in an ingeniously plotted story of nerve-jangling intrigue and hot-wired suspense. Using today’s cutthroat global economy as a backdrop, <b>The First Billion</b> explodes into a breakneck tale of betrayal, revenge, and redemption...<br /><br />John “Jett” Gavallan is a former fighter pilot, now the high-flying CEO of Black Jet Securities, an investment firm that earned its first billion before the techno dream crashed and burned. Poised for an offering crucial to his company’s survival, Gavallan is banking on the riskiest gamble of his dazzling career. In exactly six days, he will take Mercury Broadband, Russia’s leading media company, public on the New York Stock Exchange. But rumors of fraud have suddenly surfaced that could send the deal south. Gavallan makes a preemptive strike by dispatching his number-two man--fellow Desert Storm fighter pilot Grafton Byrnes--to Moscow to penetrate the shadowy Russian multinational. When Byrnes fails to return, Gavallan fears the worst. But <br />the truth is even more diabolical than he can imagine.<br /><br />Plunging into a desperate search for his best friend, the renegade top gun is suddenly fighting a different kind of war, where there is no safe harbor and no one he can trust. Not Konstantin Kirov, the elusive head of Mercury Broadband who may not be what he seems. Not the bankers and traders Gavallan does business with every day. Not the exotic beauty who has told him all her deepest secrets--except one. Suddenly Jett finds himself trapped in a conspiracy that could shatter the delicate balance between nations--and plunge the global economy into chaos. Hunted by the F.B.I. and a band of elite killers, Jett races from Palm Beach to Zurich to Moscow in a desperate search for answers. But for this brave ex-commando haunted by visions of war, the truth comes at a terrible price. With Mercury rising and the hours ticking down, he is moving closer to a place where murder and revenge are the currency of choice...and where the first billion is the ultimate insider secret--and the deadliest obsession of all.<br /><br />With breakneck plotting, stunning realism, and a sense of danger that keeps the heart racing, <b>The First Billion</b> is a knockout of a novel that will linger long after the final shocking twist is revealed.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.86,608,Paperback, ,70,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137473.The_First_Billion,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137473.The_First_Billion

This memoir is Goldin’s passionate and painful account of her childhood in a poor Jewish household and her emigration to the United States in 1975. As she recalls trips to the market and the mikvah, and as she evokes ritual celebrations like weddings, Goldin chronicles her childhood, her extended family, and the lives of the women in her community in Shiraz, a southern Iranian city. Her memoir details her parents’ ""courtship"" (her father selected her mother from a group of adolescent girls), her mother’s lonely life as a child-bride, and Goldin’s childhood home which was presided over by her paternal grandmother. Goldin’s memoir conveys not just the personal trauma of growing up in a family fraught with discord but also the tragic human costs of religious dogmatism. In Goldin’s experience, Jewish fundamentalism was intensified by an Islamic context. Although the Muslims were antagonistic to Jews, their views on women’s roles and their treatment of women influenced the attitude and practices of some Iranian Jews. In this brave and dispassionate portrayal of a little-known corner of Jewish life, Farideh Goldin confronts profound sadness yet captures the joys of a child’s wonder as she savors the scenes and textures and scents of Jewish Iran.

It is currently enjoying a new vogue and a wider readership with the publication of such novels as <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, <i>The Rule of Four</i>, and <i>Codex</i>. What these books have in common, and what <i>The Geographer's Library</i> can also claim, is a set of characters in the here and now grappling with questions about things that went on a very long time ago. Another characteristic is the unearthing or explanation of objects of great value. The trick is to weave these two realities together in a compelling way, one that will keep the reader involved in both stories.<p> Jon Fasman has taken a big chance with <i>The Geographer's Library</i>, his debut novel, setting out a complicated scenario in which a collection of priceless objects is stolen from the titular library and, eventually, scattered and re-collected a thousand years later--with very bad results for the final collector. The geographer is a real person, Al-Idrisi, a Spanish-Muslim philosopher, cartographer, linguist, and scholar who served in the court of King Roger of Sicily in Palermo in the year 1154. For the most part, Fasman's risk pays off, although there is a lot of meandering before we finally get to the final revelation.</p><p> The ""wraparound"" story is about a young journalist, Paul Tomm, who sets out to write a simple obituary about a professor who died in his office at Paul's Alma Mater. The man is Jaan Puhapaev, an Estonian perhaps, who is a terrible teacher, fires his gun out his office window twice, is odd, unavailable, and reclusive and yet is allowed to stay on for unknown reasons. He also collects only $1.00 a year in salary and has no other visible means of support. The core narrative is a description of the provenance and travels of each of the 15 objects--some or all of which may hold the secret of eternal life--stolen from Al-Idrisi. </p><p> A professor friend of Paul's, a policemen and a curious editor all get an investigation rolling regarding what really happened to Jaan, who is he, and is he perhaps much, much older than they think? Paul meets and falls for a neighbor and putative friend of Jaan's, a music teacher named Hannah Rowe, which moves the information curve upward. This is the least believable part of the story: it's easier to accept the alchemical power of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes than Hannah. That said, Fasman does bring it all home at the end with an expository chapter and two letters. A bit of a cheat, but at least the reader is neatly taken off the literary hook he has dangled on for 380 pages. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>",3.03,374,Paperback, ,361,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137936.The_Geographer_s_Library,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137936.The_Geographer_s_Library

Edmund Wilson counted him as 'one of the half dozen greatest English writers,' and T. S. Eliot has paid tribute to the Shakespearean quality of Keats's greatness. Indeed, his work has survived better than that of any of his contemporaries the devaluation of Romantic poetry that began early in this century. This Modern Library edition contains all of Keats's magnificent verse: 'Lamia,' 'Isabella,' and 'The Eve of St. Agnes'; his sonnets and odes; the allegorical romance <i>Endymion;</i> and the five-act poetic tragedy <i>Otho the Great.</i> Presented as well are the famous posthumous and fugitive poems, including the fragmentary 'The Eve of Saint Mark' and the great 'La Belle Dame sans Merci,' perhaps the most distinguished literary ballad in the language.

Orr focuses not on problems in education, but on the problem of education. Much of what has gone wrong with the world, he argues, is the result of inadequate and misdirected education that: alienates us from life in the name of human domination; causes students to worry about how to make a living before they know who they are; overemphasizes success and careers; separates feeling from intellect and the practical from the theoretical; deadens the sense of wonder for the created world. is, first and foremost, an educational challenge. The author begins by establishing the grounds for a debate about education and knowledge. He describes the problems of education from an ecological perspective, and challenges the terrible simplifiers who wish to substitute numbers for values. He follows with a presentation of principles for re-creating education in the broadest way possible, discussing topics such as biophilia, the disciplinary structure of knowledge, the architecture of educational buildings, and the idea of ecological intelligence.

When the opportunity arose to train in the kitchen of Mario Batali’s three-star New York restaurant, Babbo, Buford grabbed it. <i>Heat </i>is the chronicle—sharp, funny, wonderfully exuberant—of his time spent as Batali’s “slave” and of his far-flung apprenticeships with culinary masters in Italy.<br /><br />In a fast-paced, candid narrative, Buford describes the frenetic experience of working in Babbo’s kitchen: the trials and errors (and more errors), humiliations and hopes, disappointments and triumphs as he worked his way up the ladder from slave to cook. He talks about his relationships with his kitchen colleagues and with the larger-than-life, hard-living Batali, whose story he learns as their friendship grows through (and sometimes despite) kitchen encounters and after-work all-nighters. <br /><br />Buford takes us to the restaurant in a remote Appennine village where Batali first apprenticed in Italy and where Buford learns the intricacies of handmade pasta . . . the hill town in Chianti where he is tutored in the art of butchery by Italy’s most famous butcher, a man who insists that his meat is an expression of the Italian soul . . . to London, where he is instructed in the preparation of game by Marco Pierre White, one of England’s most celebrated (or perhaps notorious) chefs. And throughout, we follow the thread of Buford’s fascinating reflections on food as a bearer of culture, on the history and development of a few special dishes (Is the shape of tortellini really based on a woman’s navel? And just what is a short rib?), and on the what and why of the foods we eat today.<br /><br /><i>Heat</i> is a marvelous hybrid: a richly evocative memoir of Buford’s kitchen adventure, the story of Batali’s amazing rise to culinary (and extra-culinary) fame, a dazzling behind-the-scenes look at the workings of a famous restaurant, and an illuminating exploration of why food matters. <br /><br />It is a book to delight in—and to savor.",3.90,336,Hardcover, ,1740,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139220.Heat,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139220.Heat

At a time when one in four black men are caught in the web of the criminal justice system, Asha Bandele shatters the myths of prisoners' wives and tells a story of embracing the beauty of love in the ugliest circumstances and of people's ability to change, to do better, to grow. <br /><br />Whether she is describing her restricted but romantic courtship with Rashid -- when letters were like dates, like ""whispers on the slow, blue-light dance floor"" -- or riding the bus upstate with the other wives and girlfriends, Asha Bandele creates haunting images and reflections so powerful and unique that they beg to be reread and savored. At the same time that she recalls the extreme ups and downs that accompany a relationship constantly scrutinized by guards and surveillance cameras, she confronts her own dark secrets and sadness. The love of a man with an ugly past but a firm belief in redemption is what heals her broken spirit and grants her the courage and confidence to embrace life again. <br /><br />This is a love story extraordinary in its circumstances but universal in its message. With unblinking honesty, Asha Bandele writes about the tenuous balance of power upon which most relationships rest, the deep needs that bring two people together, the jealousy and insecurity that can drive them apart.

His arrival at his destination, the legendary tower of Qabus, although a wonder in itself, it not nearly so amazing as the thoroughly captivating, at times zany, record of his adventures.

And he tells the story of his dream to climb the world's Seven Summits, and how he is turning that dream into astonishing reality (something fewer than a hundred mountaineers have done). <br /><br />From the snow-capped summit of McKinley to the towering peaks of Aconcagua and Kilimanjaro to the ultimate challenge, Mount Everest, this is a story about daring to dream in the face of impossible odds. It is about finding the courage to reach for that ultimate summit, and transforming your life into something truly miraculous.<br /><br />""I admire you immensely. You are an inspiration to other blind people and plenty of folks who can see just fine.""

Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm.

After her many years as a teacher and writer, she realized that there was no comprehensive primer for vegetarian cooking, no single book that taught vegetarians basic cooking techniques, how to combine ingredients, and how to present vegetarian dishes with style. <i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> teaches readers how to build flavor into vegetable dishes, how to develop vegetable stocks, and how to choose, care for, and cook the many vegetables available to cooks today. <i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> is in every way Deborah Madison’s magnum opus, featuring 1,400 recipes suitable for committed vegetarians, vegans (in most cases), and everyone else who loves good food. For nonvegetarians, the recipes can be served alongside meat, fish, or fowl and incorporated into a truly contemporary style of eating that emphasizes vegetables and fruits for health and well-being.<br /><br /><i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> is the most comprehensive vegetarian cookbook ever published. The recipes, which range from appetizers to desserts, are colorful and imaginative as well as familiar and comforting. Madison introduces readers to innovative main course salads; warm and cold soups; vegetable braises and cobblers; golden-crusted gratins; Italian favorites like pasta, polenta, pizza, and risotto; savory tarts and galettes; grilled sandwiches and quesadillas; and creative dishes using grains and heirloom beans. At the heart of the book is the A-to-Z vegetable chapter, which describes the unique personalities of readily available vegetables, the sauces and seasonings that best complement them, and the simplest ways to prepare them. “Becoming a Cook” teaches cooking basics, from holding a knife to planning a menu, and “Foundations of Flavor” discusses how to use sauces, herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars to add flavor and character to meatless dishes. In each chapter, the recipes range from those suitable for everyday dining to dishes for special occasions. And through it all, Madison presents a philosophy of cooking that is both practical and inspiring.<br /><br />Despite its focus on meatless cooking, <i>Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone</i> is not just for vegetarians—it's for everyone interested in learning how to cook vegetables creatively, healthfully, and passionately. The recipes are remarkably straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients in inspiring combinations. Some are simple, others more complex, but all are written with an eye toward the seasonality of produce. Madison's joyful and free-spirited approach to cooking will send you into the kitchen with confidence and enthusiasm. Whether you are a kitchen novice or an experienced cook, this wonderful cookbook has something for everyone.</p>",3.91,752,Hardcover, ,285,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141051.Vegetarian_Cooking_for_Everyone,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/141051.Vegetarian_Cooking_for_Everyone

As a flight director in NASA’s Mission Control, Kranz witnessed firsthand the making of history. He participated in the space program from the early days of the Mercury program to the last Apollo mission, and beyond. He endured the disastrous first years when rockets blew up and the United States seemed to fall further behind the Soviet Union in the space race. He helped to launch Alan Shepard and John Glenn, then assumed the flight director’s role in the Gemini program, which he guided to fruition. With his teammates, he accepted the challenge to carry out President John F.

Selected by a vote of the membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), these 26 reprints represent the best, most important, and most influential stories and authors in the field. The contributors are a Who's Who of classic SF, with every Golden Age giant included: Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, John W. Campbell, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, Cordwainer Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny. Other contributors are less well known outside the core SF readership. Three of the contributors are famous for one story--but what stories!--Tom Godwin's pivotal hard-SF tale, ""The Cold Equations""; Jerome Bixby's ""It's a <i>Good</i> Life"" (made only more infamous by the chilling <i>Twilight Zone</i> adaptation); and Daniel Keyes's ""Flowers for Algernon"" (brought to mainstream fame by the movie adaptation, <i>Charly</i>).<p> The collection has some minor but frustrating flaws. There are no contributor biographies, which is bad enough when the author is a giant; but it's especially sad for contributors who have become unjustly obscure. Each story's original publication date is in small print at the bottom of the first page. And neither this fine print nor the copyright page identifies the magazines in which the stories first appeared.</p><p> Prefaced by editor Robert Silverberg's introduction, which describes SFWA and details the selection process, <i>The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964</i> is a wonderful book for the budding SF fan. Experienced SF readers should compare the table of contents to their library before making a purchase decision. Fans who contemplate giving this book to non-SF readers should bear in mind that, while several of the collected stories can measure up to classic mainstream literary stories, the less literarily-acceptable stories are weighted toward the front of the collection; adult mainstream-literature fans may not get very far into <i>The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964</i>. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p><br /><br />· Introduction · Robert Silverberg · in <br />· A Martian Odyssey [Tweel] · Stanley G.

Extensive sections on Beans, Vegetables, Grains, and Dairy explore the myriad ways these staples are enjoyed worldwide. Each section opens with a detailed introduction; Madhur describes methods for preparation and storage, as well as different cooking techniques and their cultural origins.

She also offers substantial sections on Soups, Salads, and Drinks, as well as Sauces and Other Flavorings, to help round out a meatless meal and add exciting new flavors to even the most easily prepared dishes. Finally, a complete glossary of ingredients and techniques clarifies some of the little-known elements of the world's cuisines so that even the uninitiated can bring the flavors of Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and more to their tables.<br />        <br />Throughout this extensive collection, Madhur includes personal anecdotes and historical contexts that bring her recipes to life, whether she's remembering field of leeks she saw in the mountains of northern Greece or describing how corn-based dishes arrived in Indonesia through colonial trade.

Few people realize that the facts of his life make for a much better tale. Kidd was actually a tough New York sea captain hired to chase pirates, a married war hero whose secret mission took a spectacularly bad turn. This harrowing tale traces Kidd's voyages in the 1690s from his home near Wall Street to Whitehall Palace in London, from the ports of the Caribbean to a secret pirate paradise off Madagascar. Author Richard Zacks, during his research, also unearthed the story of a long forgotten rogue named Robert Culliford, who dogged Kidd and led Kidd's crew to mutiny not once but twice. The lives of Kidd and Culliford play out like an unscripted duel: one man would hang in the harbor, the other would walk away with the treasure.

Their world was an insulated, close-knit community of grass-roofed cottages, cattle herders, and tribal councils. The lions and pythons that prowled beyond the village fences were the greatest threat they knew. All that changed the night the government-armed Murahiliin began attacking their villages.<br /><br />Amid the chaos, screams, conflagration, and gunfire, 5-year-old Benson and 7-year-old Benjamin fled into the dark night. Two years later, Alepho, age 7, was forced to do the same. Across the Southern Sudan, over the next 5 years, thousands of other boys did likewise, joining this stream of child refugees that became known as the Lost Boys. Their journey would take them more than 1000 miles across a war-ravaged country, through landmine-sown paths, crocodile-infested waters, and grotesque extremes of hunger, thirst, and disease. The refugee camps they eventually filtered through offered little respite from the brutality they were fleeing.<br /><br />In <i>They Poured Fire on Us From the Sky</i>, Alepho, Benson, and Benjamin, by turn, recount their experiences along this unthinkable journey. They vividly recall the family, friends, and tribal world they left far behind them and their desperate efforts to keep track of one another.

But Buddhism has also inspired some of the greatest philosophical writings of any religion, and two such works lie at the center of Zen: The Heart Sutra, which monks recite all over the world, and The Diamond Sutra, said to contain answers to all questions of delusion and dualism. This is the Buddhist teaching on the perfection of wisdom and cuts through all obstacles on the path of practice. As Red Pine explains: The Diamond Sutra may look like a book, but it's really the body of the Buddha. It's also your body, my body, all possible bodies. But it's a body with nothing inside and nothing outside. It doesn't exist in space or time. Nor is it a construct of the mind. It's no mind. And yet because it's no mind, it has room for compassion. This book is the offering of no mind, born of compassion for all suffering beings.

</b><br />Lucas, a musician and translator living in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, comes home one day to find this cryptic invitation. When he appears at the appointed time, he sets in motion a series of bizarre, seemingly interconnected events that disrupt his previously passive existence. He meets the alluring Nuria and they begin an intense love affair. He is approached by a band of Barcelona’s mythic roof dwellers and has a run-in with a fire-eating prophet. <br /><br />But when he and Nuria are kidnapped by a religious cult with roots stretching back to the thirteenth-century, Lucas realizes that his life is spinning out of control. The cult’s megalomaniac leader, Pontneuf, maintains that Nuria and Lucas are essential to his plan to revive the religion. While Nuria is surprisingly open to Pontneuf and his theories, Lucas is outraged and makes his escape. Back in Barcelona, Lucas wanders the streets in a drug-and-alcohol induced haze, pining for Nuria and struggling to make sense of what happened to him. He recounts his improbable adventures to his friends, who are wholly entertained by the story and deeply dubious of its truth, an understandable skepticism as Lucas fast becomes the quintessential unreliable narrator. <br /><br /><br />With the alluring and enchanting Barcelona as a vibrant backdrop, <i>The Color of a Dog Running Away</i> is a love story, tale of adventure and historical thriller all rolled into one unforgettable and mesmerizing package; a novel that will beguile and disturb in equal measure.",3.08,320,Hardcover, ,30,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144756.The_Color_of_A_Dog_Running_Away,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144756.The_Color_of_A_Dog_Running_Away

The vast information, assembled so beautifully, transcends usual scholarship. Eliade always affirms the greater experience in all initiations - the indissoluble tie between humans and the cosmos of Gods, spirits, animals ancestors, and nature. The absence of initiation in our culture has left modern men and women often isolated from each other, from the invisible powers beyond, and from the myths that sustain daily life. The primal soul desire for symbolic rituals pushes youth into substitutes for initiatory experience: gangs, suicide, car crashes, teenage pregnancy, street drugs. These ""symptoms"" show the unquenchable urge for existential transformation and the need for elders, mentors, and rituals.

His explanation derives from a profound understanding of Sufism, and extends to many aspects which are usually neglected. His illuminating answer to 'What is Sufism?' gives a taste of the very subject matter itself. What do Sufis believe? What do they aim at? What do they do? Unlike other writers on the subject, Martin Lings treats all the three questions with equal justice. He is thus able to give a wealth of answers to the main question 'What is Sufism?', each answer being from a different angle but all going to the root of the matter. A reviewer wrote 'Should the book appear in paperback, I would use it for undergraduate and graduate courses on Islamic civilization', and in fact <i>What is Sufism?</i> has become a set book in colleges and universities on both sides of the Atlantic.

Moehringer grew up captivated by a voice. It was the voice of his father, a New York City disc jockey who vanished before J.R. spoke his first word. Sitting on the stoop, pressing an ear to the radio, J.R. would strain to hear in that plummy baritone the secrets of masculinity and identity. Though J.R.'s mother was his world, his rock, he craved something more, something faintly and hauntingly audible only in The Voice. <br /><br />At eight years old, suddenly unable to find The Voice on the radio, J.R. turned in desperation to the bar on the corner, where he found a rousing chorus of new voices. Cops and poets, bookies and soldiers, movie stars and stumblebums, all sorts of men gathered in the bar to tell their stories and forget their cares. The alphas along the bar—including J.R.'s Uncle Charlie, a Humphrey Bogart look-alike; Colt, a Yogi Bear sound-alike; and Joey D, a softhearted brawler—took J.R. to the beach, to ballgames, and ultimately into their circle. They taught J.R., tended him, and provided a kind of fatherhood-by-committee. <br /><br />Torn between the stirring example of his mother and the lurid romance of the bar, J.R. tried to forge a self somewhere in the center. But when it was time for J.R. to leave home, the bar became an increasingly seductive sanctuary, a place to return and regroup during his picaresque journeys—from his grandfather's tumbledown house to the hallowed towers and spires of Yale; from his absurd stint selling housewares at Lord &amp; Taylor to his dream job at the New York Times, which became a nightmare when he found himself a faulty cog in a vast machine. Time and again the bar offered shelter from failure, rejection, heartbreak--and eventually from reality. <br /><br />In the grand tradition of landmark memoirs, The Tender Bar is suspenseful, wrenching, and achingly funny. A classic American story of self-invention and escape, of the fierce love between a single mother and an only son, it's also a moving portrait of one boy's struggle to become a man, and an unforgettable depiction of how men remain, at heart, lost boys.",3.94,416,Paperback, ,2438,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144977.The_Tender_Bar,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144977.The_Tender_Bar

The best bones weren’t on trails—deer and moose don’t die conveniently—and soon I was wandering so far into the woods that I needed a map and compass to find my way home. When winter came and snow blew into the mountains, burying the bones, I continued to spend my days and often my nights in the woods. I vaguely understood that I was doing this because I could no longer think; I found relief in walking up hills. When the night temperatures dropped below zero, I felt visited by necessity, a baseline purpose, and I walked for miles, my only objective to remain upright, keep moving, preserve warmth. When I was lost, I told myself stories . . .”</i><br /><br />So Charles D’Ambrosio recounted his life in Philipsburg, Montana, the genesis of the brilliant stories collected here, six of which originally appeared in The New Yorker. Each of these eight burnished, terrifying, masterfully crafted stories is set against a landscape that is both deeply American and unmistakably universal. A son confronts his father’s madness and his own hunger for connection on a misguided hike in the Pacific Northwest. A screenwriter fights for his sanity in the bleak corridors of a Manhattan psych ward while lusting after a ballerina who sets herself ablaze. A Thanksgiving hunting trip in Northern Michigan becomes the scene of a haunting reckoning with marital infidelity and desperation. And in the magnificent title story, carpenters building sets for a porn movie drift dreamily beneath a surface of sexual tension toward a racial violence they will never fully comprehend. Taking place in remote cabins, asylums, Indian reservations, the backloads of Iowa and the streets of Seattle, this collection of stories, as muscular and challenging as the best novels, is about people who have been orphaned, who have lost connection, and who have exhausted the ability to generate meaning in their lives. Yet in the midst of lacerating difficulty, the sensibility at work in these fictions boldly insists on the enduring power of love. D’Ambrosio conjures a world that is fearfully inhospitable, darkly humorous, and touched by glory; here are characters, tested by every kind of failure, who struggle to remain human, whose lives have been sharpened rather than numbed by adversity, whose apprehension of truth and beauty has been deepened rather than defeated by their troubles. Many writers speak of the abyss. Charles D’Ambrosio writes as if he is inside of it, gazing upward, and the gaze itself is redemptive, a great yearning ache, poignant and wondrous, equal parts grit and grace.",3.94,256,Hardcover, ,118,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145007.The_Dead_Fish_Museum,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145007.The_Dead_Fish_Museum

For a generation that was embodying the ebbing of the tide of faith, it articulated the huge intellectual and cultural shifts that had resulted in most people no longer having any connection with official religion. For many who, whilst still going to church, glimpsed horizons wider than those offered by traditional forms of religious thought, The Sea of Faith offered liberating freedom, encouraging them to have minds of their own in matters of faith. For many more who had abandoned the church, it once again made the wider question a matter of serious and worthwhile concern. Today, the Sea of Faith networks exist in Britain, Australia and New Zealand and the movement is known around much of the world. The Sea of Faith is rightly acknowledged as one of the most influential theological texts of recent years.

(London),mul,false,"Plato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought.<br /><br />In <i>Laches, Charmides, </i> and <i>Lysis, </i> Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. <i>Protagoras, Ion, </i> and <i>Meno</i> discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In <i>Gorgias, </i> Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The <i>Apology</i> (not a dialogue), <i>Crito, Euthyphro, </i> and the unforgettable <i>Phaedo</i> relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous <i>Symposium</i> and <i>Phaedrus, </i> written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. <i>Cratylus</i> discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the <i>Republic, </i> concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues <i>Euthydemus</i> deals with philosophy; metaphysical <i>Parmenides</i> is about general concepts and absolute being; <i>Theaetetus</i> reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, <i>Sophist</i> deals with not-being; <i>Politicus</i> with good and bad statesmanship and governments; <i>Philebus</i> with what is good. The <i>Timaeus</i> seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished <i>Critias</i> treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of <i>Laws</i> (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.<br /><br />The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.",4.32,480,Hardcover,Loeb Classical LIbrary #123 (Greek and English),4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145211.Theaetetus_Sophist,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145211.Theaetetus_Sophist

Ses lecteurs vont pouvoir ensuite descendre ce grand fleuve aux lenteurs asiatiques et suivre la romancière danstous les méandres du delta, dans la moiteur des rizières, dans les secrets ombreux où elle a développé l’incantation répétitive et obsédante de ses livres, de ses films, de son théâtre. Au sens propre, Duras est ici remontée à ses sources, à sa “ scène fondamentale ” : ce moment où, vers 1930, sur un bac traversant un bras du Mékong, un Chinois richissime s’approche d’une petite Blanche de quinze ans qu’il va aimer. Il faut lire les plus beaux morceaux de <i>L’Amant</i> à haute voix. On percevra mieux ainsi le rythme, la scansion, la respiration intime de la prose, qui sont les subtils secrets de l’écrivain. Dès les premières lignes du récit éclatent l’art et le savoir-faire de Duras, ses libertés, ses défis, les conquêtes de trente années pour parvenir à écrire cette langue allégée, neutre, rapide et lancinante à la fois capable de saisir toutes les nuances, d’aller à la vitesse exacte de la pensée et des images. Un extrême réalisme (on voit le fleuve, on entend les cris de Cholon derrière les persiennes dans la garçonnière du Chinois), et en même temps une sorte de rêve éveillé, de vie rêvée, un cauchemar de vie : cette prose à nulle autre pareille est d’une formidable efficacité. À la fois la modernité, la vraie, et des singularités qui sont hors du temps, des styles, de la mode. »<br />-- <i>François Nourissier (Le Figaro Magazine, 20 octobre 1984)</i><br /><br />« L’histoire est sombre, à demi-muette, jamais encore racontée ni écrite, inavouable en quelque sorte. C’est l’histoire vraie, si l’expression a un sens, celle où les romans, le théâtre, les films sont venus puiser, les uns après les autres. La source donc, sans fond ni forme, insaisissable : cette histoire plus romanesque, pourrait-on dire, que toutes les fictions qui en sont dérivées, plus silencieuse, plus absolue, exemplaire.<br />Au commencement, une fille de quinze ans et demi, presque une enfant, dans un bac sur le Mékong. Ou plutôt, au commencement, une photo qui n’a pas été prise, celle d’un moment décisif qui fonde une manière de vivre et d’écrire. Un tournant, dit-on ; ici, une traversée. La photo d’une petite blanche, pensionnaire à Saïgon, l’écrivain à quinze ans, passant d’une rive à l’autre du Mékong. Le corps est frêle, sinon chétif, les cheveux nattés, la tenue, insolite, mélange de pauvreté et d’extravagance : une robe informe, des chaussures de bal en lamé or et un chapeau d’homme, “ un feutre souple couleur bois de rose au large ruban noir. ” Sous ce chapeau, un visage enfantin et précoce “ voyant ”, prémonitoire de ce qui l’attend de l’autre côté du fleuve, la vie, la jouissance, “ l’expriment. ”<br />Un homme est là, qui la regarde, fumant une cigarette près de sa limousine noire et de son chauffeur. II est riche, jeune. Il est chinois. Il sera <i>L’Amant</i>. Non pas “ un ”, parmi d’autres, ni même “ mon ”, mais “ le ”, par essence ; par définition et préfiguration. <i>L’Amant</i>, celui qui donne son titre au livre, comme si seule sa position était claire et désignée. Il est celui qui aime, qui donne le plaisir, qui voudrait se marier, dont le père interdit la passion ; celui qui prodigue l’argent que “ la petite ” attend de lui, qu’elle donne à sa mère en juste réparation de la ruine familiale. Elle, de son côté ne dit rien, elle ne sait pas, impuissante à qualifier ce qu’elle vit. Sans mots d’amour à l’égard de <i>L’Amant</i> ; muette auprès de sa famille qui ignorera la vraie nature de cette relation ; silencieuse dans la colonie blanche que son comportement scandalise. Toute entière donc du côté de cette mère et de ces frères murés dans un “ silence génial ” ; proche, déjà, de ces femmes de l’œuvre, absentes à elles-mêmes, traversées par la parole comme si elle leur était étrangère, suspendues dans l’attente, le ravissement, la folie : Lol. V. Stein, Anne-Marie Stretter, Alissa et les autres, figures contradictoires de l’ignorance et du savoir, du manque et de la puissance.<br />Serait-ce donc parce que certains mots n’ont jamais été dits, empêchés par une passion ancienne et terrible pour la mère, qu’ils ont pris dans l’œuvre tant de force, qu’ils ont formé ces phrases détachées, posées comme des objets dans l’espace, flottant de cette manière souveraine, somnambulique, presque impersonnelle qui est la leur ? Phrases d’un poids si particulier, si matériel, qu’elles peuvent se substituer aux images d’un film. Sur l’écran noir de L’Homme atlantique, les mots seuls, parce que dans l’expérience fondamentale, eux seuls auront manquer.<br />Ces mots, les voici dans <i>L’Amant</i>, retrouvés comme on le dit de sa langue. Non pas qu’il y soit dit ce qui ne peut pas l’être – je t’aime, ou, elle l’aime, selon cette oscillation entre la troisième et la première personne qui est un des propres du livre – mais parce que l’écriture a cessé de vouloir se faire “ autour ”. Et qu’en n’allant pour ainsi dire nulle part, tout à coup, comme distraitement, elle se trouve. “ J’ai beaucoup écrit de ces gens de ma famille, mais tandis que je le faisais, ils vivaient encore, la mère et les frères, et j’ai écrit autour d’eux, autour de ces choses sans aller jusqu’à elles. ” Ici, la volonté n’est plus de ressaisir. De refaire à travers la fiction le monde comme on voudrait qu’il fût. Plus de crispation, plus rien de cet acharnement familial à construire des barrages, à obtenir réparation.<br />L’histoire est terminée, voici l’oubli qui éloigne de cette mère : “ c’est fini, je ne me souviens plus. C’est pourquoi, j’écris si facile d’elle, maintenant, si long, si étiré, elle est devenue écriture courante. ” L’écriture atteint l’abandon de l’archer qui a perdu jusqu’à l’idée du but. La main s’ouvre comme à son insu, lâchant la corde. Tir sans visée. La flèche a volé jusqu’au centre.<br />De là vient la grâce qui donne à ce livre son évidence inimitable. Son rayonnement, cette nécessité interne qui porte les phrases, les fait apparaître dans leur torsion, leurs raccourcis, leurs mouvements inattendus, comme ce qu’elles ne peuvent être et qu’elles sont pourtant : naturelles.<br />Les mots retrouvés, l’expérience redécouvre en effet ce qu’elle aura été, infinie, totale. Un monde. À l’écrire de cette façon magnifiquement déréglée, libre, audacieuse, disparate, fragment après fragment, avec la même “ inconvenance fondamentale ” qui porte la petite à se vouloir en chaussures de bal et feutre d’homme, tout entre peu à peu dans le livre. Les temps, les lieux, la violence familiale et sa grandeur, les méfaits du frère aîné, la mort du petit, les bruits de Saïgon derrière le store, la fournaise, les oiseaux, la pension, Hélène Lagonelle, écho anticipé de Lol. V. Stein, d’autres femmes plus tard à Paris sous l’occupation, figures déplacées dans cette histoire et pourtant à leur place puisqu’ici, dans l’écriture comme dans la jouissance, “ tout est bon, il n’y a pas de déchets, les déchets sont recouverts, tout va dans le torrent, dans la force du désir. ” Tout est là, oui, le plus complexe et le plus contradictoire, dans leur nudité, au fil d’une écriture qui paraît d’autant maîtresse d’elle qu’elle est plus abandonnée, plus ingénue. Semblable à cette fille de quinze ans qui passe le fleuve à la rencontre de ce dont son visage porte déjà la trace, l’amour. »<br />-- <i>Marianne Alphant (Libération, 4 septembre 1984)</i><br /><br />« On se doutait bien qu’un jour on finirait par y aborder, au cœur de la Durasie ; que cette longue navigation de Gibraltar à Hiroshima, du Square à Calcutta, de romans en films, devait nous conduire là, à la caverne mère, à la grotte première, au cœur de la Durasie. On n’était pas trop pressé d’y parvenir, parce que cette contrée centrale, on la voyait toujours de partout affleurer, on y était déjà presque. Seulement presque, pourtant. Mais même quand il s’agissait de gens, de personnages, d’autres, les descriptions géographico-sentimentales des terres de Durasie étaient constamment écrites avec un je majuscule, un je qui s’affrontait seulement aux deux ou trois protagonistes fondamentaux, la Mère, les Frères et, sur les grands chemins de la souveraine folie, à une mendiante qui fut reine, en route vers Calcutta. Il serait temps plus tard de dire “ je ” de plein fouet, de mettre toute sa mise sur la mémoire nue. En attendant ce jour (il est venu avec <i>L’Amant</i>), Marguerite s’en retournait en sourdine en haute Durasie, sur les bords du Mékong, et elle en rapportait de magnifiques ou déconcertantes dépouilles, les portraits-souvenirs d’une Mère Courage érigée en barrage contre le Pacifique ? I’Eden-Cinéma de la mémoire, Savannaketh-en-lndochine et Savannah-Bay-en-Jadis, et ces romans, ces pièces, ces films (quelquefois les trois à la fois) où on rencontre beaucoup de héros et d’héroïnes mais dont le personnage central est, avant tout, une certaine façon de parler, I’inimitable ton de Marguerite Duras.<br />Cette fois-ci, plus de rôles, plus de jeux avec le je. L’auteur se dénonce actrice, et si l’imaginaire resurgit, ses pans de brumes matinales, ses mirages de midi, ses ombres du crépuscule, c’est comme dans les jours de notre mémoire, où ce que nous sommes fait parfois vaciller ce que nous fûmes, où les éclipses de passé et les derniers quartiers de lune du présent troublent souvent le ciel nocturne. Entre la fin de son enfance, son adolescence et l’orée de sa jeunesse, Marguerite Duras se raconte Marguerite Duras, avec un intérêt vorace et détaché pour Marguerite, avec cet amour-passion de soi qui a la férocité tranquille des passions sûres d’elles-mêmes, si passionnées qu’elles peuvent supporter gaiement de s’entendre se dire toutes les vérités pas bonnes à dire, se traiter de tous les noms avec une tendresse tranquille, se décrire avec “ ce visage de I’alcool que j’ai attrapé dans l’âge moyen de ma vie ”, et se regarder dans les vertiges de la démesure avec le calme artisanal du peintre qui mesure ses moyens et calcule ses effets, afin d’obtenir avec précision l’imprécise sensation du délire. Marguerite Duras aura beaucoup aimé, entre autres choses, elle-même et la prose française. Elle les soumet, l’autre et l’une, aux épreuves de l’amour, qui ne sont pas toujours douceur.<br />Il ne faut pas raconter <i>L’Amant</i>, pas davantage qu’on ne doit raconter un poème, parce que cette tranche de vie, ce noyau d’autobiographie est, comme tout ce qu’écrit Duras, construit comme un poème. Qui veut résumer un poème, il lui reste dans le creux de la main la cendre d’un argument, les débris d’un sujet. L’amour-conflit, I’amour-combat de la petite Marguerite pour sa mère, cette folle de Saigon, le grand frère voyou et le petit frère mort si tôt ; I’Amant milliardaire chinois, auquel on dirait qu’elle demande d’être celui qui l’arrachera à l’engluement dans le Grand Fond Malempia de la tribu natale, Marguerite Duras traite ces revenants en sorceresse, en évocatrice-conjuratrice. Elle les chante et les enchante avec les procédés qu’elle a mis au point pour faire surgir le poème dans le tissu de la prose : répétitions et retour d’images-rimes, litanies avec refrains, construction en écho et mouvements de spirale, ellipses et ruptures méditées de ton. Insidieuse avec les mots comme peut l’être le Wagner de Tristan avec les leitmotive. Violente, des tripes à la gorge, comme peut l’être Edith Piaf avec “ Je ne regrette rien ”. Émouvante comme le tremblement dans la voix de la vérité affrontée de la détresse transmuée en musique.<br />Elle se regarde avoir été la jeune fille qui adorait-haïssait, embrassait-repoussait sa mère, la petite “ dévergondée ” que la grande limousine noire et le chauffeur en costume de coton blanc ramenaient en pleine nuit vers le dortoir du lycée, au retour de la garçonnière de <i>L’Amant</i>. Elle se regarde avec un étonnement à la fois émerveillé et distant, une glorieuse gourmandise narcissique. La nuit charrie les eaux sans fin des fleuves d’Asie, la rumeur du quartier chinois monte à travers les lattes des stores. Et la petite sauvagesse émergeant de l’enfance a déjà appris ce qui sera l’irréfragable noyau de sa vision du monde : qu’il n’y a pas de corps simples, que tout est double, ambivalent, contrarié, que la Mère c’est “ la saleté, ma mère, mon amour ” que l’amour c’est “ tu me tues, tu me fais du bien ”, que dans le cœur de l’homme un adjectif appelle aussitôt son contraire, et que tout être est l’agent double de lui-même.<br />Qui a parlé d’impudeur ? Personne ? C’est bien. Car dans sa nudité – la nudité de l’émotion à sa source –, la narratrice est strictement vêtue par la haute couture de cette langue qu’on ne parle qu’en Durasie. Une parole dont le projet est (et parfois, dirait-on, à n’importe quel prix) de ne pas donner une seule seconde le sentiment du déjà-entendu, du déjà-lu. Cette torsion constante de la phrase, cette gymnastique volontaire de rafraîchissement du style, ce passage du naturel bouleversant au charabia cérémonieux, c’est Duras tout entière à la langue attachée. Cela donne parfois, mais rarement, la chair de poule du jargon trop précieusement abstrait : “ L’ambiguïté déterminante de l’image, elle est dans ce chapeau. ” Mais cela donne aussi, et plus souvent, le beau frisson d’une simplicité inouïe : “ L’air était bleu, on le prenait dans la main. ” Ou bien cette vision d’un navire appareillant puis prenant le large : “ La terre emportait la forme du bateau dans sa courbure. ” Et encore, par exemple, ce regard d’oiseau de haut vol sur les bras du Mékong : “ Dans la platitude à perte de vue, ces fleuves, ils vont vite, ils versent comme si la terre penchait. ”<br />Car, s’il y a un amant que jamais Marguerite Duras n’oublia ni ne trahit, c’est l’autre-passion de sa vie, son métier d’écrivain, son art, I’usage émerveillé de sa parole. »<br />-- <i>Claude Roy (Le Nouvel Observateur, 31 août 1984)</i><br /><br />« (…) L’écriture de Duras ressemble à celle de l’amour. Je ne parle pas de la caresse soyeuse des phrases, ni des brassées du sentimental, ni de la nostalgie bariolée (tout ce qu’a ramassé le fleuve depuis le Tonlé-Sap). Non, je parle de tout ce qui s’entend sortir de là, de ce qu’a fait sourdre d’un simple récit autobiographique l’auteur de L’Homme assis dans le couloir et de La Maladie de la mort : une tenue stridente de l’infraction. On dit d’un art qu’il est “ consommé ” alors que précisément personne n’en voulait, ce qui veut dire qu’il arrive d’un seul coup, que rien n’avait averti qu’il arrivait, et puis aussi qu’il est si subitement là, la seule chose que personne n’attend ni ne demande : I’art. Ce n’est après qu’il est art... qu’on le consomme comme si de rien n’était. Mais avant, avant qu’il soit là d’un seul coup et que tout le monde le trouve normal, non seulement il n’existe pas, pas encore, mais il est une infraction intenable. Après on le case et on dit “ Tiens ! ” en le voyant dans un musée. Le sujet de ce livre n’est évidemment pas le fait qu’une jeune fille de famille coloniale fait l’amour avec un riche Chinois et qu’elle s’en souvient quelques décennies plus tard. Le sujet c’est le rejet, le silence, le meurtre déguisé et différé de l’écriture, la mère qui n’entend pas que sa fille veut écrire, I’arrachement, I’effondrement, la mort, la fuite, la défiguration, la peur (il est fait plusieurs fois écho à La Nuit du chasseur, le film de Laughton), la punition, la mort. La mort un peu partout (“ Je suis devant la porte fermée ”), et toutes les tueries qu’elle implique avant d’être là. »<br />-- <i>Denis Roche (Le Matin de Paris, 4 septembre 1984)</i><br /><br />« Par je ne sais quelle générosité qui est le signe des grands, I’auteur ne nous donne pas à contempler du dehors une belle histoire dont nous serions exclus, incapables, mais nous offre l’illusion que ce pourrait être la nôtre, que la nôtre mériterait le même embellissement indécis, que ça y est, elle en est éclairée du dedans, de cette lumière sans source que diffusent les brouillards. »<br />-- <i>Bertrand Poirot-Delpech (Le Monde, 1984)</i><br /><br />",3.74,142,Paperback,First Edition,185,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145542.L_Amant,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145542.L_Amant

Out of this experience, Koestler wrote Darkness at Noon, his most acclaimed work in the United States, about a man arrested and executed in a Communist prison.<br /><br />Dialogue with Death is Koestler’s riveting account of the fall of Málaga to rebel forces, his surreal arrest, and his three months facing death from a prison cell.

For these two teenagers - brother and sister, black and white - the 1980s were a trial by fire.<br /><br />In this memoir, Scheeres takes us from the familiar Midwest, a land of cottonwood trees and trailer parks, to a place beyond her imagining. At home, the Scheeres kids must endure the usual trials of adolescence - high-school hormones, incessant bullying, and the deep-seated restlessness of social misfits everywhere - under the shadow of virulent racism neither knows how to contend with. When they start to crack (or fight back), they are packed off to Escuela Caribe. This brutal, prison-like ""Christian boot camp"" demands that its inhabitants repent for their sins - sins that few of them are aware of having committed. Julia and David's determination to make it though with heart and soul intact is told here with immediacy, candor, sparkling humor, and not an ounce of malice. Jesus Land is, on every page, a keenly moving ode to the sustaining power of love, and rebellion, and the dream of a perfect family.",3.98,363,Paperback, ,1448,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146064.Jesus_Land,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146064.Jesus_Land

W. Norton  Company,en-US,false,"Michelle Goldberg, a senior political reporter for <i>Salon.com</i>, has been covering the intersection of politics and ideology for years. Before the 2004 election, and during the ensuing months when many Americans were trying to understand how an administration marked by cronyism, disregard for the national budget, and poorly disguised self-interest had been reinstated, Goldberg traveled through the heartland of a country in the grips of a fevered religious radicalism: the America of our time. From the classroom to the mega-church to the federal court, she saw how the growing influence of dominionism-the doctrine that Christians have the right to rule nonbelievers-is threatening the foundations of democracy.<br /><br /><br />In <i>Kingdom Coming</i>, Goldberg demonstrates how an increasingly bellicose fundamentalism is gaining traction throughout our national life, taking us on a tour of the parallel right-wing evangelical culture that is buoyed by Republican political patronage. Deep within the red zones of a divided America, we meet military retirees pledging to seize the nation in Christ's name, perfidious congressmen courting the confidence of neo-confederates and proponents of theocracy, and leaders of federally funded programs offering Jesus as the solution to the country's social problems.<br /><br /><br />With her trenchant interviews and the telling testimonies of the people behind this movement, Goldberg gains access into the hearts and minds of citizens who are striving to remake the secular Republic bequeathed by our founders into a Christian nation run according to their interpretation of scripture. In her examination of the ever-widening divide between believers and nonbelievers, Goldberg illustrates the subversive effect of this conservative stranglehold nationwide. In an age when faith rather than reason is heralded and the values of the Enlightenment are threatened by a mystical nationalism claiming divine sanction, <i>Kingdom Coming</i> brings us face to face with the irrational forces that are remaking much of America.",3.96,272,Paperback, ,102,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146071.Kingdom_Coming,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146071.Kingdom_Coming

He shows Tintin his collection of seals, including one which belonged to the Syldavian King Ottokar IV. Tintin then discovers that he and Alembick are under surveillance by some strange men. Tintin's flat is even bombed in an attempt to kill him. Suspecting a Syldavian connection, Tintin offers to accompany Alembick to Syldavia for research.<br /><br />On the plane Tintin begins to suspect his companion. The Alembick travelling with him doesn't smoke and doesn't seem to need the spectacles he wears, while the Alembick he first met smoked heavily and had very poor eyesight. During a layover, Tintin fakes a fall and grabs Alembick's beard, thinking it is false and Alembick is an imposter. However, it is (for Alembick) painfully real. Tintin decides to let the matter drop but then, while flying over Syldavia, it is the pilot of the plane who opens a trap door and Tintin drops out, landing in a haywagon.<br /><br />Tintin has a hunch that a plot is afoot to steal the sceptre of King Ottokar IV. In Syldavia, the reigning King must possess the sceptre to rule or he will be forced to abdicate. Every year he rides in a parade during St. Vladimir's Day carrying it, while the people sing the national anthem. Tintin succeeds in warning the reigning King, Muskar XII, despite the efforts of the conspirators. He and the King rush to the royal treasure room to find Alembick, the royal photographer and some guards unconscious and the sceptre missing.<br /><br />Tintin's friends Thomson and Thompson are summoned to investigate but their theory on how the sceptre was stolen proves bad and painful for them. Later on, Tintin notices a spring cannon in a toy shop and this gives him the clue. Professor Alembick had asked for some photographs to be taken of the sceptre, but the camera was a spring cannon in disguise, which allowed him to catapult it out of the castle into a nearby forest.<br /><br />Searching the forest, Tintin spots the sceptre being found by agents of the neighbouring country, Borduria. Following them all the way to the border, he wrests the sceptre from them. In the wallet of one of the thieves he discovers papers that show that the theft of the sceptre was just part of a major plan for the taking over of Syldavia by their long-time political rival, Borduria.<br /><br />Tintin steals a Me-109 from a Bordurian airfield (whose squadron is being kept ready to take part in the envisioned ""Anschluss"" of Syldavia) to fly it back to the King in time. He is shot down by the Syldavians who have naturally opened fire on an enemy aircraft violating their airspace. He manages to make the rest of the journey by foot.<br /><br />Meanwhile the Interior Minister informs the King that rumours have been spreading that the sceptre has been stolen and that there have been riots against local Bordurian businesses, acts which would justify a Bordurian takeover of the country. The King is about to abdicate when Snowy runs in with the sceptre (which had fallen out of Tintin's pocket).<br /><br />Tintin then gives the King the papers he took from the man who stole the sceptre. They prove that the plot was masterminded by Müsstler, leader of the Iron Guard, a local political party. The King takes action by having Müsstler and his associates arrested and the army mobilised along the Bordurian frontier. In response, the Bordurian leader pulls his own troops back from the border, though he stresses his own country's ""desire for peace"" and criticises Syldavia's ""strange"" behaviour.<br /><br />The next day is St. Vladimir's Day and Tintin is made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican, the first non-Syldavian to receive such an honour. Further inquiries by the authorities reveal that, in a classic Ruritanian plot device, Professor Alembick is one of a pair of identical twins: Hector Alembick was kidnapped and replaced with his brother Alfred who left for Syldavia in his place.<br /><br />Tintin and Snowy return home by a flying boat with Thomson and Thompson, who suffer momentary panic when the aircraft appears to be falling into the sea at the end of the flight. The reader is treated to a rare ""wink to the camera"" from Tintin, who points out their error, and they laugh about it so much that they do indeed fall into the sea as they disembark.<br /><br />",4.02,62,Hardcover, ,141,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146108.King_Ottokar_s_Sceptre,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146108.King_Ottokar_s_Sceptre

Tintin, Calculus and Haddock soon become embroiled in the accusations, and, travelling to San Theodoros to clear their names, find themselves caught in a trap laid by their old enemy, Colonel Sponsz, who has been sent by the East Bloc nation of Borduria to assist Tapioca. Sponsz has concocted the conspiracy of which Tintin and his friends are accused in a plot to wreak revenge upon them for humiliating him in The Calculus Affair. Escaping, Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus join Alcazar and his small band of guerrillas, the Picaros, in the jungle near an Arumbaya Indian village.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in a show trial orchestrated by Sponsz, Castafiore is sentenced to life imprisonment and the Thompsons are ordered to be executed by firing squad. Tintin enlists Alcazar's help in freeing his friends, but upon arrival at his jungle headquarters, finds that Alcazar's men have become demoralised drunkards since Tapioca started dropping copious quantities of alcohol near their camp. Additionally, Alcazar is continually henpecked by his shrewish wife Peggy, who nags him constantly about his failure to achieve a successful revolution. Fortunately, Calculus has invented a pill which will make alcohol unpalatable to anyone who ingests it (which he proves to have tested on Haddock, much to the latter's ire). Tintin offers to use the pill to cure the Picaros of their alcoholism if Alcazar agrees to make the overthrow of Tapioca bloodless. Alcazar reluctantly agrees, and as his men are cured, Jolyon Wagg arrives with his musical troupe the Jolly Follies, who intend to perform at the upcoming carnival in San Theodoros. Alcazar — with a little advice from Tintin — launches an assault on Tapioca's palace during the carnival by 'borrowing' the troupe's costumes and sneaking his men into the capital. He topples Tapioca, but on Tintin's urging, does not execute him, as is tradition; Tapioca is instead forced to publicly surrender his powers to Alcazar and is exiled, while Sponsz is sent back to Borduria.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Thomson and Thompson are due to be shot on the same day as the carnival (although as naive as ever in their observations, the detectives show courage by refusing to be blindfolded). Tintin and Haddock reach the state prison in time to prevent the executions from taking place. Castafiore, her maid and her pianist are also released, and Alcazar can finally give his wife the palace he has promised. With everything back in order (or not), Tintin and his friends leave. As they fly home, Tintin and Haddock express gratitude about being able to go home, showing a more weary attitude towards travel than in earlier books.<br /><br />The second to last panel shows a final, skeptical political message: as under Tapioca, the city slums are filled with wretched, starving people and patrolled by indifferent police. Nothing is different, except that a Viva Tapioca sign has been changed to read Viva Alcazar, demonstrating Hergé's view that even if regimes change, conditions do not improve.<br />",4.02,64,Paperback, ,119,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146160.Tintin_and_the_Picaros,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146160.Tintin_and_the_Picaros

Food in America is cheap and abundant, yet the vast majority of it is diminished in terms of flavor and nutrition, anonymous and mysterious after being shipped thousands of miles and passing through inscrutable supply chains, and controlled by multinational corporations. In our system of globalized food commodities, convenience replaces quality and a connection to the source of our food. Most of us know almost nothing about how our food is grown or produced, where it comes from, and what health value it really has. It is food as pure corporate commodity. We all deserve much better than that. <br /> <br /> In <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved</em>, author Sandor Ellix Katz (<em>Wild Fermentation</em>, Chelsea Green 2003) profiles grassroots activists who are taking on Big Food, creating meaningful alternatives, and challenging the way many Americans think about food.

A gripping hour-by-hour account told through the eyes of the hunted and the hunters, this is history as you've never read it before.<br /><br />The murder of Abraham Lincoln set off the greatest manhunt in American history -- the pursuit and capture of John Wilkes Booth. From April 14 to April 26, 1865, the assassin led Union cavalry and detectives on a wild twelve-day chase through the streets of Washington, D.C., across the swamps of Maryland, and into the forests of Virginia, while the nation, still reeling from the just-ended Civil War, watched in horror and sadness. <br /><br />At the very center of this story is John Wilkes Booth, America's notorious villain. A Confederate sympathizer and a member of a celebrated acting family, Booth threw away his fame and wealth for a chance to avenge the South's defeat. For almost two weeks, he confounded the manhunters, slipping away from their every move and denying them the justice they sought. <br /><br />Based on rare archival materials, obscure trial transcripts, and Lincoln's own blood relics, <i>Manhunt</i> is a fully documented work and a fascinating tale of murder, intrigue, and betrayal.

A true believer--and one of only two Westerners permitted to enroll at Beijing University--her education included wielding a pneumatic drill at the Number One Machine Tool Factory. In the name of the Revolution, she renounced rock &amp; roll, hauled pig manure in the paddy fields, and turned in a fellow student who sought her help in getting to the United States. She also met and married the only American draft dodger from the Vietnam War to seek asylum in China.<br /><br /><i>Red China Blues</i> is Wong's startling--and ironic--memoir of her rocky six-year romance with Maoism (which crumbled as she became aware of the harsh realities of Chinese communism); her dramatic firsthand account of the devastating Tiananmen Square uprising; and her engaging portrait of the individuals and events she covered as a correspondent in China during the tumultuous era of capitalist reform under Deng Xiaoping. In a frank, captivating, deeply personal narrative she relates the horrors that led to her disillusionment with the ""worker's paradise."" And through the stories of the people--an unhappy young woman who was sold into marriage, China's most famous dissident, a doctor who lengthens penises--Wong reveals long-hidden dimensions of the world's most populous nation.<br /><br />In setting out to show readers in the Western world what life is like in China, and why we should care, she reacquaints herself with the old friends--and enemies of her radical past, and comes to terms with the legacy of her ancestral homeland.",4.07,416,Paperback, ,230,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146335.Red_China_Blues,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146335.Red_China_Blues

  <p><br />When Rudd, a troubled teenager, embarks on a school project, he runs across a series of articles from the 1902 <i>New York Times</i> chronicling a vicious murder committed by the grandson of Brigham Young. Delving deeply into the Mormon ritual of blood sacrifice used in the murders, Rudd, along with his newly discovered half-brother, Lael, becomes swept up in the psychological and atavistic effects of this violent, antique ritual.</p>
  <p><br />As the past and the present become an increasingly tangled knot, Rudd is found at the scene of a multiple murder at a remote campsite with minor injuries and few memories. Lyndi, the daughter of the victims, tries to help Rudd recover his memory and, together, they find a strength unique to survivors of terrible tragedies. But Rudd, desperate to protect Lyndi and unable to let the past be still, tries to manipulate their Mormon wedding ceremony to trick the priests (and God) by giving himself and Lyndi new secret namesâ€”names that match the killer and the victim in the one hundred-year-old murder. The nightmare has just begun . . .</p>

Replete with the brutality, primordial waste, and savage blankness familiar to readers of his earlier works, Evenson's Kafkaesque allegories entice the mind while stubbornly disordering it. In the title story an obsessive consciousness folds back on itself, creating a vertiginous mélange of Poe and Borges, both horrific and metaphysical. Here, as in ""Moran's Mexico,"" and ""Greenhouse,"" the solitary nature of reading and writing leads characters beyond human limits, making the act of putting words to paper a monstrous violation opening onto madness. In ""White Square"" the representation of humans by dimly colored shapes confirms our feeling that something lies behind these words, while seeming to mock us with the futility of seeking it. Evenson's enigmatic names-Thurm, Bein, Hatcher, Burlun-placeable landscapes, and barren rooms all combine to create a semblance of conceptual abstraction, as though the material universe had come to exist inside someone's head.<br /><br />Small wonder that Evenson's work has attracted so much attention among philosophers, literary critics, and other speculative intelligences, for it continuously projects a tantalizing absence, as though there were some key or code that, if only we knew it, would illuminate everything.

Celebrate with this anniversary edition that features an eye-catching commemorative red sticker. This classic poetry collection, which is both outrageously funny and profound, has been the most beloved of Shel Silverstein's poetry books for generations.<br /><br />Where the sidewalk ends, Shel Silverstein's world begins. There you'll meet a boy who turns into a TV set and a girl who eats a whale. The Unicorn and the Bloath live there, and so does Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who will not take the garbage out. It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.<br /><br />Shel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings is one of Parent &amp; Child magazine's 100 Greatest Books for Kids. School Library Journal said, ""Silverstein has an excellent sense of rhythm and rhyme and a good ear for alliteration and assonance that make these poems a pleasure to read aloud.""<br /><br />Shel Silverstein's incomparable career as a children's book author and illustrator began with Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back. In 1964, Shel's creativity continued to flourish as four more books were published in the same year—Don't Bump the Glump!, A Giraffe and a Half, Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros?, and the beloved classic The Giving Tree.

It was a crucial friendship, and a unique one--a president and a prime minister spending enormous amounts of time together (113 days during the war) and exchanging nearly two thousand messages. Amid cocktails, cigarettes, and cigars, they met, often secretly, in places as far-flung as Washington, Hyde Park, Casablanca, and Teheran, talking to each other of war, politics, the burden of command, their health, their wives, and their children.<br /><br />Born in the nineteenth century and molders of the twentieth and twenty-first, Roosevelt and Churchill had much in common. Sons of the elite, students of history, politicians of the first rank, they savored power. In their own time both men were underestimated, dismissed as arrogant, and faced skeptics and haters in their own nations--yet both magnificently rose to the central challenges of the twentieth century. Theirs was a kind of love story, with an emotional Churchill courting an elusive Roosevelt. The British prime minister, who rallied his nation in its darkest hour, standing alone against Adolf Hitler, was always somewhat insecure about his place in FDR's affections--which was the way Roosevelt wanted it. A man of secrets, FDR liked to keep people off balance, including his wife, Eleanor, his White House aides--and Winston Churchill.<br /><br />Confronting tyranny and terror, Roosevelt and Churchill built a victorious alliance amid cataclysmic events and occasionally conflicting interests. Franklin and Winston is also the story of their marriages and their families, two clans caught up in the most sweeping global conflict in history.<br /><br />Meacham's new sources--including unpublished letters of FDR's great secret love, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, the papers of Pamela Churchill Harriman, and interviews with the few surviving people who were in FDR and Churchill's joint company--shed fresh light on the characters of both men as he engagingly chronicles the hours in which they decided the course of the struggle.<br /><br />Hitler brought them together; later in the war, they drifted apart, but even in the autumn of their alliance, the pull of affection was always there. Charting the personal drama behind the discussions of strategy and statecraft, Meacham has written the definitive account of the most remarkable friendship of the modern age.",4.11,490,Paperback, ,374,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147537.Franklin_and_Winston,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147537.Franklin_and_Winston

Benjamin Franklin, perhaps <i>the </i>pivotal figure in colonial and revolutionary America, comes vividly to life in this masterly biography.<br /><br />Wit, diplomat, scientist, philosopher, businessman, inventor, and bon vivant, Benjamin Franklin was in every respect America’s first Renaissance man. From penniless runaway to highly successful printer, from ardently loyal subject of Britain to architect of an alliance with France that ensured America’s independence, Franklin went from obscurity to become one of the world’s most admired figures, whose circle included the likes of Voltaire, Hume, Burke, and Kant. Drawing on previously unpublished letters and a host of other sources, acclaimed historian H. W. Brands has written a thoroughly engaging biography of the eighteenth-century genius.

He has been variously called a New Age surrealist, son of the New York School, a comically tragic poet who knows the pain at the heart of a joke, a lunatic, a stuffed bunny, and a fire engine of the Romantic imagination. But if these things are true, they come at us in a unique, compelling, warm, funny, poignant, and sometimes cracked voice. Each of his poems is an enactment, a representation of psychic life as it moves through modes of argument, autobiography, and conventional lyric impulses while making room for textual experimentation.

With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap.

Beginning each chapter with a ""bumper sticker"" slogan (""If it feels good, do it""; ""God said it, I believe it, that settles it;"" ""When in Rome?""), he then moves on to examine the complex questions, conclusions and assumptions that lie at its heart. Wilkens acquaints students with the vast array of classic and contemporary approaches to ethics: cultural relativism, emotivism, behaviourism, hedonism, ethical egoism, atheistic existentialism, utilitarianism, categorical imperative, hierarchicalism, situation ethics, theistic existentialism, theological voluntarism, and natural law ethics. For each system, his thorough introduction explores its popular ""bumper sticker"" expression, its core assumptions and basic elements, the questions that give rise to it, and its strengths and weaknesses.

According to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a judge like this can maneuver through earlier cases to achieve the desired aim--distinguishing one prior case on his left, straight-arming another one on his right, high-stepping away from another precedent about to tackle him from the rear, until (bravo!) he reaches the goal--good law. But is this common-law mindset, which is appropriate in its place, suitable also in statutory and constitutional interpretation? In a witty and trenchant essay, Justice Scalia answers this question with a resounding negative.<br /><br /><br /> In exploring the neglected art of statutory interpretation, Scalia urges that judges resist the temptation to use legislative intention and legislative history. In his view, it is incompatible with democratic government to allow the meaning of a statute to be determined by what the judges think the lawgivers meant rather than by what the legislature actually promulgated. Eschewing the judicial lawmaking that is the essence of common law, judges should interpret statutes and regulations by focusing on the text itself. Scalia then extends this principle to constitutional law. He proposes that we abandon the notion of an everchanging Constitution and pay attention to the Constitution's original meaning. Although not subscribing to the strict constructionism that would prevent applying the Constitution to modern circumstances, Scalia emphatically rejects the idea that judges can properly smuggle in new rights or deny old rights by using the Due Process Clause, for instance. In fact, such judicial discretion might lead to the destruction of the Bill of Rights if a majority of the judges ever wished to reach that most undesirable of goals.<br /><br /><br /> This essay is followed by four commentaries by Professors Gordon Wood, Laurence Tribe, Mary Ann Glendon, and Ronald Dworkin, who engage Justice Scalia's ideas about judicial interpretation from varying standpoints. In the spirit of debate, Justice Scalia responds to these critics.",3.85,176,Paperback, ,49,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148647.A_Matter_of_Interpretation,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148647.A_Matter_of_Interpretation

The citizens of Gander met the stranded passengers with an overwhelming display of friendship and goodwill. As the passengers stepped from the airplanes, exhausted, hungry and distraught after being held on board for nearly 24 hours while security checked all of the baggage, they were greeted with a feast prepared by the townspeople. Local bus drivers who had been on strike came off the picket lines to transport the passengers to the various shelters set up in local schools and churches.

And as they move from Thursday Next to Jack Spratt’s Nursery Crimes, his audience is insatiable and growing. Now, with <i>The Fourth Bear</i>, Jack Spratt and Mary Mary take on their most dangerous case so far as a murderous cookie stalks the streets of Reading. <p> The Gingerbreadman—psychopath, sadist, genius, and killer—is on the loose. But it isn’t Jack Spratt’s case. He and Mary Mary have been demoted to Missing Persons following Jack’s poor judgment involving the poisoning of Mr. Bun the baker. Missing Persons looks like a boring assignment until a chance encounter leads them into the hunt for missing journalist Henrietta “Goldy” Hatchett, star reporter for <i>The Daily Mole</i>. Last to see her alive? The Three Bears, comfortably living out a life of rural solitude in Andersen’s wood. </p><p> But all is not what it seems. How could the bears’ porridge be at such disparate temperatures when they were poured at the same time? Why did Mr. and Mrs. Bear sleep in separate beds? Was there a fourth bear? And if there was, who was he, and why did he try to disguise Goldy’s death as a freak accident? </p><p> Jack answers all these questions and a few others besides, rescues Mary Mary from almost certain death, and finally meets the Fourth Bear and the Gingerbreadman face-to-face.</p>",4.08,382,Hardcover, ,1032,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148809.The_Fourth_Bear,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148809.The_Fourth_Bear

Not a master mason or carpenter, Filippo Brunelleschi was a goldsmith and clock maker. Over twenty-eight years, he would dedicate himself to solving puzzles of the dome's construction. In the process, he did nothing less than reinvent the field of architecture. He engineered the perfect placement of brick and stone (some among the most renowned machines of the Renaissance) to carry an estimated seventy million pounds hundreds of feet into the air, and designed the workers' platforms and routines so carefully that only one man died during the decades of construction. This drama was played out amid plagues, wars, political feuds, and the intellectual ferments of Renaissance Florence - events Ross King weaves into a story to great effect.

Hirschman</b> makes a basic distinction between alternative ways of reacting to deterioration in business firms and, in general, to dissatisfaction with organizations: one, ""exit,"" is for the member to quit the organization or for the customer to switch to the competing product, and the other, ""voice,"" is for members or customers to agitate and exert influence for change ""from within."" The efficiency of the competitive mechanism, with its total reliance on exit, is questioned for certain important situations. As exit often undercuts voice while being unable to counteract decline, loyalty is seen in the function of retarding exit and of permitting voice to play its proper role. The interplay of the three concepts turns out to illuminate a wide range of economic, social, and political phenomena.

Clarke brings the Odyssey to the conclusion millions have been awaiting.</b><br /><br />Arthur C. Clarke, the greatest prophet of the space age, at last concludes the space odyssey he embarked upon in 1968 with both the book and film of <i>2001</i>. He shared an Oscar nomination with Stanley Kubrick for the screenplay of the film, and later resolved some of its lingering enigmas in the sequels <i>2010</i>2061 - verifying Kubrick's comment, 'Arthur somehow manages to capture the hopeless yet admirable desire to know things that can really never be known.'<br /><br />Arthur C.

Thus Frank becomes a telepathic, machine-assisted inhabitant of the first years of the fourth millennium, with a lot to learn.<br /><br />The alien Monoliths have been silent since the eruption of Jupiter into a sun in A.D. 2010. Their last message was a warning: ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS EXCEPT EUROPA. ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE. But Frank Poole is an exception to the aliens' interdict. Or so he hopes. Frank has unfinished business on Europa. And perhaps Dave Bowman, his long-lost colleague from the <i>Discover</i>, is there, a thousand years older but not dead.

Her father had told her that life is an adventure, and one should make the most of it.<br /><br />Selina sees beauty everywhere, including in the fields of cabbages. She has a natural curiosity about farming and oversteps the woman's traditional role by having the audacity to ask the men questions. She soon marries Pervus DeJong, a farmer. Selina eagerly offers suggestions for operational improvements, but Pervus ignores her, preferring to use the unprofitable farming methods employed by his father.<br /><br />Though she suffers many hardships, Selina always remembers the importance of beauty, and she admires those who exercise their creative talents. She tries to instill these views in her son Dirk and fights with her husband over the need for their child to get a full education. Once Dirk finishes college and starts work, will he retain Selina's values?<br /><br /><i>So Big</i> was the first book to have the rare distinction of being the best-selling book of the year and win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.",4.03,272,Paperback, ,68,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149149.So_Big,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149149.So_Big

But behind the legend, there was a highly complex and competitive marriage–a union not of opposites but almost of twins who both inspired and tormented each other, and who were ultimately destroyed by their shared fantasies. Now in this frank, stylish, superbly written new book, Kendall Taylor tells the story of the Fitzgerald marriage as it has never been told before.<br /><br />Following the success of Fitzgerald’s first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, Scott and Zelda took New York by storm. Scott was recognized as the greatest American author of the twenties and everyone was fascinated with Zelda, his ravishing young wife, known as the model for all his flapper heroines. Ultimately it all fell apart, and Kendall Taylor tells us why. Drawing on previously suppressed material, including crucial medical records, Taylor sheds fresh light on Zelda’s depths and mysteries–her rich but largely unrealized artistic talents, her own ambitions that were unfulfilled <i>because</i> she was Mrs. F. Scott Fitzgerald, her passionate love affairs. Zelda’s contribution to Scott’s fiction, which was based on her diaries, her letters, and her life, was her only great achievement–and for that she may have paid the terrible price of her own sanity.<br /><br />In <i>Sometimes Madness Is Wisdom</i>, Kendall Taylor has created the definitive Fitzgerald biography. Written with sympathy, original insight, and dazzling style–and featuring memorable appearances from Edmund Wilson, Gertrude Stein, and Ernest Hemingway, among others–this is a stunning portrait of a marriage, an age, and a fabulous but tragic woman.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.97,480,Paperback, ,45,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150109.Sometimes_Madness_Is_Wisdom,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150109.Sometimes_Madness_Is_Wisdom

This is a two-volume work. Volume I introduces the foundations of quantum field theory. The development is fresh and logical throughout, with each step carefully motivated by what has gone before, and emphasizing the reasons why such a theory should describe nature. After a brief historical outline, the book begins anew with the principles about which we are most certain, relativity and quantum mechanics, and the properties of particles that follow from these principles. Quantum field theory emerges from this as a natural consequence. The author presents the classic calculations of quantum electrodynamics in a thoroughly modern way, showing the use of path integrals and dimensional regularization. His account of renormalization theory reflects the changes in our view of quantum field theory since the advent of effective field theories. The book's scope extends beyond quantum electrodynamics to elementary particle physics, and nuclear physics. It contains much original material, and is peppered with examples and insights drawn from the author's experience as a leader of elementary particle research. Problems are included at the end of each chapter.

The ideal of the day, however, was inner beauty: a focus on good deeds and a pure heart. Today American women have more social choices and personal freedom than ever before. But fifty-three percent of our girls are dissatisfied with their bodies by the age of thirteen, and many begin a pattern of weight obsession and dieting as early as eight or nine. Why?<br /><br />In <b>The Body Project</b>, historian Joan Jacobs Brumberg answers this question, drawing on diary excerpts and media images from 1830 to the present. Tracing girls' attitudes toward topics ranging from breast size and menstruation to hair, clothing, and cosmetics, she exposes the shift from the Victorian concern with inner beauty to our modern focus on outward appearance--in particular, the desire to be model-thin and sexy. Compassionate, insightful, and gracefully written, <b>The Body Project</b> explores the gains and losses adolescent girls have inherited since they shed the corset and the ideal of virginity for a new world of sexual freedom and consumerism--a world in which the body is their primary project.<br /><br />""Joan Brumberg's book offers us an insightful and entertaining history behind the destructive mantra of the '90s--'I hate my body!'"" --Katie Couric",3.83,214,Paperback, ,196,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150749.The_Body_Project,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150749.The_Body_Project

They were burying a woman: the man’s wife, the children’s mother. The children were all very young, and within a few years the two oldest were dead, too.<br /><br />Close to the wild beauty of the Yorkshire moors, the father brought up his young family. Who had heard of the Brontës of Haworth then? Branwell died while he was still a young man, but the three sisters who were left had an extraordinary gift. They could write marvellous stories – Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall . . . But Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Brontë did not live to grow old or to enjoy their fame. Only their father was left, alone with his memories.<br /><br />The Oxford Bookworms Library offers new editions of the original Oxford Bookworms Black and Green series, merging the two series into one with new covers. The new editions build on the success of the original series and provide enhanced teaching support. Sixteen additional pages inside each book allow extra pages of activities and increased author and series information. Some of the titles have new illustrations.
