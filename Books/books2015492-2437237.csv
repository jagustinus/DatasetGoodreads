Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas is one such literary hero who has come alive in listeners' imaginations as he explores the greatest mysteries of this world and the next with his inimitable wit, heart, and quiet gallantry.<br /><br />Now Koontz follows Odd as he is irresistibly drawn onward, to a destiny he cannot imagine. The legend began in the obscure little town of Pico Mundo. A fry cook named Odd was rumored to have the extraordinary ability to communicate with the dead. Through tragedy and triumph, exhilaration and heartbreak, word of Odd Thomas' gifts filtered far beyond Pico Mundo, attracting unforgettable new friends - and enemies of implacable evil. With great gifts comes the responsibility to meet great challenges. But no mere human being was ever meant to face the darkness that now stalks the world - not even one as oddly special as Odd Thomas.<br /><br />After grappling with the very essence of reality itself, after finding the veil separating him from his soul mate, Stormy Llewellyn, tantalizingly thin yet impenetrable, Odd longed only to return to a life of quiet anonymity with his two otherworldly sidekicks - his dog, Boo, and a new companion, one of the few who might rival his old pal Elvis. But a true hero, however humble, must persevere.<br /><br />Haunted by dreams of an all-encompassing red tide, Odd is pulled inexorably to the sea, to a small California coastal town where nothing is as it seems. Now the forces arrayed against him have both official sanction and an infinitely more sinister authority...and in this dark night of the soul, dawn will come only after the most shattering revelations of all.<br /><br /> ©2008 Dean Koontz; (P)2008 Brilliance Audio",3.94,283,Hardcover, ,2019,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2029927.Odd_Hours,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2029927.Odd_Hours

Boosters of the city have long capitalized on this splendor, recently likening it to the fairytale capital of L. Frank Baum’s <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, the Emerald City. But just as Dorothy, Toto, and their traveling companions discover a darker reality upon entering the green gates of the imaginary Emerald City, those who look more closely at Seattle’s landscape will find that it reveals a history marked by environmental degradation and urban inequality.<br /><br />This book explores the role of nature in the development of the city of Seattle from the earliest days of its settlement to the present. Combining environmental history, urban history, and human geography, Matthew Klingle shows how attempts to reshape nature in and around Seattle have often ended not only in ecological disaster but also social inequality. The price of Seattle’s centuries of growth and progress has been paid by its wildlife, including the famous Pacific salmon, and its poorest residents. Klingle proposes a bold new way of understanding the interdependence between nature and culture, and he argues for what he calls an “ethic of place.” Using Seattle as a compelling case study, he offers important insights for every city seeking to live in harmony with its natural landscape.<br /><br /> ",3.79,368,Hardcover, ,20,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2034753.Emerald_City,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2034753.Emerald_City

For all its simple humor, <i>The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy &amp; Other Stories</i> is a peculiarly disturbing book about the violence that children suffer.

Here for the first time is the definitive history of the submarine war against Japan--the <i>only</i> full-scale submarine war the United States ever fought--which has for the most part been shrouded in secrecy for three decades. Only recently have the codebreakers who played such a pivotal role in the submarine war been willing to talk about their work. And only recently have the private papers, diaries, and official reports of the submarine admirals and skippers been made available to historians.<br /><br />In preparing to write this book, Clay Blair, Jr. combed hundreds of thousands of pages of recently declassified documents and personal letters. In individual interviews he listened to scores of skippers, staff officers, and codebreakers speaking freely. He researched in depth the development of submarine and torpedo from prewar days down to the present time. The result is a revealing and immensely exciting book that sets the submarine war within the framework of history and the overall war in the Pacific.<br /><br /><i>Silent Victory</i> takes you into the submarine war at all levels--the highest strategy sessions in Washington, the terrifying moments in a submarine trapped on the bottom for hours as depth charges explode around it, the zany efforts of a torpedo crew coaxing an emaciated chicken to lay an egg. It tells of the jealous infighting of admirals vying for power . . . of ""overcautious"" skippers, trained in peacetime and ill suited for war, and the mutinies they provoked . . . of the shocking torpedo scandal and the toll it took . . . of the later breed of younger skippers whose daring was so effective against Japanese shipping that the war, as Blair argues, could have ended months earlier, saving thousands of lives.<br /><br />The complete saga that led to victory is here supplemented by ● 37 specially drawn maps showing submarine activity in the context of every important naval engagement in the Pacific ● 32 pages of photographs ● 12 appendixes, including a calendar of all submarine war patrols ● an index of over 2,000 entries. A work of great scholarship and scope, <i>Silent Victory</i> is a timeless contribution to the history of World War II.",4.35,1072,Hardcover, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2046158.Silent_Victory,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2046158.Silent_Victory

In another, a woman at a window weighs pieces of silver. Vermeer's images captivate us with their beauty and mystery: What stories lie behind these stunningly rendered moments? As Timothy Brook shows us, these pictures, which seem so intimate, actually offer a remarkable view of a rapidly expanding world. The officer's dashing hat is made of beaver fur, which European explorers got from Native Americans in exchange for weapons. Those beaver pelts, in turn, financed the voyages of sailors seeking new routes to China.

He has been named Time Out’s Comedian of the Year, Best Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards, and Most Stylish Man by GQ’s Men. His UK stand-up tour was sold out and his BBC Radio 6 show became a cult phenomenon, the second most popular podcast of the year. Before the fame, however, Russell’s life was anything but glamorous. His father left when he was three months old, he was bulimic at age 12, and began drinking heavily and taking drugs by age 16. He regularly visited prostitutes in Soho, began cutting himself, took drugs on stage during his stand-up shows, and even set himself on fire while on crack cocaine. In 2003 Russell was told that he would be in prison, a mental hospital, or dead within six months unless he went into rehab. He has now been clean for three years, and hasn’t looked back since.

Profundamente enraizada en lo popular, la narrativa de Juan Rulfo describe con conmovedora fuerza la cotidiana realidad de un mundo a la vez violento y lírico. Si los cuentos de <i>El llano en llamas</i> describen, con exquisita sobriedad, el mundo de los campesinos de Jalisco, <i>Pedro Páramo</i> lleva el dolor mexicano a su forma más universal, trascendiendo -sin olvidarla- la historia real.

What to do about relatives who are in the way? What is the proper punishment for a bookbinder who takes too long at his job? Are free libraries an unmixed blessing?<br /><br />More seriously: Can nothing make it worth our while not to quarrel with our fellows? Which is more desirable: memory or forgetfulness? Are we irrevocably cut off from the natural world, or might there still be a way back to it?<br /><br />--<br />Kenneth Grahame (1859-1932) was a British writer, mainly of the sort of fiction and fantasy written for children but enjoyed equally if not more by adults. He is most famous for The Wind in the Willows (1908), one of the classics of children's literature. He also wrote The Reluctant Dragon, which was much later adapted into a Disney movie. While still a young man, Grahame began to publish light stories in London periodicals such as the St. James Gazette. Some of these stories were collected and published as Pagan Papers in 1893, and, two years later, The Golden Age. These were followed by Dream Days in 1898, which contains The Reluctant Dragon. There is a ten-year gap between Grahame's penultimate book and the publication of his triumph, The Wind in the Willows. During this decade Grahame became a father. The wayward headstrong nature he saw in his little son he transformed into the swaggering Toad of Toad Hall, one of its four principal characters. Despite its success, he never attempted a sequel.",3.33,48,Paperback, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2075393.Pagan_Papers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2075393.Pagan_Papers

He is the sole survivor of an ill-fated mining expedition in which both his masters, William and Richard Craver, died and from which their African porters fled. Garvey returns to London carrying two diamonds of extraordinary size, spinning a story too unspeakably terrifying to be believed. He is promptly arrested. <br /><br />Tommy Thompson, a London ghostwriter for a ghostwriter for a ghostwriter (don't ask!), is approached by his attorney to document Garvey's unholy African odyssey. From his prison cell awaiting the murder trial, Garvey recounts the mind-boggling horror that the Craver mining expedition encountered in the dark recesses of the Congo. <br /><br />Exactly how did the Craver brothers die? What unearthly forces would drive men to commit such acts of immeasurable brutality? Could love have possibly bloomed in the heart of such darkness? Only Tommy can untangle the mysteries of the Garvey case.

In <i>Sway</i>, renowned organizational thinker Ori Brafman and his brother, psychologist Rom Brafman, answer all these questions and more.<br /><br />Drawing on cutting-edge research from the fields of social psychology, behavioral economics, and organizational behavior, <i>Sway</i> reveals dynamic forces that influence every aspect of our personal and business lives, including loss aversion (our tendency to go to great lengths to avoid perceived losses), the diagnosis bias (our inability to reevaluate our initial diagnosis of a person or situation), and the “chameleon effect” (our tendency to take on characteristics that have been arbitrarily assigned to us). <br /><br /><i>Sway</i> introduces us to the Harvard Business School professor who got his students to pay $204 for a $20 bill, the head of airline safety whose disregard for his years of training led to the transformation of an entire industry, and the football coach who turned conventional strategy on its head to lead his team to victory. We also learn the curse of the NBA draft, discover why interviews are a terrible way to gauge future job performance, and go inside a session with the Supreme Court to see how the world’s most powerful justices avoid the dangers of group dynamics.<br /><br />Every once in a while, a book comes along that not only challenges our views of the world but changes the way we think. In <i>Sway,</i> Ori and Rom Brafman not only uncover rational explanations for a wide variety of irrational behaviors but also point readers toward ways to avoid succumbing to their pull.",3.78,206,Hardcover, ,905,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2118114.Sway,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2118114.Sway

Since the courts in Manhattan are near Chinatown, I like jury duty, as it means a few days of excellent lunches. Instead, New York was hit with a ferocious, sub-zero ice storm that went on for days, where it was impossible to wander in the way I had hoped, and so, with the grind of the trial itself, we jurors were marooned for close to 4 hours each day in the jury room. The second night of the trial, however, I had a strange dream where a friend of mine appeared in the exact garb of one of <i>The Glass Books'</i> three main characters, Doctor Svenson, and together we faced a mystery in a strange, dark, Victorian building involving prisoners in a creepy upstairs room without a door. While I very rarely remember my dreams, the next morning I found this one percolating in my head quite vividly. But then, for no reason I can recall, I took out a notebook, and began — instead of the Doctor, who I would get to almost off-handedly in another 100 pages or so — writing about a willful young woman from the West Indies whose fiancée has abandoned her without explanation, making it up as I went along. By the end of the trial I had the first chapter. I am by trade a playwright, and had not written prose fiction of any kind for nearly 20 years, but I found myself hooked on the story and the characters — perhaps out of my own desire to know what happened next — and so persisted, putting aside most everything else, writing for the most part in coffee shops and on the subway, until I finished the book almost exactly one year later.""<br /><i>--Gordon Dahlquist</i><br /><br />",3.50,753,Trade Paperback, ,120,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2132429.The_Glass_Books_of_the_Dream_Eaters,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2132429.The_Glass_Books_of_the_Dream_Eaters

It is 1946, and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her children on her husband's Mississippi Delta farm - a place she finds foreign and frightening. In the midst of the family's struggles, two young men return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan, Laura's brother-in-law, is everything her husband is not - charming, handsome, and haunted by his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson, eldest son of the black sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm, has come home with the shine of a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country, he is still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South. It is the unlikely friendship of these brothers-in-arms that drives this powerful novel to its inexorable conclusion. <br /><br />The men and women of each family relate their versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players in a tragedy on the grandest scale. As Kingsolver says of Hillary Jordan, ""Her characters walked straight out of 1940s Mississippi and into the part of my brain where sympathy and anger and love reside, leaving my heart racing.

Group,eng,false,"One of the most influential thinkers of our time, Stephen Hawking is an intellectual icon, known not only for the adventurousness of his ideas but for the clarity and wit with which he expresses them. In this new book Hawking takes us to the cutting edge of theoretical physics, where truth is often stranger than fiction, to explain in laymen's terms the principles that control our universe. Like many in the community of theoretical physicists, Professor Hawking is seeking to uncover the grail of science - the elusive Theory of Everything that lies at the heart of the cosmos. In his accessible and often playful style, he guides us on his search to uncover the secrets of the universe - from supergravity to supersymmetry, from quantum theory to M-theory, from holography to duality. He takes us to the wild frontiers of science, where superstring theory and p-branes may hold the final clue to the puzzle. And he lets us behind the scenes of one of his most exciting intellectual adventures as he seeks ""to combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe."" With characteristic exuberance, Professor Hawking invites us to be fellow travelers on this extraordinary voyage through space-time. Copious four-color illustrations help clarify this journey into a surreal wonderland where particles, sheets, and strings move in eleven dimensions; where black holes evaporate and disappear, taking their secret with them; and where the original cosmic seed from which our own universe sprang was a tiny nut. The Universe in a Nutshell is essential reading for all of us who want to understand the universe in which we live.

This mythic quality is entirely appropriate for the man known as ""The Interpreter of Mysteries"" and ""The Tongue of the Hidden,"" whose verse is regarded as oracular by those seeking guidance and attempting to realize wishes.<br />A mere fraction of what is presumed to have been an extensive body of work survives. This collection is derived from Hafiz's Divan (collected poems), a classic of Sufism. The short poems, called ghazals, are sonnet-like arrangements of varied numbers of couplets. In the tradition of Persian poetry and Sufi philosophy, each poem corresponds to two interpretations, sensual and mystic.<br />This outstanding translation of Hafiz's poetry was created by historian and Arabic scholar Gertrude Bell, who observed, ""These are the utterances of a great poet, the imaginative interpreter of the heart of man; they are not of one age, or of another, but for all time.""",4.63,362,Hardcover, ,19,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2142496._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2142496._

He buried it and told me I must never tell. It was the only thing we’d ever done together as father and son, and I promised not to tell. But unlike most dreams, the memory of this one never left me. And sometimes…I wasn’t altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?”<i></i><br /><br />When Augusten Burroughs was small, his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs, a cough from the basement, a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older, something sinister within his father began to unfurl.  Something dark and secretive that could not be named. <br /><br />Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued, and Augusten’s childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didn’t exist for him. This father was distant, aloof, uninterested…<br /><br />And then the “games” began.<br /><br />With ""A Wolf at the Table"", Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate, the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight, it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal, ""A Wolf at the Table"" will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive.

It’s more of that “Ah ha?so that’s how they do it,” straight-to-the-point, skip the techno jargon; packed with stuff you can really use today, that made Vol. 1 the world’s bestselling book on digital photography.In Volume 2, Scott adds entirely new chapters packed with Plain English tips on using flash, shooting close up photography, travel photography, shooting people, and even how to build a studio from scratch, where he demystifies the process so anyone can start taking pro-quality portraits today! Plus, he's got full chapters on his most requested topics, including loads of tips for landscape photographers, wedding photographers, and there's an entire chapter devoted to sharing some of the pro's secrets for making your photos look more professional, no matter what you're shooting. This book truly has a brilliant premise, and here’s how Scott describes it: “If you and I were out on a shoot, and you asked me, 'When I use my flash, the background behind the person I’m shooting turns black. How do I fix that?’ I wouldn’t give you a lecture on flash ratios, or start a discussion on flash synchronization and rear curtain sync. I’d just say “Lower your shutter speed to 1/60 of a second. That should do it” Well, that’s what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets I’ve learned just like I would with a friend?without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.”Each page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, you’ll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints.

Pero esta vez no lo hace para contarnos sus andanzas, sino para narrar la vida del misionero jesuita Pedro Paez, nacido en un pueblo de Madrid en el siglo XVI y primer europeo que alcanzó a ver las fuentes del Nilo azul en Etiopía. Pedro Paez, gran desconocido para el público español e incluso para muchos historiadores, fue un hombre de cualidades excepcionales: Políglota, hombre de acción, intelectual y arquitecto, convirtió a dos emperadores etíopes a la fe de Roma, recorrió antes que ningun otro europeo los territorios del sur del Yemen, levantó un palacio en piedra de dos plantas en la orillas del lago Tana y dejó escrito en portugués un imponente libro –no traducido al castellano- de carácter científico referido a Etiopía. Desde la amenidad, el rigor y la pasión, Javier Reverte nos dibuja el perfil de Paez enmarcado en su tiempo: la España de los Austrias en pleno periodo de hegemonía política. También nos habla de los azarosos viajes de los navegantes portugueses por el oceáno Índico, de la fundación y las misiones de la compañía de Jesús y del África ignorada y remota de los siglos XVI y XVII.

Disco is over, but punk never happened. They don't have cable. They don't really have pop culture, unless you count grain prices and alcoholism. People work hard and then they die. They hate the government and impregnate teenage girls. But that's not nearly as awful as it sounds; in fact, sometimes it's perfect.<br /><br />Mitch Hrlicka lives in Owl. He plays high school football and worries about his weirdness, or lack thereof. Julia Rabia just moved to Owl. She gets free booze and falls in love with a self-loathing bison farmer who listens to Goats Head Soup. Horace Jones has resided in Owl for seventy-three years. He consumes a lot of coffee, thinks about his dead wife, and understands the truth. They all know each other completely, except that they've never met.<br /><br />Like a colder, Reagan-era version of The Last Picture Show fused with Friday Night Lights, Chuck Klosterman's Downtown Owl is the unpretentious, darkly comedic story of how it feels to exist in a community where rural mythology and violent reality are pretty much the same thing. Loaded with detail and unified by a (very real) blizzard, it's technically about certain people in a certain place at a certain time...but it's really about a problem.

Books I-IV are concerned with infancy and learning to talk, schooldays, sexual desire and adolescent rebellion, intense friendships and intellectual exploration. Augustine evolves and analyses his past with all the resources of the reading which shaped his mind: Virgil and Cicero, Neoplatonism and the Bible. This volume, which aims to be usable by students who are new to Augustine, alerts readers to the verbal echoes and allusions of Augustine's brilliant and varied Latin, and explains his theological and philosophical questioning of what God is and what it is to be human.

Now Liss delivers his best novel yet in an entirely new setting–America in the years after the Revolution, an unstable nation where desperate schemers vie for wealth, power, and a chance to shape a country’s destiny.<br /><br />Ethan Saunders, once among General Washington’s most valued spies, now lives in disgrace, haunting the taverns of Philadelphia. An accusation of treason has long since cost him his reputation and his beloved fiancée, Cynthia Pearson, but at his most desperate moment he is recruited for an unlikely task–finding Cynthia’s missing husband. To help her, Saunders must serve his old enemy, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who is engaged in a bitter power struggle with political rival Thomas Jefferson over the fragile young nation’s first real financial institution: the Bank of the United States.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Joan Maycott is a young woman married to another Revolutionary War veteran. With the new states unable to support their ex-soldiers, the Maycotts make a desperate gamble: trade the chance of future payment for the hope of a better life on the western Pennsylvania frontier. There, amid hardship and deprivation, they find unlikely friendship and a chance for prosperity with a new method of distilling whiskey. But on an isolated frontier, whiskey is more than a drink; it is currency and power, and the Maycotts’ success attracts the brutal attention of men in Hamilton’s orbit, men who threaten to destroy all Joan holds dear.<br /><br />As their causes intertwine, Joan and Saunders–both patriots in their own way–find themselves on opposing sides of a daring scheme that will forever change their lives and their new country. <i>The Whiskey Rebels</i> is a superb rendering of a perilous age and a nation nearly torn apart–and David Liss’s most powerful novel yet.",3.89,519,Hardcover, ,803,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2182488.The_Whiskey_Rebels,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2182488.The_Whiskey_Rebels

A year later, he'd completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, not to mention triathlons and a dozen critically acclaimed books, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and--even more important--on his writing. Equal parts training log, travelogue, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and takes us to places ranging from Tokyo's Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston among young women who outpace him. Through this marvelous lens of sport emerges a panorama of memories and insights: the eureka moment when he decided to become a writer, his greatest triumphs and disappointments, his passion for vintage LPs, and the experience, after fifty, of seeing his race times improve and then fall back. By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is rich and revelatory, both for fans of this masterful yet guardedly private writer and for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.""",3.85,188,Hardcover, ,6719,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running

Lawrence’s Brough Superior SS100; Von Dutch’s Condor, Craig Vetter’s Mystery Ship, and Mike Hailwood’s Honda RC162. These are just some of the machines that have made motorcycle history, and that make this book a feast for the eyes and a fact-filled odyssey for the motorcycle aficionado.<br /><br />Illustrated with commissioned photographs and historical images, the book profiles the bikes--not just the models but the actual motorcycles--that have achieved legendary status in the last century. Their stories, told here in detail for the first time, make up the story of the motorcycle in American culture.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />See Motorbooks author Basem Wasef interviewed by Jay Leno on JayLenosGarage.com: <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""http://www.jaylenosgarage.com/video/jays-book-club-basem-wasef/1168295/"">http://www.jaylenosgarage.com/video/j...</a>",4.60,176,Hardcover, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2201185.Legendary_Motorcycles,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2201185.Legendary_Motorcycles

Running through David's head the whole time are the lyrics of a Replacements song, "". . . Look me in the eye, then tell me that I'm satisfied,"" and it gives all the more purpose to their quest.

Yet, how does a passport actually work, and what happens when it doesn't? When was the first passport issued? How can a forged passport be detected, and how did a passport link Lord Palmerston to the attempted assassination of Napoleon III? In this book, Martin Lloyd uses his in-depth experience with H.M. Immigration Service to explore the problems, humour, crime and politics which constitute the history of the passport. The idea of the passport is not new. The Ancient Egyptians were known to have a passport system while, in Roman times, persons travelling on official business were issued with a Tractorium (a letter) in the name of the emperor. Yet contrary to the popular idea, passports were often used to prevent not facilitate travel. William the Conqueror allowed no one to enter or leave England without his permission while Henry I and Elizabeth I refused to grant passports to, respectively, the legate from the Pope and Mary, Queen of Scots. Passports have also enabled murder to take place and saved the lives of many Jews in the Second World War. However, their ultimate role appears to be that of control. When machine-readable passports provide the state with more information on the movement of citizens than at any time in history, many are beginning to ask whether the age of Big Brother has not already arrived.<br /><br />The Passport offers a unique perspective on the intriguing history of this document. Martin Lloyd draws on many years of research, and includes illustrations from his own collection, to create the first book on this subject.",3.32,288,Paperback, ,7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2211697.The_Passport,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2211697.The_Passport

Until now, however, it is a story that has never been fully told, as the Bin Ladens have successfully fended off attempts to understand the family circles from which Osama sprang. In this the family has been abetted by the kingdom it calls home, Saudi Arabia, one of the most closed societies on earth.Steve Coll’s <i>The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century</i> is the groundbreaking history of a family and its fortune. It chronicles a young illiterate Yemeni bricklayer, Mohamed Bin Laden, who went to the new, oil-rich country of Saudi Arabia and quickly became a vital figure in its development, building great mosques and highways and making himself and many of his children millionaires. It is also a story of the Saudi royal family, whom the Bin Ladens served loyally and without whose capricious favor they would have been nothing. And it is a story of tensions and contradictions in a country founded on extreme religious purity, which then became awash in oil money and dazzled by the temptations of the West. In only two generations the Bin Ladens moved from a famine-stricken desert canyon to luxury jets, yachts, and private compounds around the world, even going into business with Hollywood celebrities. These religious and cultural gyrations resulted in everything from enthusiasm for America—exemplified by Osama’s free-living pilot brother Salem—to an overwhelming determination to destroy it.<br /><br /><i>The Bin Ladens</i> is a meticulously researched, colorful, shocking, entertaining, and disturbing narrative of global integration and its limitations. It encapsulates the unsettling contradictions of globalization in the story of a single family who has used money, mobility, and technology to dramatically varied ends.",3.97,688,Hardcover, ,169,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2211931.The_Bin_Ladens,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2211931.The_Bin_Ladens

Willie soon realizes that his colonial background allows him to write short stories for well-meaning white liberals, and he begins ""to understand that he was free to present himself as he wished"" and that he could ""remake himself and his past"" through his writing. The effect is suffocating rather than liberating, and he marries a vaguely sketched ""girl or young woman from an African country,"" who has read his one published book. Willie begins another ""half life"" in colonial Mozambique, where he soon tires of the domestic and sexual tedium of plantation life and flees to Germany, mournfully reflecting that ""I have been hiding for too long.""</p><p> This is classic Naipaul, with its effortless dissection of the damaging personal consequences of post-war decolonization, but its virtue seems its primary vice, as the novel feels like a conflation of several earlier Naipaul books, including <i>The Mimic Men</i> and the brilliant <i>A Bend in the River</i>. Consequently, some readers may well find that <i>Half a Life</i> reads more like half a novel. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>",3.25,224,Hardcover,1st,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2220958.Half_a_Life,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2220958.Half_a_Life

In creating them, I lived with my characters so closely that their lives were still as much a part of me as I was of them long after the issues in which they appeared went out of print. Proud as I was of how I presented the characters and their adventures in the pages of the magazines, I wanted to tell the reader more about my people and why they did what they did. So, over the years, I revised and expanded these magazine works into novels that I published as full-length paperbacks under different titles. These particular early magazine versions of my books have long been a source of considerable speculation and curiosity among many of my readers, so much so of late, that now I've decided to bring four of my 'magazine novels' back into print in this latest volume of my short fiction.

He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.",3.90,254,Paperback, ,20,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2239501._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2239501._

Biographers often neglect the captive years of Mary, Queen of Scots, who trusted Queen Elizabeth's promise of sanctuary when she fled from rebels in Scotland and then found herself imprisoned as the ""guest"" of George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and his indomitable wife, Bess of Hardwick. </p><p> The newly married couple welcome the doomed queen into their home, certain that serving as her hosts and jailers will bring them an advantage in the cutthroat world of the Elizabethan court. To their horror, they find that the task will bankrupt them, and as their home becomes the epicenter of intrigue and rebellion against Elizabeth, their loyalty to each other and to their sovereign comes into question. If Mary succeeds in seducing the earl into her own web of treachery and treason, or if the great spymaster William Cecil links them to the growing conspiracy to free Mary from her illegal imprisonment, they will all face the headsman. </p><p> Philippa Gregory uses new research and her passion for historical accuracy to place a well-known heroine in a completely new tale full of suspense, passion, and political intrigue.

Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. <br /><br />Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous ""White City"" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. <br /><br />The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. <br /><br />Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works.

But in this astonishing new book, A. J. Rossmiller, a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst honored for his efforts here and in Iraq, reveals firsthand evidence that the intelligence system remains in disrepair. Still Broken is a blistering account of the ideology and incompetence that cripple our efforts to confront our enemies and fight our wars. Like many Americans, Rossmiller was moved to action by the attacks on 9/11. Freshly graduated from Middlebury College, he went to work for the U.S. government in 2004. But his enthusiasm slowly turned to disillusion as he began to fulfill his duties for DIA, the spy arm of the Department of Defense. There he found the Cold War and 9/11 generations at odds, the cause of fighting terrorism superseded by the need to contain a dismally managed war in Iraq, the Bush administration widely mocked and distrusted, and the intelligence process crippled from top to bottom. Rather than give up, Rossmiller instead went further, volunteering to go to Iraq to aid the troops on the ground, contribute to tactical intelligence, and, he hoped, help bring about an end to a fatally mismanaged war. For six months in that besieged country, he worked for the Direct Action Cell, the track 'em and whack 'em unit devoted to unmasking and targeting insurgents. He learned that, to put it mildly, the intelligence process bears no resemblance to the streamlined, well-resourced, and timely operation in a James Bond or Jason Bourne movie. He also experienced the disastrous counterterrorismand detainee strategies for which mass imprisonment-with little interest in guilt or innocence-is standard operating procedure. Back at the Pentagon as a strategic issues expert in the Office of Iraq Analysis, Rossmiller saw the administration's heavy hand in determining how information is processed. In a dysfunctional office filled with outsize personalities and the constant drone of Fox News, he filed reports on the ever-worsening situation in Iraq. These assessments, ultimately proven accurate, were consistently rejected as too pessimistic and off message and repeatedly changed to be more in line with delusional White House projections. Written with passion, intensity, and self-deprecating humor, Still Broken is a riveting and sobering portrait of Bush-era intelligence failures and manipulations, laid out by someone who witnessed them up close and personal. It also offers a sincere, thoughtful prescription for healing the system so that a new and motivated generation won't disengage completely from its government.",3.67,256,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2249496.Still_Broken,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2249496.Still_Broken

    <p>At first Burz isn't such a bad place, though the paper mill reeks to high heaven. But the longer he stays there, the stranger it becomes. No one will tell him where to find his relatives. Even stranger, when he mentions the name Merss, people think he's threatening them. The witches' coven that every Fenarian town and city should have is nowhere in evidence. And the Guild, which should be protecting the city's craftsmen and traders, is an oppressive, all-powerful organization, into which no tradesman would ever be admitted.</p>
    <p>Then a terrible thing happens. In its wake, far from Draegara, without his usual organization working for him, Vlad is going to have to do his sleuthing amidst an alien people: his own.</p>

She participated in many international congresses, among them the historic discussion of lay analysis, chaired by Sigmund Freud.<br /><br /><br />Dr. Horney came to the United States in 1932 and for two years was Associate Director of the Psychoanalytic Institute, Chicago.

She unfolds the different stages of this situation, describing neurotic claims, the tyranny or inner dictates and the neurotic's solutions for relieving the tensions of conflict in such emotional attitudes as domination, self-effacement, dependency, or resignation. Throughout, she outlines with penetrating insight the forces that work for and against the person's realization of his or her potentialities.<br /><br /><br />This 40th Anniversary Edition includes a new preface by Stephanie Steinfeld, Ph.D., and Jeffrey Rubin, M.D., of the American Institute for Psychoanalysis.",4.30, ,Paperback, ,21,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2261424._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2261424._

The grandmother is unsentimental and wise, if a little cranky; Sophia is impetuous and volatile, but she tends to her grandmother with the care of a new parent. Together they amble over coastline and forest in easy companionship, build boats from bark, create a miniature Venice, write a fanciful study of local bugs.

There is no figure aside from Jesus himself who is more important to the history of this world religion, and no figure from the age of the early church about whom we know more or of whom we have a more rounded view. Historian Luke Timothy Johnson, the best-selling author of The Real Jesus, offers a fresh and historically grounded assessment of the life and letters of Christianity's ""apostle to the Gentiles"" in this 12-lecture series. ""One of the most fascinating, important, and controversial figures in the religious history of the West, Paul the Apostle continues to find champions and detractors, sometimes in surprising places,"" says Professor Johnson. This course addresses many questions concerning Paul's embattled life and work: Is Paul the inventor of Christianity or part of a larger movement? Is he best understood from the Acts of the Apostles or from his letters? Why does he focus on moral character of the community? How do his supporters and detractors depict him? You consider his letters to the Thessalonians, Corinthians, and Galatians. You explore his religious commitments as a member of the Pharisaic movement, his persecution of the Christian sect, the dramatic experience that changed him into an apostle, and his work as a missionary and church founder. The Controversial Apostle Controversy has always swirled around Paul. In fact, it began during his lifetime. As a Pharisaic persecutor of Christianity who became one of its most vocal and active exponents, as a Jew who preached to Gentiles, and as a missionary and pastor who had to deal with a wide range of demanding situations across several decades and many miles, it is hardly surprising that Paul should attract a body of critics and defenders who are as numerous and intense as his stature is titanic. The 13 letters associated with Paul, together with the large sections of the Acts of the Apostles that recount his missionary journeys, form the bulk of the New Testament. His writings-nearly all of which were set down and circulated before the Gospels were written-have been endlessly scoured as sources for Christian doctrine and morals. A Passionate Poet of the Divine Paul is an eloquent and passionate poet of the divine. His works are full of unforgettable passages, and his words have exercised an important influence on countless ""ordinary"" believers as well as theological giants such as Augustine and Luther. Paul's personality has been endlessly analyzed. He is one of the great converters (or turncoats, depending on one's perspective) in history. Modern thinkers inclined to fault Christianity-Nietzsche, Freud, and George Bernard Shaw, to name three of the more famous-often save their most intense scrutiny for Paul, whose views on issues of morality, sex, and authority continue to be contentious. The Heart and Mind of a Pastor Yet amid all the controversy around Paul, we tend to ignore the things which most concerned him, namely, the stability and integrity of the tiny Christian communities to which he wrote his letters. Professor Johnson aims to rectify this by focusing precisely on these letters to learn something about Paul in the context of early Christianity. After all, before Paul became a source for theology and a part of the canon of Scripture, he was a missionary and pastor. This leads to thought-provoking questions such as: What were the problems with which Paul and his readers had to deal? How did his letters sometimes create as many problems as they solved? What clues to reading Paul can we get from recent research on ancient rhetoric? In what sense is Paul a ""radical,"" and in what sense does he mean his letters to have ""conservative"" implications? What relation do Paul's preaching and writings about the risen Christ have to the Jesus whose words and deeds we read of in the Gospels? As you join Professor Johnson in reading Paul's letters as individual literary compositions devoted to solving the urgent pastoral problems of the Christian communities he was nurturing, you begin to hear Paul's voice speaking to real-life situations and genuine crises. A Portrait Drawn from Life Such reading yields a picture of Paul that is far more complex than any stereotype, whether positive or negative. It is a portrait drawn from life. You find a Paul who struggles to establish the authority to teach even in a community that he has founded (1 Corinthians), then finds its allegiance slipping away just as he is engaged in the greatest act of his career (2 Corinthians). You discover a Paul who writes to relieve a community's mind (1 Thessalonians) only to find that he has inflamed its imagination (2 Thessalonians). You appreciate a Paul who seeks to realize an egalitarian ideal, and succeeds on some fronts (Galatians), but has only ambiguous results (Philemon) and undoubtedly fails (1 Timothy) on others. You see a Paul who sets out to raise money for a future trip and ends up creating a theological masterwork (Romans). And you see a Paul who finds himself imprisoned, ""an apostle in chains,"" yet who uses his very confinement to expand his witness and set forth his vision of Christ's church as a sacrament of the world's best possibilities (Colossians, Ephesians). Perhaps most provocatively, Professor Johnson parts company with much modern scholarship by arguing that Paul, though he may not have literally written any of his letters, should nonetheless be considered the true author of all. ""The only requirement for this course is the willingness to journey along with Paul as he thinks his way through the problems he faces,"" says Professor Johnson. ""The payoff is learning why Paul has had such an enormous influence, and why he remains a vital force in the religious life of millions, a living voice whose summoning words sustain Christian communities to this day and subvert all tendencies to reduce Christianity to a form of religious routine<br /><br />Great Courses #657",4.01, ,Audio CD,Great Courses,18,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2281229.The_Apostle_Paul,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2281229.The_Apostle_Paul

The story pulses with life as three Iranian sisters struggle to make sense of matters of the heart and the spirit.” <br />–Elizabeth Cox, author of The Slow Moon<br /><br />More than a year has passed since Marjan, Bahar, and Layla, the beautiful Iranian Aminpour sisters, sought refuge in the quaint Irish town of Ballinacroagh. Opening the beguiling Babylon Café, they charmed the locals with their warm hearts and delectable Persian cuisine, bringing a saffron-scented spice to the once-sleepy village. <br /><br />But when a young woman with a dark secret literally washes up on Clew Bay Beach, the sisters’ world is once again turned upside down. With pale skin and webbed hands, the girl is otherworldly, but her wounds tell a more earthly (and graver) story–one that sends the strict Catholic town into an uproar. The Aminpours rally around the newcomer, but each sister must also contend with her own transformation–Marjan tests her feelings for love with a dashing writer, Bahar takes on a new spiritual commitment with the help of Father Mahoney, and Layla matures into a young woman when she and her boyfriend, Malachy, step up their hot and heavy relationship. <br /><br />Filled with mouthwatering recipes and enchanting details of life in Ireland, Rosewater and Soda Bread is infused with a lyrical warmth that radiates from the Aminpour family and their big-hearted Italian landlady, Estelle, to the whole of Ballinacroagh–and the world beyond.<br /><br /><br /><b>Praise for Marsha Mehran’s Pomegranate Soup</b><br /><br />“A mouthwatering tale with flavors of Chocolat and Under the Tuscan Sun . . . sinfully sweet and satisfying.”<br />–Orlando Sentinel<br /><br />“Glorious, daring, and delightful, filled with humor, hope, and possibility.” <br />–Adriana Trigiani, author of the Big Stone Gap novels<br /><br />“An enchanting tale of love, family, and renewal.”<br />–Firoozeh Dumas, author of Laughing Without an Accent<i>

Dieser Roman ist dem sogenannten ""Steampunk"" zuzurechnen: Elektronik, Magie, Zeitreise, d.h. alle möglichen SF-Themen finden im 19. Jahrhundert statt in der Zukunft oder Gegenwart ihre Anwendung. Und im 19. Jahrhundert dient den Autoren, darunter auch Tim Powers und James Blaylock und K.W. Jeter, das London von Charles Dickens als Schauplatz der Handlung.<p> London im Smog, Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts, in einer Parallelwelt. Das Computerzeitalter ist angebrochen, seit es dem berühmten Erfinder Charles Babbage 1821 gelungen ist, seine auf dem Lochkartensystem basierende ""Differenz-Maschine"" zu vervollkommnen. Dampfbetriebene Computer treiben die Industrielle Revolution voran, Großbritannien und Frankreich haben Europa untereinander aufgeteilt, ebenso den kolonisierbaren Rest der Welt. Eine goldenes Zeitalter?</p><p> Leider nein, denn die menschliche Natur ist die gleiche geblieben: Neid, Haß und Verrat gedeihen wie eh und je und verstricken die unterschiedlichsten Menschen in folgenreiche Ereignisse von Gewalt und Brutalität. An der Spitze der sozialen Pyramide: Der skrupellose Wüstling Lord Byron als Premierminister einer technoktratischen Regierung. Da wäre zum Beispiel Sybil Gerard, die Tochter eines berüchtigten Ludditen, d.h. Maschinenstürmers -- eine ""gefallene Frau"" und Edelprostituierte; und da wäre Edward Mallory, Entdecker, Paläontologe und Rekonstrukteur des Land-Leviathan; und da wäre Lady Ada Byron, die Tochter des Premierministers, ein mathematisches Genie und zwanghafte Glücksspielerin; und schließlich Laurence Oliphant, seines Zeichens Leiter der Geheimdienstabteilung des Außenministeriums, ein Diplomat und Drahtzieher.</p><p> Diese vier und viele weitere sind wider Willen gefangen im Netz einer Verschwörung, das Großbritannien mit dem Frankreich Louis Napoleons und Karl Marx' Kommune von Manhattan miteinander verbindet. Und es kommt noch dicker: Der Computer des Titels scheint auf dem besten Weg, ein Bewußtsein zu erlangen und die Weltherrschaft anzustreben...</p><p> Grobritannien wird dargestellt als ein negatives Utopia, dessen sichtbare Verelendung und Verschmutzung die apokalyptischen Visionen, Charles Dickens (z.B. aus ""Hard Times"") von einem industrialisierten Land hatte, widerzuspiegeln scheint. Dieses Land wird beherrscht von Berechnung, Berechenbarkeit, Bemessung und streng ""praktischen"" Erwägungen. Große Autobahnen für stinkende Automobile durchziehen das erstickende London; gigantische Hochäuser beherbergen die bürokratische Elite der Technokraten, die die MASCHINEN bedienen, das heißt die großen, dampfbetriebenen Lochkartencomputer. Hier wird der Maschinengott elektronisch erleuchtet, seine erwachendes Bewußtsein ist eine Bedrohung der gesamten Welt. Dies verlangt geradezu nach einer Maschinenstürmerin wie Sybil Gerard. In der Jagd auf sie inszenieren die beiden Autoren ein wildes Autorennen quer durch die versmogte Innenstadt von London, mit einem fulminanten Showdown in den elenden Hafendocks, wo das Verbrechen blüht.</p><p> Gibson hatte sich vorher schon einen Ruf als Moralist der SF erworben, hier bestätigt er ihn. Zusammen mit Sterling vernichtet er den Mythos von einer heilsbringenden Herrschaft der Computer, ja die Vorstellung von einer Future History der Menschheit überhaupt. Daher sollte dieses Werk keinesfalls unterschätzt werden. Für den Leser erweist es sich jedoch als großer Vorteil, wenn er schon viel über das viktorianische London und über die Arbeitsweise von Computern weiß. Dies verhilft zu etlichen ironischen Einsichten, die die Handlung und einige der Charaktere anbieten. Karl Marx nach Mahattan zu verfrachten und seine Kommune dort, in der Hochburg des Kapitalismus, einrichten zu lassen, ist schon ein starkes Stück.<i>--Michael Matzer</i></p>",3.45,572,Paperback,German Edition,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2292561.Die_Differenzmaschine,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2292561.Die_Differenzmaschine

    <b>The bestselling, landmark work of undercover reportage, now updated</b>
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>Acclaimed as an instant classic upon publication, <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> has sold more than 1.5 million copies and become a staple of classroom reading. Chosen for “one book” initiatives across the country, it has fueled nationwide campaigns for a living wage. Funny, poignant, and passionate, this revelatory firsthand account of life in low-wage America—the story of Barbara Ehrenreich’s attempts to eke out a living while working as a waitress, hotel maid, house cleaner, nursing-home aide, and Wal-Mart associate—has become an essential part of the nation’s political discourse.</p>
    <p>Now, in a new afterword, Ehrenreich shows that the plight of the underpaid has in no way eased: with fewer jobs available, deteriorating work conditions, and no pay increase in sight, <i>Nickel and Dimed</i> is more relevant than ever.</p>

  <div>With <i>Exiles</i>, Ron Hansen tells the story of a notorious shipwreck that prompted Gerard Manley Hopkins to break years of self-elected silence with an outpouring of dazzling poetry. <p></p>In December 1875 the steamship <i>Deutschland </i>left Bremen, bound for England and then America. On board were five young nuns who, exiled by Bismarck's laws against Catholic religious orders, were going to begin their lives anew in Missouri. Early one morning, the ship ran aground in the Thames and more than sixty lives were lost, including those of the five nuns. <p></p>Hopkins was a Jesuit seminarian in Wales, and he was so moved by the news of the shipwreck that he wrote a grand poem about it, his first serious work since abandoning a literary career at Oxford to become a priest. He too would die young, an exile from the literary world. But as Hansen's gorgeously written account of Hopkins's life makes clear, he fulfilled his calling. <p></p>Combining a thrilling tragedy at sea with the seeming shipwreck of Hopkins's own life, <i>Exiles </i>joins Hansen's <i>Mariette in Ecstasy </i>(called an astonishingly deft and provocative novel by <i>The New York Times</i>) as a novel that dramatizes the passionate inner search of religious life and makes it accessible to us in the way that only great art can.</div>

The ruthless Grand Duke Orso is locked in a vicious struggle with the squabbling League of Eight, and between them they have bled the land white. While armies march, heads roll and cities burn, behind the scenes bankers, priests and older, darker powers play a deadly game to choose who will be king.<br /><br />War may be hell but for Monza Murcatto, the Snake of Talins, the most feared and famous mercenary in Duke Orso's employ, it's a damn good way of making money too.

It exhibits the essence of Zumthor's ideas in a similar vein as our highly successful Rem Koolhaas: Conversations with Students (see page 11).""The creative act in which a work of architecture comes into being is beyond all historical and technical knowledge. Its focus is on the dialogue with the issues of the time. At the moment of its creation, architecture is bound to the present in a very special way. It reflects the spirit of its inventor and gives its own answers to the questions of the time through its user-oriented form and appearance, its relationship with other works of architecture, and its association with the place where it stands.<br /><br />Answers to the questions which I formulate as an architect are limited. Our times of change and breakthrough do not permit big gestures. We all share the few remaining common values upon which we can build. I thus appeal for a kind of architecture of common sense based on fundamentals that we can all know, understand, and feel. I carefully observe the built-up world, and in my work I try to include valuable aspects that seem to be missing, to correct what is disturbing, and to create anew what is lacking"". -- from Peter Zumthor: Thinking Architecture",4.26,64,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2316831.Thinking_Architecture,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2316831.Thinking_Architecture

Parents and children—and their children's children—have grown up reading his stories. Libraries, parks, and schools have been named in his honor; in 2008, on what would have been his one hundredth birthday, there were celebrations throughout the state. <br /> Many of Leo Politi's books have been out of print for years, and so Getty Publications is proud to reprint four of his most popular titles, including the Caldecott Medal-winning Song of the Swallows, first published in 1948.<br /> Song of the Swallows is the story of a little boy who's waiting for the once-a-year arrival of the swallows in San Juan Capistrano. Pedro: The Angel of Olvera Street, winner of a Caldecott Honor, is a Christmas story that takes place at that famous Los Angeles address, which is also the setting for Juanita, a fable about the annual blessing of the animals at Easter. The four-footed hero of Emmet is a plucky dog who saves his Los Angeles neighborhood from a fire. <br /> These four titles present the best of Leo Politi: the gentle humor and sense of magic that have made his books beloved by generations of readers in California and around the world.<br /></p>",3.55,32, , ,17,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2318035.Juanita,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2318035.Juanita

But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe.

As historical artifacts, they offer a unique perspective on the cultures that produced them. In <i>Manly Meals and Mom's Home Cooking</i>, Jessamyn Neuhaus offers a perceptive and piquant analysis of the tone and content of American cookbooks published between the 1790s and the 1960s, adroitly uncovering the cultural assumptions and anxieties—particularly about women and domesticity—they contain.<br /><br />Neuhaus's in-depth survey of these cookbooks questions the supposedly straightforward lessons about food preparation they imparted. While she finds that cookbooks aimed to make readers—mainly white, middle-class women—into effective, modern-age homemakers who saw joy, not drudgery, in their domestic tasks, she notes that the phenomenal popularity of Peg Bracken's 1960 cookbook, <i>The I Hate to Cook Book</i>, attests to the limitations of this kind of indoctrination. At the same time, she explores the proliferation of bachelor cookbooks aimed at ""the man in the kitchen"" and the biases they display about male and female abilities, tastes, and responsibilities.<br /><br />Neuhaus also addresses the impact of World War II rationing on homefront cuisine; the introduction of new culinary technologies, gourmet sensibilities, and ethnic foods into American kitchens; and developments in the cookbook industry since the 1960s. More than a history of the cookbook, <i>Manly Meals and Mom's Home Cooking</i> provides an absorbing and enlightening account of gender and food in modern America.",3.91,352,Hardcover, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2346585.Manly_Meals_and_Mom_s_Home_Cooking,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2346585.Manly_Meals_and_Mom_s_Home_Cooking

But at the same time he points out that hip-hop is, at its core, simply music, and takes issue with those who celebrate hip-hop as the beginning of a new civil rights program and inflate the lyrics with a kind of radical chic. In a power vacuum, this often offensive and destructive music has become a leading voice of black America, and McWhorter stridently calls for a renewed sense of purpose and pride in black communities.<br /><br /> Joining the ranks of Russell Simmons and others who have called for a deeper investigation of hip-hop’s role in black culture, McWhorter’s <i>All About the Beat</i> is a spectacular polemic that takes the debate in a seismically new direction.",3.27,192,Hardcover, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2363716.All_about_the_Beat,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2363716.All_about_the_Beat

After finally giving birth to a son, Haruko suffers a nervous breakdown and loses her voice. However, determined not to be crushed by the imperial bureaucrats, she perseveres. Thirty years later, now Empress herself, she plays a crucial role in persuading another young woman's rising star in the foreign ministry to accept the marriage proposal of her son, the Crown Prince. The consequences are tragic and dramatic.<br /><br />Told in the voice of Haruko, meticulously researched and superbly imagined, <i>The Commoner</i> is the mesmerizing, moving, and surprising story of a brutally rarified and controlled existence at once hidden and exposed, and of a complex relationship between two isolated women who, despite being visible to all, are truly understood only by each other. With the unerring skill of a master storyteller, John Burnham Schwartz has written his finest novel yet.",3.50,353,Hardcover, ,661,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2364971.The_Commoner,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2364971.The_Commoner

Covering the essentials in clear nontechnical language, Hoffman explains the how and why of arranging publications, the principles of cataloging (including description, main and added entries, analytics, the shelf list, cross references, and filing), and online records. Nearly 100 examples illustrate the cataloging practice. Why do you need a shelf list? What is an authority file? Easy to understand and practical, this gem illuminates the world of monographs, series, irregular serials, uniform titles, simple and complex subject headings, tracings, and location codes. Even the world of the small library is startlingly complex-Hoffman's guide will simplify it. Reviews of previous editions: ""Hoffman's guide to simplified cataloging practice will be a great help...this handbook lays out the options of collection organization clearly and in everyday language."" -Booklist ""Because of its emphasis on fundamentals, rigorous reasoning, and its readable style, the book is also helpful for library school students as well as for practicing librarians."" -Reference &amp; Research Book News ""...will provide its intended reader, the nonprofessional or volunteer in charge of a small library, with solid, well-organized information necessary to catalog a collection systematically.""

But what happens to human feeling in a completely commodified world? In The Post-Office Girl, Stefan Zweig, a deep analyst of the human passions, lays bare the private life of capitalism.<br /><br />Christine toils in a provincial post office in post–World War I Austria, a country gripped by unemployment. Out of the blue, a telegram arrives from Christine’s rich American aunt inviting her to a resort in the Swiss Alps. Christine is immediately swept up into a world of inconceivable wealth and unleashed desire. She feels herself utterly transformed: nothing is impossible. But then, abruptly, her aunt cuts her loose. Christine returns to the post office, where yes, nothing will ever be the same again.<br /><br />Christine meets Ferdinand, a bitter war veteran and disappointed architect, who works construction jobs when he can get them. They are drawn to each other, even as they are crushed by a sense of deprivation, of anger and shame. Work, politics, love, sex: everything is impossible for them. Life is meaningless, unless, through one desperate and decisive act, they can secretly remake their world from within.<br /><br />Cinderella meets Bonnie and Clyde in Zweig’s haunting and hard-as-nails novel, completed during the 1930s, as he was driven by the Nazis into exile, but left unpublished at the time of his death.

Scarred by a childhood accident that left her with a deformed arm, the quick-tempered Luzia finds her escape in sewing and in secret prayers to the saints she believes once saved her life.<br /><br />But when Luzia is abducted by a group of cangaceiros led by the infamous Hawk, the sisters' quiet lives diverge in ways they never imagined. Emília stumbles into marriage with Degas Coelho, the son of a doctor whose wealth is rivaled only by his political power.<br /><br />She moves to the sprawling seaside city of Recife, where the glamour of her new life is soon overshadowed by heartache and loneliness. Luzia, forced to trek through scrubland and endure a nomadic existence, proves her determination to survive and begins to see the cangaceiros as comrades, not criminals.<br /><br />In Recife, Emília must hide any connection to her increasingly notorious sister. As she learns to navigate the treacherous waters of Brazilian high society, Emília sees the country split apart after a bitter presidential election. Political feuds extend to the countryside, where Luzia and the Hawk are forced to make unexpected alliances and endure betrayals that threaten to break the cangaceiros apart.

Perlstein's account begins with the '65 Watts riots, nine months after Johnson's landslide victory over Goldwater appeared to herald a permanent liberal consensus. Yet the next year, scores of liberals were tossed from Congress, America was more divided than ever &amp; a disgraced politician was on his way to a shocking comeback.<br /> Between '65 &amp; '72, America experienced a 2nd civil war. From its ashes, today's political world was born. It was the era not only of Nixon, Johnson, Agnew, Humphrey, McGovern, Daley &amp; Geo Wallace but Abbie Hoffman, Ronald Reagan, Angela Davis, Ted Kennedy, Chas Manson, John Lindsay &amp; Jane Fonda. There are glimpses of Jimmy Carter, Geo H.W. Bush, Jesse Jackson, John Kerry &amp; even of two ambitious young men named Karl Rove &amp; Bill Clinton--&amp; an unambitious young man named Geo W. Bush.<br /> Cataclysms tell the story: Blacks trashing their neighborhoods. White suburbanites wielding shotguns. Student insurgency over the Vietnam War. The assassinations of Rbt F. Kennedy &amp; Martin Luther King. The riots at the '68 Democratic Nat'l Convention. The fissuring of the Democrats into warring factions manipulated by the dirty tricks of Nixon &amp; his Committee to ReElect the President. Nixon pledging a dawn of nat'l unity, governing more divisively than any president before him, then directing a criminal conspiracy, the Watergate cover-up, from the Oval Office. Then, in 11/72, Nixon, harvesting the bitterness &amp; resentment born of turmoil, was reelected in a landslide, not only setting the stage for his '74 resignation but defining the terms of the ideological divide characterizing America today.<br /> Filled with prodigious research, driven by a powerful narrative, Perlstein's account of how America divided confirms his place as one of our country's most celebrated historians.",4.18,895,Hardcover, ,680,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2393575.Nixonland,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2393575.Nixonland

Roosevelt’s New Deal. <br /><br />When President Roosevelt took the oath of office in March 1933, he was facing a devastated nation. Four years into the Great Depression, a staggering 13 million American workers were jobless and many millions more of their family members were equally in need. Desperation ruled the land.<br /><br />What people wanted were jobs, not handouts: the pride of earning a paycheck; and in 1935, after a variety of temporary relief measures, a permanent nationwide jobs program was created. This was the Works Progress Administration, and it would forever change the physical landscape and the social policies of the United States. <br /><br />The WPA lasted for eight years, spent $11 billion, employed 8½ million men and women, and gave the country not only a renewed spirit but a fresh face. Under its colorful head, Harry Hopkins, the agency’s remarkable accomplishment was to combine the urgency of putting people back to work with its vision of physically rebuilding America. Its workers laid roads, erected dams, bridges, tunnels, and airports. They stocked rivers, made toys, sewed clothes, served millions of hot school lunches. When disasters struck, they were there by the thousands to rescue the stranded. And all across the country the WPA’s arts programs performed concerts, staged plays, painted murals, delighted children with circuses, created invaluable guidebooks. Even today, more than sixty years after the WPA ceased to exist, there is almost no area in America that does not bear some visible mark of its presence.<br /><br />Politically controversial, the WPA was staffed by passionate believers and hated by conservatives; its critics called its projects make-work and wags said it stood for We Piddle Around. The contrary was true. We have only to look about us today to discover its lasting presence.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.85,630,Hardcover, ,58,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2404354.American_Made,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2404354.American_Made

While everyone else is fooled by this imposter, Leo knows better than to trust his senses in matters of the heart. Certain that the original Rema is alive and in hiding, Leo embarks on a quixotic journey to reclaim his lost love. <br /><br />With the help of his psychiatric patient Harvey—who believes himself to be a secret agent who can control the weather—Leo attempts to unravel the mystery of the spousal switch. His investigation leads him to the enigmatic guidance of the meteorologist Dr. Tzvi Gal-Chen, the secret workings of the Royal Academy of Meteorology in their cosmic conflict with the 49 Quantum Fathers, and the unwelcome conviction that somehow he—or maybe his wife, or maybe even Harvey—lies at the center of all these unfathomables. From the streets of New York to the southernmost reaches of Patagonia, Leo’s erratic quest becomes a test of how far he is willing to take his struggle against the seemingly uncontestable truth he knows in his heart to be false. <br /><br />Atmospheric Disturbances is at once a moving love story, a dark comedy, a psychological thriller, and a deeply disturbing portrait of a fracturing mind. With tremendous compassion and dazzling literary sophistication, Rivka Galchen investigates the moment of crisis when you suddenly realize that the reality you insist upon is no longer one you can accept, and the person you love has become merely the person you live with.

During the past few decades, respected frontier scientists all over the globe have produced extraordinary evidence to show that an energy field — the Zero Point Field — connects everything in the universe, and we ourselves are part of this vast dynamic network of energy exchange.<p>Lynne McTaggart, indefatigable investigative journalist, has spent four years researching this area where science meets the New Age to create this story of scientific explorers, their groundbreaking work, and its controversial implications. Until now, conservative scientists have done their best to rule ""god"" out of their equations. This book shows why the Zero Point Field makes all things possible: all things connected in space and time.</p><p><i>The Field</i> also reveals a radical new biological paradigm — that on our most fundamental level, the human mind and body are not distinct and separate from their environment, but a bundle of pulsating power constantly interacting with this vast energy sea. Here, in so-called dead space, may lay the key to many of life's processes, from how cells communicate to how organisms actually take shape. The Field is responsible for our mind's highest functions — our memory, intuition, and creativity. It is the force that finally determines whether we are healthy or ill, the force that must be tapped in order to heal. Original and well documented with eminently distinguished sources, <i>The Field</i> also lifts many areas from the level of myth into the realm of hard science. It offers a scientific explanation for many ofthe most profound human mysteries, from how alternative medicine, spiritual healing, and extrasensory perception work to the existence of the collective unconscious. A highly readable scientific detective story, <i>The Field</i> is the ultimate breakthrough book. It presents a bold new theory that will change your perception of the way your mind and body work.</p>",4.04,227, , ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2413697.The_Field,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2413697.The_Field

Cities and urbanizing regions are complex coupled hum- natural systems in which people are the dominant agents. As humans transform natural landscapes into highly human-dominated environments, they create a new set of ecological conditions by changing ecosystem processes and dynamics. Urbanization changes natural habitats and species composition, alters hydrological systems, and modifies energy flows and nutrient cycles. Although the impacts of urban development on ecosystems occur locally, they cause environmental changes at larger scales. Envir- mental changes resulting from urbanization influence human behaviors and dynamics and affect human health and well-being. Remarkable progress has been made in studying the impact of urban de- lopment on ecosystem functions (McDonnell and Pickett 1993, McDonnell et al. 1997, Grimm et al. 2000, Pickett et al. 2001, Alberti et al. 2003), yet the interactions and feedback between human processes and ecosystem dynamics in urbanizing regions are still poorly understood. In this book I argue that new syntheses across the natural and social sciences are necessary if urban and ecological dynamics are to be successfully integrated into a common fra- work to advance urban ecology research. If we remain within the traditional disciplinary boundaries, we will not make progress towards a theory of urban ecosystems as coupled human-ecological systems, because no single disc- line can provide an unbiased and integrated perspective.",3.44,366,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2425589.Advances_in_Urban_Ecology,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2425589.Advances_in_Urban_Ecology

She sees the figure of an unknown man on the tower and his face at the window. It is Peter Quint, the master's dissolute valet, and he has come for little Miles. But Peter Quint is dead.<br /><br />Like the other tales collected here - 'Sir Edmund Orme', 'Owen Wingrave', and 'The Friends of the Friends' - 'The Turn of the Screw' is to all immediate appearances a ghost story. But are the appearances what they seem? Is what appears to the governess a ghost or a hallucination? Who else sees what she sees? The reader may wonder whether the children are victims of corruption from beyond the grave, or victims of the governess's `infernal imagination', which torments but also entrals her?<br /><br />'The Turn of the Screw' is probably the most famous, certainly the most eerily equivocal, of all ghostly tales. Is it a subtle, self-conscious exploration of the haunted house of Victorian culture, filled with echoes of sexual and social unease? Or is it simply, 'the most hopelessly evil story that we have ever read'?",3.60,336,Paperback, ,100,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2437237.The_Turn_of_the_Screw_and_Other_Stories,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2437237.The_Turn_of_the_Screw_and_Other_Stories
