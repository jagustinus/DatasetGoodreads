By the time he turned sixty, he had lost everything except his Ivy League education and his sense of entitlement. First, he was downsized at work. Next, an affair ended his twenty-year marriage. Then, he was diagnosed with a slow-growing brain tumor, prognosis undetermined. Around the same time, his girlfriend gave birth to a son. Gill had no money, no health insurance, and no prospects. <br /><br /> One day as Gill sat in a Manhattan Starbucks with his last affordable luxury—a latté—brooding about his misfortune and quickly dwindling list of options, a 28-year-old Starbucks manager named Crystal Thompson approached him, half joking, to offer him a job. With nothing to lose, he took it, and went from drinking coffee in a Brooks Brothers suit to serving it in a green uniform. For the first time in his life, Gill was a minority--the only older white guy working with a team of young African-Americans. He was forced to acknowledge his ingrained prejudices and admit to himself that, far from being beneath him, his new job was hard. And his younger coworkers, despite having half the education and twice the personal difficulties he’d ever faced, were running circles around him. <br /><br /> The other baristas treated Gill with respect and kindness despite his differences, and he began to feel a new emotion: gratitude. Crossing over the Starbucks bar was the beginning of a dramatic transformation that cracked his world wide open. When all of his defenses and the armor of entitlement had been stripped away, a humbler, happier and gentler man remained. One that everyone, especially Michael’s kids, liked a lot better. <br /><br /> The backdrop to Gill's story is a nearly universal cultural phenomenon: the Starbucks experience. In <i>How Starbucks Saved My Life</i>, we step behind the counter of one of the world's best-known companies and discover how it all really works, who the baristas are and what they love (and hate) about their jobs.

A little cobbled street in a smoky mill town in the North of England has haunted me for the greater part of my life. It was inevitable that I should write about it and the people who lived on both sides of its ""Invisible Wall."" <br /><br />The narrow street where Harry Bernstein grew up, in a small English mill town, was seemingly unremarkable. It was identical to countless other streets in countless other working-class neighborhoods of the early 1900s, except for the ""invisible wall"" that ran down its center, dividing Jewish families on one side from Christian families on the other. Only a few feet of cobblestones separated Jews from Gentiles, but socially, it they were miles apart.<br /><br />On the eve of World War I, Harry's family struggles to make ends meet. His father earns little money at the Jewish tailoring shop and brings home even less, preferring to spend his wages drinking and gambling. Harry's mother, devoted to her children and fiercely resilient, survives on her dreams: new shoes that might secure Harry's admission to a fancy school; that her daughter might marry the local rabbi; that the entire family might one day be whisked off to the paradise of America.<br /><br />Then Harry's older sister, Lily, does the unthinkable: She falls in love with Arthur, a Christian boy from across the street. <br /><br />When Harry unwittingly discovers their secret affair, he must choose between the morals he's been taught all his life, his loyalty to his selfless mother, and what he knows to be true in his own heart.<br /><br />A wonderfully charming memoir written when the author was ninety-three, The Invisible Wall<i> </i>vibrantly brings to life an all-but-forgotten time and place.

Listening to his sermons, sharing coconut-flavored ices on their walks through town, roaming through the house that held together many members of a colorful extended family, Edwidge grew profoundly attached to Joseph. He was the man who “knew all the verses for love.” <br /><br />And so she experiences a jumble of emotions when, at twelve, she joins her parents in New York City. She is at last reunited with her two youngest brothers, and with her mother and father, whom she has struggled to remember. But she must also leave behind Joseph and the only home she’s ever known. <br /><br />Edwidge tells of making a new life in a new country while fearing for the safety of those still in Haiti as the political situation deteriorates. But Brother I’m Dying soon becomes a terrifying tale of good people caught up in events beyond their control. Late in 2004, his life threatened by an angry mob, forced to flee his church, the frail, eighty-one-year-old Joseph makes his way to Miami, where he thinks he will be safe. Instead, he is detained by U.S. Customs, held by the Department of Homeland Security, brutally imprisoned, and dead within days. It was a story that made headlines around the world. His brother, Mira, will soon join him in death, but not before he holds hope in his arms: Edwidge’s firstborn, who will bear his name—and the family’s stories, both joyous and tragic—into the next generation. <br /><br />Told with tremendous feeling, this is a true-life epic on an intimate scale: a deeply affecting story of home and family—of two men’s lives and deaths, and of a daughter’s great love for them both.",4.12,272,Hardcover, ,709,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/430027.Brother_I_m_Dying,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/430027.Brother_I_m_Dying

Starting with the counter culture of the 1960s and the call for a complex urbanism by Jane Jacobs and a complex architecture by Robert Venturi, it shows how such demands started to be realised by the 1990s, aided by computer design.

Carried forward by architects such as Frank Gehry, Daniel Libeskind and Peter Eisenman, it has also become a leading approach in many schools and offices around the world.

The popular image of the men who made the bomb is of dispassionate intellects who number-crunched their way towards a weapon whose devastating power they could not even imagine. But in his Tony Award-winning play Copenhagen, Michael Frayn shows us that these men were passionate, philosophical, and all too human, even though one of the three historical figures in his drama, Werner Heisenberg, was the head of the Nazis' effort to develop a nuclear weapon. The play's other two characters, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and his wife, Margrethe, are involved with Heisenberg in an after-death analysis of an actual meeting that has long puzzled historians. In 1941, the German scientist visited Bohr, his old mentor and long-time friend, in Copenhagen. After a brief discussion in the Bohrs' home, the two men went for a short walk. What they discussed on that walk, and its implications for both scientists, have long been a mystery, even though both scientists gave (conflicting) accounts in later years. Frayn's cunning conceit is to use the scientific underpinnings of atomic physics, from Schr?dinger's famous cat to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, to explore how an individual's point of view renders attempts to discover the ultimate truth of any human interaction fundamentally impossible. To Margrethe, Heisenberg was always an untrustworthy student, eager to steal from her husband's knowledge. To Bohr, Heisenberg was a brilliant if irresponsible foster son, whose lack of moral compass was part of his genius. As for Heisenberg, the man who could have built the bomb but somehow failed to, his dilemma is at the heart of the play's conflict. Frayn's clever dramatic structure, which returns repeatedly to particular scenes from different points of view, allows several possible theories as to what his motives could have been.

That the Beatles were an unprecedented phenomenon is a given. In <i>Can’t Buy Me Love</i>, Jonathan Gould seeks to explain why, placing the Fab Four in the broad and tumultuous panorama of their time and place, rooting their story in the social context that girded both their rise and their demise.<br /><br />Beginning with their adolescence in Liverpool, Gould describes the seminal influences––from Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry to <i>The Goon Show</i> and <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i>––that shaped the Beatles both as individuals and as a group. In addition to chronicling their growth as singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists, he highlights the advances in recording technology that made their sound both possible and unique, as well as the developments in television and radio that lent an explosive force to their popular success. With a musician’s ear, Gould sensitively evokes the timeless appeal of the Lennon-McCartney collaboration and their emergence as one of the most creative and significant songwriting teams in history. And he sheds new light on the significance of <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> as rock’s first concept album, down to its memorable cover art.<br /><br />Behind the scenes Gould explores the pivotal roles played by manager Brian Epstein and producer George Martin, credits the influence on the Beatles’ music of contemporaries like Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, and Ravi Shankar, and traces the gradual escalation of the fractious internal rivalries that led to the group’s breakup after their final masterpiece, Abbey Road. Most significantly, by chronicling their revolutionary impact on popular culture during the 1960s, <i>Can’t Buy Me Love</i> illuminates the Beatles as a charismatic phenomenon of international proportions, whose anarchic energy and unexpected import was derived from the historic shifts in fortune that transformed the relationship between Britain and America in the decades after World War II.<br /><br />From the Beats in America and the Angry Young Men in England to the shadow of the Profumo Affair and JFK’s assassination, Gould captures the pulse of a time that made the Beatles possible—and even necessary. As seen through the prism of the Beatles and their music, an entire generation’s experience comes astonishingly to life. Beautifully written, consistently insightful, and utterly original, <i>Can’t Buy Me Love</i> is a landmark work about the Beatles, Britain, and America.",4.18,672,Hardcover, ,98,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437112.Can_t_Buy_Me_Love,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437112.Can_t_Buy_Me_Love

Jane Austen would have, no doubt, demurred in her cool, ironic way at this verdict; she herself wrote that she was planning to take a heroine in Emma 'which no one but myself would like'. Vital, interesting, complex and predisposed to play a power game with other people's emotions, Emma is none the less one of Jane Austen's immortal creations. Dominating the novel as she dominates the small provincial world of Highbury, her forays into the matchmaking arena bring her up sharply against the follies of her egotism and selfishness. The consequent crisis, her bitter regrets and the novel's happy resolution are plotted with Jane Austen's incomparable art in this sharp and gloriously sparkling comedy of self-deceit and self-discovery.",4.01,472,Paperback, ,98,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437131.Emma,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437131.Emma

How he and Pavarotti changed the landscape of opera is one of the most significant and entertaining stories in the history of classical music, and Herbert Breslin relates the tale in a brash, candid, witty fashion that is often bitingly frank and profane. He also provides a portrait of his friend and client—“a beautiful, simple, lovely guy who turned into a very determined, aggressive, and somewhat unhappy superstar”—that is by turns affectionate and satirical and full of hilarious details and tales out of school, with Pavarotti emerging as something like the ultimate Italian male. The book is also enlivened by the voices of other players in the soap opera drama that was Pavarotti’s career, and they are no less uncensored than Herbert Breslin.

Primarily, it is the story of Joseph Jacotot, an exiles French schoolteacher who discovered in 1818 an unconventional teaching method that spread panic throughout the learned community of Europe.<br /><br />Knowing no Flemish, Jacotot found himself able to teach in French to Flemish students who knew no French; knowledge, Jacotot concluded, was not necessary to teach, nor explication necessary to learn. The results of this unusual experiment in pedagogy led him to announce that all people were equally intelligent. From this postulate, Jacotot devised a philosophy and a method for what he called ""intellectual emancipation""—a method that would allow, for instance, illiterate parents to themselves teach their children how to read. The greater part of the book is devoted to a description and analysis of Jacotot's method, its premises, and (perhaps most important) its implications for understanding both the learning process and the emancipation that results when that most subtle of hierarchies, intelligence, is overturned.<br /><br />The book, as Kristin Ross argues in her introduction, has profound implications for the ongoing debate about education and class in France that has raged since the student riots of 1968, and it affords Rancière an opportunity (albeit indirectly) to attack the influential educational and sociological theories of Pierre Bourdieu (and others) that Rancière sees as perpetuating inequality.<br /><br />",4.04,176,Paperback, ,51,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445408.The_Ignorant_Schoolmaster,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445408.The_Ignorant_Schoolmaster

Now he brings his memories of the horse world and his expertise in collectible books to this mesmerizing new Bookman novel rich with the lore of both books and horses. . . . Denver bookman Cliff Janeway would have liked Candice Geiger. She loved books with a true bookwoman's passion. Her collection of first-edition children's books is the best that Janeway ever hopes to see. Sadly, Janeway and Candice Geiger will never meet. She died much too young. Now, twenty years later, her books remain a testament to an extraordinary woman's remarkable vision.<br /><br />Janeway first learns about the juvenilia collection when Candice's elderly husband, H. R. Geiger, passes away and Janeway travels to their Idaho home to assess the collection. The estate can't be distributed until the books are valued, so there's pressure on Janeway to do the job quickly. But one look at the books tells Janeway something's wrong. Valuable titles are missing, replaced by cheap reprints. Other hugely valuable pieces remain. Why would a thief take one priceless book and leave an equally valuable volume on the shelf?<br /><br />The answer may lie in Candice's story. The daughter of a wealthy industrialist, she married horse owner and trainer H. R. Geiger at a young age. They traveled the racetrack circuit with some success, as evidenced by winner's-circle photographs -- in which Candice is always a mysterious background figure dressed in white.<br /><br />Two decades after Candice's strange death, Janeway finds himself deep in a book mystery that may turn out to be much more than acataloging exercise. It may even involve murder. Candice's daughter, Sharon, may be one of the few people who can help Janeway discover the truth. Sharon has her own Idaho ranch where she takes in sick and injured horses. Janeway worries that her house contains something that could make her very vulnerable: half of her mother's fabulous book collection.<br /><br />The trail of Candice's shadowy past leads Janeway to California's Golden Gate and Santa Anita racetracks, where he signs on as a racehorse hot walker. A novice at racetrack life, he tries to remain inconspicuous while listening to the chatter among the hands. He doesn't like what he hears. And when he goes to the house where Candice died to look for answers, he finds more than he bargained for.<br /><br />With its rich mix of books and horses, ""The Bookwoman's Last Fling"" is a classic entry in John Dunning's acclaimed Bookman series of suspense novels, sure to bring this superbly talented author even more accolades.",3.71,507,Mass Market Paperback, ,181,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445573.The_Bookwoman_s_Last_Fling,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445573.The_Bookwoman_s_Last_Fling

Dr. Karp has found there IS a remedy for colic. “I share with parents techniques known only to the most gifted baby soothers throughout history …and I explain exactly how they work.”<br /><br /> In a innovative and thought-provoking reevaluation of early infancy, Dr. Karp blends modern science and ancient wisdom to prove that newborns are not fully ready for the world when they are born. Through his research and experience, he has developed four basic principles that are crucial for understanding babies as well as improving their sleep and soothing their senses:<br /><br /><b>The Missing Fourth Trimester:</b> as odd as it may sound, one of the main reasons babies cry is because they are born three months too soon.<br /><br /><b>The Calming Reflex:</b> the automatic reset switch to stop crying of any baby in the first few months of life.<br /><br /><b>The 5 “S’s”:</b> the simple steps (swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking) that trigger the calming reflex. For centuries, parents have tried these methods only to fail because, as with a knee reflex, the calming reflex only works when it is triggered in precisely the right way. Unlike other books that merely list these techniques Dr. Karp teaches parents exactly how to do them, to guide cranky infants to calm and easy babies to serenity in minutes…and help them sleep longer too.<br /><br /><b>The Cuddle Cure:</b> the perfect mix the 5 “S’s” that can soothe even the most colicky of infants.<br /><br /> In the book, Dr. Karp also explains:<br /><br /> What is colic?<br /><br /> Why do most babies get much more upset in the evening?<br /><br /> How can a parent calm a baby—in mere minutes?<br /><br /> Can babies be spoiled?<br /><br /> When should a parent of a crying baby call the doctor?<br /><br /> How can a parent get their baby to sleep a few hours longer?<br /><br /> Even the most loving moms and dads sometimes feel pushed to the breaking point by their infant’s persistent cries. Coming to the rescue, however, Dr. Karp places in the hands of parents, grandparents, and all childcare givers the tools they need to be able to calm their babies almost as easily as…turning off a light.",3.91,267,Paperback, ,179,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445919.The_Happiest_Baby_on_the_Block,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445919.The_Happiest_Baby_on_the_Block

From the folktale of the Handless Maiden, he explains the very different frustrations of women and describes how these disparities in the way we suffer account for much of the tension and miscommunication between men and women.

In the summer of 1816, Percy and Mary Shelley, Mary's sister, and Lord Byron hid themselves away in a Swiss villa, whiling away rainy afternoons with the Gothic novel contest that would produce Frankenstein. Andahazi's reimagining focuses on the fifth competitor: John Polidori, Byron's manservant, a talentless hack resentful of the ease of his master's life.

This book is: - FOR STUDENTS OF LITERATURE: THE LITERARY ENNEAGRAM offers an exciting new key to Western literature through clarifying the basic psychological patterns of characters in classic and contemporary novels, stories, and plays. - FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS: THE LITERARY ENNEAGRAM demonstrates simply and eloquently that the true basis of human psychological differences lies in inner experience rather than outer behavior. Judith Searle's work validates the Enneagram as a universal template for human psychology by showing how characters created by authors unfamiliar with the Enneagram conform to the character arcs the system predicts. - FOR WRITERS: THE LITERARY ENNEAGRAM offers screenwriters, fiction writers and playwrights a powerful tool for character development, a template for creating character grids, and a basis for devising character-driven plot twists that seem both inevitable and surprising. - FOR ACTORS: THE LITERARY ENNEAGRAM offers guidelines for creating characters that live and breathe on stage and screen as well as on the page. Performers who understand their own Enneagram style can make the ""type casting"" that is so prevalent in the entertainment industry work for them. - And, FOR READERS OF FICTION: THE LITERARY ENNEAGRAM offers a richer understanding of literary characters and valuable insights into ways their psychology relates to the reader's own personality patterns and relationships with others.

In a folksy narration peppered with sailor's jargon, the amiable, altogether down-to-earth merchant marine describes a series of amusingly disconcerting revelations about the next world.<br /><br /><br />Sitting on a cloud strumming a harp all day turns out to be insufferably boring; being eternally youthful also has its drawbacks when the captain finds himself not mixing well with a crowd of insipid teenagers; and Native Americans so outnumber whites in the North American district of Paradise that the average white Anglo-Saxon male has trouble finding someone to talk to. In fact the outlandish dimensions and characteristics of heaven utterly explode every human conception.<br /><br /><br />This funny, satirical spoof on human pretensions about the importance of our species in the grand scheme of things was the last published work by Mark Twain. The main character and plot were inspired by the dream of an actual sea captain whom Twain had known. Published at the beginning of the 20th century, when astronomy had just begun to reveal the huge expanse of outer space and traditional religious concepts of our place in the universe had become inadequate, Twain's humorous vision of the afterlife seems to reflect the new scientific awareness of the awesome cosmos that confronts us and the feelings of insignificance that this discovery produced.<br /><br />Two years after publication of this ""extract,"" originally planned as a six-chapter book, Twain himself shipped off to follow in Captain Stormfield's wake.",3.86,153,Paperback, ,32,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/453751.Extract_from_Captain_Stormfield_s_Visit_to_Heaven,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/453751.Extract_from_Captain_Stormfield_s_Visit_to_Heaven

He soon learned that many were dead or dying—among them his own mother and sister. Those who remained were stranded on a lifeless glacier at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level, with no supplies and no means of summoning help. They struggled to endure freezing temperatures, deadly avalanches, and then the devastating news that the search for them had been called off.<br /><br />As time passed and Nando's thoughts turned increasingly to his father, who he knew must be consumed with grief, Nando resolved that he must get home or die trying. He would challenge the Andes, even though he was certain the effort would kill him, telling himself that even if he failed he would die that much closer to his father. It was a desperate decision, but it was also his only chance. So Nando, an ordinary young man with no disposition for leadership or heroism, led an expedition up the treacherous slopes of a snow-capped mountain and across forty-five miles of frozen wilderness in an attempt to find help.<br /><br />Thirty years after the disaster Nando tells his story with remarkable candor and depth of feeling. <i>Miracle in the Andes</i>—a first person account of the crash and its aftermath—is more than a riveting tale of true-life adventure: it is a revealing look at life at the edge of death and a meditation on the limitless redemptive power of love.",4.27,304,Paperback, ,840,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/454236.Miracle_in_the_Andes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/454236.Miracle_in_the_Andes

It was no wonder he gravitated to machines, which could, at least, be counted on.<br /><br />After fleeing his parents and dropping out of high school, his savant-like ability to visualize electronic circuits landed him a gig with KISS, for whom he created their legendary fire-breathing guitars. Later, he drifted into a “real” job, as an engineer for a major toy company. But the higher Robison rose in the company, the more he had to pretend to be “normal” and do what he simply couldn’t: communicate. It wasn’t worth the paycheck.<br /><br />It was not until he was forty that an insightful therapist told him he had the form of autism called Asperger’s syndrome. That understanding transformed the way Robison saw himself—and the world.<br /><br /><i>Look Me in the Eye</i> is the moving, darkly funny story of growing up with Asperger’s at a time when the diagnosis simply didn’t exist. A born storyteller, Robison takes you inside the head of a boy whom teachers and other adults regarded as “defective,” who could not avail himself of KISS’s endless supply of groupies, and who still has a peculiar aversion to using people’s given names (he calls his wife “Unit Two”). He also provides a fascinating reverse angle on the younger brother he left at the mercy of their nutty parents—the boy who would later change his name to Augusten Burroughs and write the bestselling memoir <i>Running with Scissors</i>.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is the story of Robison’s journey from his world into ours, and his new life as a husband, father, and successful small business owner—repairing his beloved high-end automobiles.

When Hollywood fails to notice him, he settles for the next best thing: writing scripts for adult films. Determined to make the most of his bad luck, he sets out to make a movie that will be celebrated more for its witty dialogue and gripping plot than its raw depictions of hardcore sex. As Spitznagel discovers, making the Great American Porn is far from easy, especially when you've been hired to write a sequel to <i>Butt Crazy</i>.<br /><br />Spitznagel struggles to be taken seriously as an artist, a seeming impossibility in an industry averse to “complicated words.” Along the way, he meets a director with delusions of being the porn Kurosawa, an actress with a scholarly knowledge of medical maladies, and an NBA star who might just make the biggest mistake of his life. In an industry devoted to churning out disposable erotica, can one lowly writer make an adult film that compels viewers to admire the plot without hovering a thumb over the fast forward button?<br /><br /><b>Eric Spitznagel</b> is the author of four humor books, including <i>The Junk Food Companion: A Celebration of Eating Badly</i> (Plume, 1999).

But unfortunately, these characters are real and their stories are true.<br /><br /> In August 1996, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb stunned the world with a series of articles in the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> reporting the results of his year-long investigation into the roots of the crack cocaine epidemic in America, specifically in Los Angeles. The series, titled ""Dark Alliance,"" revealed that for the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to Los Angeles street gangs and funneled millions in drug profits to the CIA-backed Nicaraguan Contras.<br /><br /> Gary Webb pushed his investigation even further in his book, <i>Dark Alliance: The CIA, The Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion</i>. Drawing from then newly declassified documents, undercover DEA audio and videotapes that had never been publicly released, federal court testimony, and interviews, Webb demonstrates how our government knowingly allowed massive amounts of drugs and money to change hands at the expense of our communities. <br /><br /> Webb's original article spurred an immediate outcry. Within days of publication, both of California's senators made formal requests for investigations of the U.S. government's relationship with the cocaine ring. As a result, public demonstrations erupted in L.A., Washington D.C., and New York. Then-chief of the CIA, John Deutsch, made an unprecedented attempt at crisis control by going to South Central L.A. to hold a public forum. Representative Maxine Waters later said in <i>George</i> magazine, ""I was shocked by the level of corruption and deceit and the way the intelligence agencies have knowledge of big-time drug dealing.""<br /> The allegations in Webb's story blazed over the Internet and the <i>Mercury News'</i> website on the series was deluged with hits—over a million in one day. A <i>Columbia Journalism Review</i> cover story called it ""the most talked-about piece of journalism in 1996 and arguably the most famous—some would say infamous—set of articles of the decade.""<br /><br /> Webb's own stranger-than-fiction experience is also woven into the book. His excoriation by the media—not because of any wrongdoing on his part, but by an insidious process of innuendo and suggestion that in effect blamed Webb for the implications of the story—had been all but predicted. Webb was warned off doing a CIA expose by a former <i>Associated Press</i> journalist who lost his job when, years before, he had stumbled onto the germ of the ""Dark Alliance"" story. And though Internal investigations by both the CIA and the Justice Department eventually vindicated Webb, he had by then been pushed out of the <i>Mercury News</i> and gone to work for the California State Legislature Task Force on Government Oversight. He died in 2004. <br /><br /> The updated paperback edition of <i>Dark Alliance</i> features revelations in just-released reports from the Department of Justice, internal CIA investigations, and a new cache of recently declassified secret FBI, DEA, and INS files—much of which was not known to Webb when writing the first edition of this book. Webb further explains the close working relationship that major drug traffickers had with U.S. Government agencies—particularly the DEA—and recounts the news of the past year regarding this breaking story.<br /><br /> After more than two years of career-damning allegations leveled at Webb, joined in the past year by glowing reviews of the hardcover edition of <i>Dark Alliance</i> from shore to shore, the core findings of this courageous investigative reporter's work—once fiercely denied—are becoming matters of public record. The updated paperback edition of <i>Dark Alliance</i> adds yet another layer of evidence exposing the illegality of a major CIA covert operation.",4.26,592,Paperback, ,89,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455652.Dark_Alliance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455652.Dark_Alliance

مدار صفر درجهٔ زنده یاد احمد محمود از رمان‌هایی است که به نیاز وضعیت کنونی جامعهٔ تشنه و در رکود ما برای آشنایی با جامعهٔ زنده و پر تلاش و تکاپو پاسخ می‌دهد و ایجاب می‌کند تا افراد با مطالعهٔ کتاب‌هایی از این نوع به دریافتی روشن و مستدل از حرکت اجتماعی در ابعاد مختلف و در حوزه‌های گوناگون فکری و روحی دست پیدا کنند. در این اثر درخشان هنری به باز نگری و روایت رویدادهای سال‌های ۳۲ تا ۵۷ آن سان عمیق نگریسته شده، گویی با افراد زنده‌‌ای ورای صفحات کتاب رودروئیم که در پیرامونمان هرگاه دقیق شویم حضورشان کاملاً برایمان ملموس است. <br /><br />افراد مبارزی مثل مبارک خیاط طوری برایمان معرفی می‌شوند که حضور خالق اثر در بیان روحیاتشان و در سیر روند رویدادها مطلقا احساس نمی‌شود. این مطلب حاکی از چیره دستی و تبحر نویسنده می‌باشد که از کلی گویی و قهرمان پروری با پیشرفته‌ترین متد هنری در کل اثر آگاهانه پرهیز نموده. مبارزهٔ مبارک خیاط در متن مناسبات اجتماعی و رفتارهایش در عرصه زندگی خانوادگی آن سان طبیعی و ساده با همهٔ روحیات مثبت و منفی مبارزان آن دوره ترسیم می‌شود که در یافته می‌شود انسان‌های مبارز و مقاوم نیز دارای روحیات و خصال خوب و بد می‌باشند و قهرمان مطلق مفهومی جز در رویاها نمی‌تواند وجود داشته باشد. تئوری علمی نقد هنری به ما می‌آموزد در یک رمان موفق نمی‌بایست جامعه به صورت تک صدا معرفی شود. وقتی به عملکردهای افرادی چون باران و مبارک و مهراب و عطا و کندرو می‌نگریم به عیان ملاحضه می‌شود نویسنده در این اثر با حداکثر مراعات موازین هنری به مرزهای نوین و آموزنده‌‌ای در این عرصه دست یافته. هم چنین دربررسی روحیات مبارزان نسل پیشین که تجربهٔ شکست سال ۳۲ را دارند با مبارزان نسل نو مثل نامدار که آن سال‌ها را تجربه نکرده‌‌اند هم اثر کاملا بی‌عیب و نقص می‌باشد. <br /><br />مش نوذر نموداری است از افرادی که اعتقادات محکم و پا بر جایی دارند ولی ظرفیت و توان مقاومت در عرصه‌های مبارزهٔ اجتماعی را ندارند به همین دلیل روحیات متلون و اعمال بعضا متضاد و متناقضی را از خود بروز می‌دهند که برای پی بردن به کنه علل روحیات و اعمالشان می‌بایست به ریشه یابی مسائل در سرکوب‌های وحشیانهٔ استبداد شاهی و پیامدهای ویرانگرش در هستی اجتماعی کشور پرداخت. با کمی دقت به پیرامون خود در این شرایط رکود و ایستایی بسیار از این موارد را می‌توان یافت. کار احمد محمود در بازنمایاندن این سان چهره‌‌ای در یک رمان بی‌نهایت شگرف و عمیق و آموزنده است. در حکایت رنج و درد و محرومیت مردم در پی کودتای ۲۸ مرداد و استقرار حکومت پلیسی رمان جاندارترین و ملموسترین صحنه‌ها را به نمایش می‌گذارد. از دلهره و ترس، از یاس و دلتنگی و از دلشوره‌های مردم و امیدشان آن چنان زنده سخن می‌گوید که خواننده با غم و حسرت و آرزوهای انسانی قهرمانان داستان به واقع یکی می‌شود و خود را جزئی از افراد مطروحه در رمان می‌یابد. در به تصویر کشیدن نقش زنان در جامعه به اوجی دست نیافتنی در یک اثر هنری بر می‌خوریم. مائده و آفاق با افکار ترقیخواهانه و شخصیت استخوان داری که دارند همه در این جامعه بوده‌‌اند و هستند در کنار کتایون و خاور و بی‌بی سلطنت و بلقیس با واپس گرایی فکری خاص زنانه اشان. با تعمق و تاملی به شخصیت مائده و منیژه دریافته می‌شود جامعه از وضعیت مرد سالاری می‌رود که به درآید و زنان نیز همراه و دوشادوش مردان در زندگی اجتماعی حضوری واقعی دارند و می‌روند تا هردم حضور و وجودشان را بیشتر از قبل تثبیت نمایند که رمان مدار صفر درجه به زیبایی و روشنی این روند را به تصویر می‌کشد. عناصر میرنده در یک جامعهٔ متحول همواره تا سر حد نهایت مقاومت می‌نمایند تا مرگ تاریخی خود را به دلیل حفظ امتیازات نا عادلانهٔ خود به عقب اندازند. ارتجاع در عرصهٔ فرهنگ و سوء رفتار مردم از این منظر معنا و مفهوم می‌یابد. باورها و عملکردهای مش دوشنبه، بی‌بی سلطنت و بلقیس در این چارچوب می‌گنجد بر این اساس و با این تحلیل و برداشت می‌توان به دریافتی منطقی از اعمال آن چنانی افراد رسید که تحت تاثیر تبلیغات پوسیده و کهنهٔ واپس گرایان در طول تاریخ بوده‌‌اند و خود نیز به سهم خویشتن ناآگاهانه به باز تولید افکار و معتقدات ما قبل تاریخ می‌پردازند. حاج آقا عطار با منزه طلبی ریا کارانهٔ خود در حیطه مسائل اخلاقی و فکری و درک درست و هوشمندانه منافع طبقاتی خویش که همین حقیقت انگیزه واقعی‌‌اش در موضع گیری سیاسی و اعتقادی می‌باشد نمودار گرایش اجتماعی طیف وسیعی از بازاریانی است که بر مبنای منافع طبقاتی و تاریخی خود که باسیاست‌های شاهی در تعارض بود علیه شاه و دار و دسته‌‌اش جبهه گیری می‌نمایند. یارولی و شهروز در عرصه‌‌ای دیگر با الگوهای فکری متفاوت از امثال حاج اقا عطار ولی نهایتا هم سو با وی از منافع شخصی و تجاری خود دفاع می‌نمایند. در ترسیم شخصیت‌های تمامی افراد و علل حرکات و مواضع فکری و سیاسی و رویکردهای نظری رمان کاملا با دیدی علمی و جامع به موشکافی مطلب می‌پردازد. بدون آن که نه تنها از الگوهای هنری عدول کند بلکه با نوآوری و خلاقیت نویسنده خود این مرزهای هنری در این کتاب شکوفا‌تر نیز می‌شود. <br /><br />به همین خاطر استخوان بندی رئالیسمی که احمد محمود در این رمان آن را پی می‌ریزد بر خلاف آثار چند دهه پیش نویسندگانی که رئالیسم آن‌ها تک خطی و یک بعدی می‌بود، چند وجهی و در ابعاد مختلف هنری پی ریزی و شکل گیری شده که بسی کار پر ارج و ستودنی است ودقیقا حسن کار در این جاست. ما به همین خاطر با یک رمان خوب و به یاد ماندنی و اثری دلنشین که سالیان درازی در بین ما خواهد ماند رو بروایم.,4.02,1782,Paperback,

How does drama matter in our lives? In <i>Three Uses of the Knife, </i> one of America's most respected writers reminds us of the secret powers of the play. Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, screenwriter, poet, essayist, and director, David Mamet celebrates the absolute necessity of drama--and the experience of great plays--in our lurching attempts to make sense of ourselves and our world.<br /><br />In three tightly woven essays of characteristic force and resonance, Mamet speaks about the connection of art to life, language to power, imagination to survival, the public spectacle to the private script.<br /><br />It is our fundamental nature to dramatize everything. As Mamet says, ""Our understanding of our life, of our drama.... resolves itself into thirds: Once Upon a Time.... Years Passed.... And Then One Day."" We inhabit a drama of daily life--waiting for a bus, describing a day's work, facing decisions, making choices, finding meaning. The essays in the book are an eloquent reminder of how life is filled with the small scenes of tragedy and comedy that can be described only as drama.<br /><br />First-rate theater, Mamet writes, satisfies the human hunger for ordering the world into cause-effect-conclusion. A good play calls for the protagonist ""To create, in front of us, on the stage, his or her own character, the strength to continue. It is her striving to understand, to correctly assess, to face her own character (in her choice of battles) that inspires us--and gives the drama power to cleanse and enrich our own character."" Drama works, in the end, when it supplies the meaning and wholeness once offered by magic and religion--an embodied journey from lie to truth, arrogance to wisdom.<br /><br />Mamet also writes of bad theater; of what it takes to write a play, and the often impossibly difficult progression from act to act; the nature of soliloquy; the contentless drama and empty theatrics of politics and popular entertainment; the ubiquity of stage and literary conventions in the most ordinary of lives; and the uselessness, finally, of drama--or any art--as ideology or propaganda.",3.90,96,Hardcover, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/456817.Three_Uses_of_the_Knife,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/456817.Three_Uses_of_the_Knife

In the course of this investigation he discovers an ominous thread: the presence at the death scenes of the anthology <i>Poems and Rhymes Around the World</i>, all opened to the page where there appears an African chant, or “culling song.” This song turns out to be lethal when spoken or even <i>thought</i> in anyone's direction – and once it lodges in Streator's brain he finds himself becoming an involuntary serial killer.

He had never spoken in public before. His mind was flooded with childhood memories filled with humiliation, misunderstanding, and abuse at the hands of his teachers. With his heart pounding, he began to speak of these incidents. To his disbelief, the teachers before him responded to his embittered recollection with a standing ovation. Many could not contain their own tears.<br /><br />So begins a touching memoir of an extremely angry adolescent. Highly gifted and imaginative, Villaseñor coped with an untreated learning disability (he was finally diagnosed with extreme dyslexia at the age of forty-four) and the frustration he felt growing up Latino in an English-only American school system that had neither the cultural understanding nor the resources to deal with Hispanic students.<br /><br />Often beaten by his teachers because he could not speak English, Villaseñor was made to feel ashamed about his heritage, and even questioned the core values prioritized by his tight-knit family. Villaseñor's dyslexia, and growing frustration over not fitting in, fueled his dream to one day become a writer. He is now considered one of the premier writers of our time.<br /><br />With his signature passion, his gift as a storyteller, and his own incredible story, Villaseñor allows readers into the soul of a young life touched by insecurity yet encouraged by a personal sense of artistic destiny. <em>Burro Genius</em>, a complex and inspiring coming-of-age story, is certain to become an American classic.",4.11,336,Hardcover, ,131,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457614.Burro_Genius,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457614.Burro_Genius

The magic of the drum remains alive today, and with her magnificent second novel, Berry brings those powerful beats to the streets of Harlem.<br /><br />Harry “Freedom” Hudson is the hottest hip hop producer in New York City, earning unbelievable fees for his tunes and the innovative sound that puts his artists on the top of the charts. Harry is used to getting what he wants, so when he’s irresistibly drawn to a house in Harlem, he assumes he’ll be moving in as soon as the papers can be drawn up. The house, after all, has been abandoned for years. Or has it? <br /><br />Rumors are rife in the neighborhood that the house is haunted; that mysterious music, shouts, and sobbing can be heard late at night. Ava, Harry’s strong-willed, no-nonsense agent, dismisses it all as “old folks” tales–until she opens the door and finds an eerie, silent group of black people, young and old, gathered around a man holding an ancient African drum. They are waiting for Harry and bear a warning that touches his very soul: “We gave the drum back to your generation in the form of rap, but it’s being used to send the wrong message.” <br /><br /><i>The Haunting of Hip Hop</i> is a reminder of the importance of honoring the past as a means of moving safely and firmly into the future.

But for over a century, no one knew who the original John Henry was--or even if there was a real John Henry.<br /> In Steel Drivin' Man, Scott Reynolds Nelson recounts the true story of the man behind the iconic American hero, telling the poignant tale of a young Virginia convict who died working on one of the most dangerous enterprises of the time, the first rail route through the Appalachian Mountains. Using census data, penitentiary reports, and railroad company reports, Nelson reveals how John Henry, victimized by Virginia's notorious Black Codes, was shipped to the infamous Richmond Penitentiary to become prisoner number 497, and was forced to labor on the mile-long Lewis Tunnel for the C&amp;O railroad. Nelson even confirms the legendary contest between John Henry and the steam drill (there was indeed a steam drill used to dig the Lewis Tunnel and the convicts in fact drilled faster). <br /> Equally important, Nelson masterfully captures the life of the ballad of John Henry, tracing the song's evolution from the first printed score by blues legend W. C. Handy, to Carl Sandburg's use of the ballad to become the first ""folk singer,"" to the upbeat version by Tennessee Ernie Ford.

If pre-industrial societies were held together by common values, sentiments, and norms, equally shared by all, what holds modern societies, with their complex division of labor and non-cohesive social structure, together? What did this new social order mean for the autonomy of the individual? Durkheim argued that class conflict is not inherent in a capitalist society, as Marx contended, but that the unfettered growth of state power would lead to the extinction of individuality. Only in a free society that promotes voluntary bonds between its members, Durkheim suggested, can individuality prosper.<br /><br />In this new edition, the first since 1984, world-renowned Durkheim scholar Steven Lukes revisits and revises the original translation to enhance clarity, accuracy, and fluency for the contemporary reader. Lukes also highlights Durkheim’s arguments by putting them into historical context with a timeline of important information. For students and scholars, this edition of <i>The Division of Labor</i> is essential reading and key to understanding the relevance of Durkheim’s ideas today.",3.83,412,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/465044.The_Division_of_Labor_in_Society,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/465044.The_Division_of_Labor_in_Society

An outstanding athlete with a stubborn and competitive spirit, he lost his leg to cancer at 19, but said “nobody is ever going to call me a quitter.”<br /><br />On April 12, 1980, Terry Fox set out from St. John’s, Newfoundland to begin the run across Canada that he named the Marathon of Hope. His ambition was to raise a million dollars for cancer research. It wasn’t easy. Initial support from communities varied from terrific to nothing at all. His prosthetic leg was painful to run on, and there were always traffic and extreme weather conditions to deal with. But, by the time he reached Ontario – a journey of more than 3,000 kilometres – word of his achievement had spread, and thousands cheered him and followed his progress. Terry’s spirits soared, and now he hoped to raise $22 million dollars – one dollar for every Canadian. He succeeded in this ambition, but the Marathon of Hope ended near Thunder Bay, Ontario on September 1, 1980. The cancer had spread to his lungs, and, after running 24 miles in one day, on the next he could run no further.<br /><br />When cancer finally claimed his life in 1981, Canada mourned the loss of a hero, but the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope lives on.

But dissatisfaction with the modern world may also spring from a conviction that modernism has failed to confront the challenge of an inevitably open future. Such conviction has frequently led to a critique of modernity's founding heroes. Challenging that critique, Harries insists that modernity is supported by nothing other than human freedom. But more important to Harries is to show how modernist self-assertion is shadowed by nihilism and what it might mean to step out of that shadow. Looking at a small number of medieval and Renaissance texts, as well as some paintings, he uncovers the threshold that separates the modern from the premodern world.

From the ruined representatives of Greek divinity (broken statues and fragmented stories), and the dazzling extravagances of predecessors like Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens, to the fleeting promises of popular music and the laconic demigods of the contemporary gay subculture, they sketch maps of a world in which desire may find a restless home.

He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this book perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire. <p> ""I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue,"" Russell declares in his Preface, and his reasoned opposition to any system or dogma which he feels may shackle man's mind runs through all the essays in this book, whether they were written as early as 1899 or as late as 1954. </p><p> The book has been edited, with Lord Russell's full approval and cooperation, by Professor Paul Edwards of the Philosophy Department of New York University. In an Appendix, Professor Edwards contributes a full account of the highly controversial ""Bertrand Russell Case"" of 1940, in which Russell was judicially declared ""unfit"" to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New York. </p><p> Whether the reader shares or rejects Bertrand Russell's views, he will find this book an invigorating challenge to set notions, a masterly statement of a philosophical position, and a pure joy to read.</p>",4.02,266,Paperback, ,483,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472025.Why_I_Am_Not_a_Christian_and_Other_Essays_on_Religion_and_Related_Subjects,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472025.Why_I_Am_Not_a_Christian_and_Other_Essays_on_Religion_and_Related_Subjects

Davidson traveled to Japan to teach English at a leading all-women’s university. It was the first of many journeys and the beginning of a deep and abiding fascination. In this extraordinary book, Davidson depicts a series of intimate moments and small epiphanies that together make up a panoramic view of Japan. With wit, candor, and a lover’s keen eye, she tells captivating stories—from that of a Buddhist funeral laden with ritual to an exhilarating evening spent touring the “Floating World,” the sensual demimonde in which salaryman meets geisha and the normal rules are suspended. On a remote island inhabited by one of the last matriarchal societies in the world, a disconcertingly down-to-earth priestess leads her to the heart of a sacred grove. And she spends a few unforgettable weeks in a quasi-Victorian residence called the Practice House, where, until recently, Japanese women were taught American customs so that they would make proper wives for husbands who might be stationed abroad. In an afterword new to this edition, Davidson tells of a poignant trip back to Japan in 2005 to visit friends who had remade their lives after the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995, which had devastated the city of Kobe, as well as the small town where Davidson had lived and the university where she taught.<i>36 Views of Mount Fuji</i> not only transforms our image of Japan, it offers a stirring look at the very nature of culture and identity.

Now, if you're thinking fondly of <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> or <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, you're on the wrong track. Neil Gaiman's <i>Coraline</i> is far darker, far stranger, playing on our deepest fears. And, like Roald Dahl's work, it is delicious. <p> What's on the other side of the door? A distorted-mirror world, containing presumably everything Coraline has ever dreamed of... people who pronounce her name correctly (not ""Caroline""), delicious meals (not like her father's overblown ""recipes""), an unusually pink and green bedroom (not like her dull one), and plenty of horrible (very un-boring) marvels, like a man made out of live rats.

To make creepy creepier, <i>Coraline</i> has been illustrated masterfully in scritchy, terrifying ink drawings by British mixed-media artist and Sandman cover illustrator Dave McKean.

Few books have thrown such light upon the forces that shape modern society or penetrated so deeply into the causes of authoritarian systems.

A wry, clear-eyed, and laugh-out-loud look at the transition to adulthood</b><p>Three months before getting married at age thirty-four, Josh Wolk decides to treat himself to a ""farewell to childhood"" extravaganza: one last summer working at the beloved Maine boys' camp where he spent most of the eighties. And there he finds out that there's no better way to see how much you've changed than to revisit a place that hasn't changed at all.</p><p>In these eight hilarious, uncomfortable, enlightening weeks, Josh readjusts to life teaching swimming and balancing on a thin metal cot in a cabin of shouting, wrestling, wet-willie-dispensing fourteen-year-olds who, contrary to the warnings of doomsaying sociologists, he finds indistinguishable from the rowdy fourteen-year-olds of his day in any way other than their haircuts. With his old camp friends gone, he finds himself working alongside guys who used to be his campers. Moments of feeling cripplingly old are offset by the corrosive insecurities of his youth when he's paired in the cabin with Mitch, the forty-two-year-old jack-of-all- extreme-sports whose machismo intimidated Josh so much fifteen years earlier, and whom their current campers idolize. And throughout all this disorienting regression, Josh's telephone conversations with his fianc�e, Christine, grow increasingly intense as their often comical discussions over the wedding become a flimsy cover for her worries that he's not ready to relinquish his death-grip on the comforts of the past./PPA hilarious and insightful look at the tenacious power of nostalgia, the glory of childhood, and thenervous excitement of taking a leap to the next unknown stage in life, iCabin Pressure/i will appeal to anyone who's ever been young, wishes he was young again, but knows deep down it probably isn't a good idea./PPbJosh Wolk/b is a senior writer at iEntertainment Weekly/i.

Her first collection of short fiction for adults is <i>Sister Emily's Lightship and Other Stories</i>. It assembles 28 stories, three of which are original to this volume, many of which take the form of folk or fairy tales, and all of which are excellent. Sometimes dark, sometimes humorous, the stories are always beautifully written, sharp, and wise.<p> ""Snow in Summer"" portrays a modern, Appalachian Snow White with a fringe-Fundamentalist snake-handling stepmother. ""Granny Rumple"" reveals the grim origin of Rumplestiltskin. A prequel to the Chronicles of Great Alta, ""Blood Sister"" explores both love and the nature of narrative. In ""The Gift of the Magicians, with Apologies to You Know Who,"" Beauty and the Beast meet with a horrifically suitable O. Henry twist. The Nebula Award winning ""Lost Girls"" revisits Peter Pan's Neverland with a feminist slant. ""Dick W. and His Pussy; or, Tess and Her Adequate Dick"" is an amusingly naughty retold fairy tale. In the Nebula Award winner ""Sister Emily's Lightship,"" the poet Emily Dickinson finds a strange and otherworldly inspiration. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i><br /><br />Contents:<br />The Traveler and the Tale (1995)<br />Snow in Summer (2000)<br />Speaking to the Wind (2000)<br />The Thirteenth Fey (1985)<br />Granny Rumple (1994)<br />Blood Sister (1994)<br />Journey into the Dark (1995)<br />The Sleep of Trees (1980)<br />The Uncorking of Uncle Finn (1986)<br />Dusty Loves (1988)<br />The Gift of the Magicians, with Apologies to You Know Who (1992)<br />Sister Death (1995)<br />The Singer and the Song (2000)<br />Salvage (1984)<br />Lost Girls (1998)<br />Belle Bloody Merciless Dame (1997)<br />Words of Power (1987)<br />Great Gray (1991)<br />Under the Hill (2000)<br />Godmother Death (1997)<br />Creationism: An Illustrated Lecture in Two Parts (1990)<br />Allerleirauh (1995)<br />Sun/Flight (1982)<br />Dick W. and His Pussy; or, Tess and Her Adequate Dick (1997)<br />Become a Warrior (1998)<br />Memoirs of a Bottle Djinni (1988)<br />A Ghost of an Affair (2000)<br />Sister Emily's Lightship (1996)</p>",3.91,304,Paperback, ,42,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/476889.Sister_Emily_s_Lightship_and_Other_Stories,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/476889.Sister_Emily_s_Lightship_and_Other_Stories

Sha'ik is dead. One last rebel force remains, holed up in the city of Y'Ghatan and under the fanatical command of Leoman of the Flails. The prospect of laying siege to this ancient fortress makes the battle-weary Malaz 14th Army uneasy. For it was here that the Empire's greatest champion Dassem Ultor was slain and a tide of Malazan blood spilled. A place of foreboding, its smell is of death.

Of V.I.'s creator, the ""Chicago Tribune"" says ""Sara Paretsky has no peer."" <br />Now Paretsky brings her incomparable storytelling brilliance to her most powerful Warshawski novel yet. Total Recall follows the Chicago P.I. on a road that winds back more than fifty years -- and into an intricate maze of wartime lies, heartbreaking secrets, and harrowing retribution. <br />For V.I., the journey begins with a national conference in downtown Chicago, where angry protesters are calling for the recovery of Holocaust assets. Replayed on the evening news is the scene of a slight man who has stood up at the conference to tell an astonishing story of a childhood shattered by the Holocaust -- a story that has devastating consequences for V.I.'s cherished friend and mentor, Lotty Herschel. <br />Lotty was a girl of nine when she emigrated from Austria to England, one of a group of children wrenched from their parents and saved from the Nazi terror just before the war broke out. Now stunningly -- impossibly -- it appears that someone from that long-lost past may have returned. <br />With the help of a recovered-memory therapist, Paul Radbuka has recently learned his true identity. But is he who he claims to be? Or is he a cunning impostor who has usurped someone else's history ... a history Lotty has tried to forget for over fifty years? <br />As a frightened V.I. watches her friend unravel, she sets out to help in the only way she can: by investigating Radbuka's past. Already working on a difficultcase for a poor family cheated of their life insurance, she tries to balance Lotty's needs with her client's, only to find that both are spiraling into a whirlpool of international crime that stretches from Switzerland and Germany to Chicago's South Side. <br />As the atrocities of the past reach out to engulf the living, V.I. struggles to decide whose memories of a terrible war she can trust, and moves closer to a chilling realization of the truth -- a truth that almost destroys her oldest friend. <br />With fierce emotional power, Sara Paretsky has woven a gripping and morally complex novel of crime and punishment, memory and illusion.

L’occasione lo spinge indietro con la memoria, a Ferrara, e al cimitero ebraico in fondo a via Montebello, e in particolare alla tomba monumentale dei Finzi-Contini, dove riposa un unico membro della famiglia che aveva conosciuto negli anni precedenti la seconda guerra mondiale. Il libro è, quindi, un omaggio memoriale postumo a questo gruppo di israeliti, destinati a morire nei lager nazisti, per restituirli alla vita attraverso la forza dell’arte. La vicenda è ambientata nei tempi cupi del fascismo e delle leggi razziali che colpirono tante case ebraiche e che esclusero i giovani dalle scuole pubbliche e da tutte le associazioni culturali e ricreative. Per questo motivo Ermanno e Olga Finzi-Contini rompono la loro cortina di riservatezza e aprono i cancelli del proprio giardino a un gruppo di coetanei dei figli Alberto e Micòl. Fra questi giovani c’è anche l’io narrante, già da tempo affascinato da quel luogo, ma soprattutto dal modo d’agire enigmatico e imprevedibile di Micòl, personaggio simbolico che richiama gli archetipi mitici del viaggio iniziatico dall’adolescenza alla maturità. La delicata storia di un amore tacito e discreto, chiuso nell’ambito di un giardino, di un campo da tennis e di una casa, si apre allora nella prospettiva di una storia più ampia, che coinvolge l’intimo inafferrabile di ogni creatura umana.",3.82,256,Paperback,Oscar classici moderni  #17,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484800.Il_giardino_dei_Finzi_Contini,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484800.Il_giardino_dei_Finzi_Contini

Written for layman and scholar alike, the book addresses one of the most important issues facing Americans today: within what guidelines shall the Supreme Court apply the strictures of the Constitution to the complexities of modern life?<br /><br />Until now legal experts have proposed two basic approaches to the Constitution. The first, ""interpretivism,"" maintains that we should stick as closely as possible to what is explicit in the document itself. The second, predominant in recent academic theorizing, argues that the courts should be guided by what they see as the fundamental values of American society. John Hart Ely demonstrates that both of these approaches are inherently incomplete and inadequate. <i>Democracy and Distrust</i> sets forth a new and persuasive basis for determining the role of the Supreme Court today.<br /><br />Ely's proposal is centered on the view that the Court should devote itself to assuring majority governance while protecting minority rights. ""The Constitution,"" he writes, ""has proceeded from the sensible assumption that an effective majority will not unreasonably threaten its own rights, and has sought to assure that such a majority not systematically treat others less well than it treats itself. It has done so by structuring decision processes at all levels in an attempt to ensure, first, that everyone's interests will be represented when decisions are made, and second, that the application of those decisions will not be manipulated so as to reintroduce in practice the sort of discrimination that is impermissible in theory.""<br /><br />Thus, Ely's emphasis is on the procedural side of due process, on the preservation of governmental structure rather than on the recognition of elusive social values. At the same time, his approach is free of interpretivism's rigidity because it is fully responsive to the changing wishes of a popular majority. Consequently, his book will have a profound impact on legal opinion at all levels--from experts in constitutional law, to lawyers with general practices, to concerned citizens watching the bewildering changes in American law.",4.18,280,Paperback, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484916.Democracy_and_Distrust,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/484916.Democracy_and_Distrust

But the more the detective finds out about Weiss, the more he is reminded of the brutal killing of an Israeli woman at Karnak years ago -- a murder for which he has always suspected the wrong man had been convicted. Despite opposition from his superiors and his own misgivings about working with the Israelis, Khalifa re-opens the case and teams up with hard-nosed Jerusalem detective Arieh Ben Roi.<br /><br />At the same time journalist Eva Town receives an anonymous letter at her Jerusalem home. It requests her help in contacting “Al-Mulassam” (“The Veiled One”), a Palestinian extremist leader she has recently interviewed; in return it offers her the scoop of a lifetime.<br /><br />Against a backdrop of escalating violence between Israelis and Palestinians, Eva follows up the cryptic letter while Khalifa and Arieh slowly uncover the unpleasant truth about Jan Weiss. Their investigations intertwine as they all get further in to the web of duplicity and intrigue that has at its center an ancient artifact of such potent symbolism that it could plunge the Middle East into an all-out war.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",3.86,713,Paperback, ,256,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485994.The_Last_Secret_of_the_Temple,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485994.The_Last_Secret_of_the_Temple

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan. What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see throughall the clutter. Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.",3.98,356,Paperback,Large Print,19,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/486300.Freakonomics,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/486300.Freakonomics

The largest armada of all time approaches the knights’ Christian stronghold on the island of Malta. The Turks know the knights as the “Hounds of Hell.” The knights call themselves “The Religion.” In Messina, Sicily, a French countess, Carla La Penautier, seeks passage to Malta in a quest to find the son taken from her at his birth twelve years ago. The only man with the expertise and daring to help her is a Rabelaisian soldier of fortune, arms dealer, former janissary, and strapping Saxon adventurer by the name of Mattias Tannhauser. He agrees to accompany the lady to Malta, where, amid the most spectacular siege in military history, they must try to find the boy—whose name they do not know and whose face they have never seen—and pluck him from the jaws of Holy War.

These recollections are sure to benefit any reader, whether an aspiring athlete or a sideline sports fan—it's the ideal gift for kids of all ages. As Kilmeade writes, ""Regardless of who you are, what era you played, what sport you chose, or how much success you achieved, playing the game is all about getting you ready for life. Winning or losing has little to do with who you will become. Instead, it's how you prepared for the game that determines whether you'll be a winner or loser in life.""<br /><br />So while the games <em>do</em> count—in life as in sports, it's how you play the game that matters.",3.44,384,Hardcover, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/490544.It_s_How_You_Play_the_Game,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/490544.It_s_How_You_Play_the_Game

On Memorial Day, at her tenth birthday party in the garden of her Vermont village home, Alice meets two people unlike any she’s known before. Theo is a mixed-race New York City kid visiting his white grandparents for the summer. Kenneth is a cosmopolitan artist with AIDS who has come home to convalesce with his middle-aged sister. Alice and Theo form an instant bond and, almost as quickly, find themselves drawn into the orbit of the magisterial Kenneth. When the children begin a daily routine of reading aloud to the artist, who is losing his eyesight, they discover the journals of Lewis and Clark and decide to embark on their own wilderness adventure: they plan and secretly build a “rope walk” through the woods for Kenneth and in the process learn the first of many hard truths about the way adults see the world, no matter that they are often wrong. <br /><br />The great gift of <i>The Rope Walk</i> is its exquisitely poised writing. Alice’s narrative is a profound experience of innocence, of perception balanced between childhood and adulthood. The flying spark of new friendship, the first intimation of adult love, the consolation of devotion, which allow Alice and Theo to shed light in the midst of darkness and to find joy in mutual understanding: these glistening threads are drawn together in a timeless story–profound, seductive, wise, and moving, from first to last.",3.61,336,Hardcover, ,171,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/490621.The_Rope_Walk,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/490621.The_Rope_Walk

It's an adulterous world out there. Russian husbands and wives don't believe that beach-resort flings violate their marital vows. Japanese businessmen, armed with the aphorism ""If you pay, it's not cheating,"" flock to sex clubs where the extramarital services on offer include ""getting oral sex without showering first."" South Africans may be the masters of creative accounting: Pollsters there had to create separate categories for men who cheat, and men who only cheat while drunk. In America, however, there is never a free pass when it comes to infidelity. According to our national moral compass, cheating is abominable no matter what the circumstances. But do we actually behave differently than everyone else? Pamela Druckerman, a former foreign correspondent for ""The Wall Street Journal,"" decided to delve into this incredibly taboo topic. She interviews people all over the world, from retirees in South Florida to Muslim polygamists in Indonesia; from Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn to the men who keep their mistresses in a ""concubine village"" outside Hong Kong. Druckerman talks to psychologists, sex researchers, marriage counselors, and most of all, cheaters and the people they've cheated on, and concludes that Americans are the least adept at having affairs, have the most trouble enjoying them, and suffer the most in their aftermath.

De Quincey's Confessions assumed an authoritative influence on the public, as well as scientific opinion of opium for several generations. It went through almost innumerable editions and revisions despite the fact that he was generally criticised for putting too much emphasis on the positive aspects of opium intoxication.

It is, but that really fails to do justice to the sheer ambition of this book. The main story is a grimly familiar one. A young Jewish-American--who just happens to be called Jonathan Safran Foer--travels to the Ukraine in the hope of finding the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. He is aided in his search by Alex Perchov, a naïve Ukrainian translator, Alex's grandfather (also called Alex) and a flatulent mongrel bitch, named Sammy Davis JR JR. On their journey through Eastern Europe's obliterated landscape they unearth facts about the Nazi atrocities and the extent of Ukrainian complicity that have implications for Perchov as well as Safran Foer. This narrative is not, however, recounted from (the character) Jonathan Safran Foer's perspective. It is relayed through a series of letters that Alex sends to Foer. These are written in the kind of broken Russo-English normally reserved for Bond villains and Latka from the US television series <i>Taxi</i>. (Sentences such as ""It is mammoth honour for me write for a writer, especially when he is American writer, like Ernest Hemingway""; ""It is bad and popular habit for people in Ukraine to take things without asking"" are the norm.) Interspersed between these letters are fragments of a novel by ""Safran Foer""--a wonderfully imagined, almost magical realist, account of life in the Shetl before the Nazis destroyed it. These are in turn commented on by Alex creating an additional metafictional angle to the tale. <p> If all this sounds a little daunting don't be put off; Safran Foer is an extremely funny as well as intelligent writer. Admittedly he has an annoying habit of capitalising great chunks of text, but minor typographical nuances are easy to ignore in a book that combines some of the best Jewish folk yarns since Isaac Bashevis Singer with a quite heartbreaking meditation on love, friendship and loss. <i>--Travis Elborough</i></p>",3.89,288,Hardcover, ,126,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/493966.Everything_Is_Illuminated,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/493966.Everything_Is_Illuminated

Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.<br /><br />The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.<br /><br />Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire ""Encyclopedia Britannica"" for ""The Know-It-All."" His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges.

In 1965 George Grant passionately defended Canadian identity by asking fundamental questions about the meaning and future of Canada's political existence. In Lament for a Nation he argued that Canada - immense and underpopulated, defined by a shared border, history, and culture with the United States, and torn by conflicting loyalties to Britain, Quebec, and America - had ceased to exist as a sovereign state. Nonetheless, Lament for a Nation became the seminal work in Canadian political thought and Grant became known as the father of Canadian nationalism. The fortieth anniversary edition introduces Lament for a Nation to a new generation. A major introduction by Andrew Potter explores Grant's arguments in the context of changes in ethnic diversity, free trade, globalization, post-modernism, and 9/11. Potter discusses the shifting uses of the terms ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" and closes with a look at the current state of Canadian nationalism. This edition also includes a biographical sketch of Grant, recommended further reading, and, for the first time, an index. George Grant's Lament for a Nation remains essential reading for anyone interested in questions of Canadian identity, sovereignty, and national unity.",3.56, , , ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/497092.Lament_For_A_Nation,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/497092.Lament_For_A_Nation

An enchanting argument for the power of theatrical imagination over reality, ""The Illusion"" weaves obsession and caprice, romance and murder, fact and fiction, into an enticing exploration of the greatest illusion of all-love.",3.84,72,Paperback,Acting Edition,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/500139.The_Illusion,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/500139.The_Illusion

It highlights the futility of lying to oneself and others in matters of life and death. And it offers lessons to the current generation so that, at least in our time, this never happens again. <br /><br /> As the team of Rampton and Stauber show in their first new book since President Bush's reelection, the White House seems to have fooled no one as much as itself in the march toward a needless (from a security perspective) war in Iraq. As the authors argue, one of the most tragic consequences of the Bush administration's reliance on propaganda is its disdain for realistic planning in matters of war. Repeatedly, when faced with predictions of problems, U.S. policymakers dismissed the warnings of Iraq experts, choosing instead to promulgate its version of the war through conservative media outlets and PR campaigns. The result has been too few troops on the ground to maintain security; failure to anticipate the insurgency; and oblivious disregard, even contempt, for critics in either party who attempted to assess the human and economic costs of the war. <br /><br /> Even now that withdrawal seems imminent, however, the administration and its allies continue their cover-ups: downplaying civilian deaths and military injuries; employing marketing buzzwords like ""victory"" repeatedly to shore up public opinion; and botched attempts, through third-party PR firms, at creating phony news. <br /><br /> The Bush administration entered Iraq believing that its moral, technological, and military superiority would ensure victory abroad, and that its mastery of the politics would win support at home. Instead, it found a morass of problems that do not lend themselves to moralistic, technological, or propaganda-based solutions.",3.81,255,Paperback, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/500662.The_Best_War_Ever,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/500662.The_Best_War_Ever

It is the tragic monologue of a woman speaking with the child she carries in her womb. This letter confronts the burning theme of abortion, and the meaning of life, by asking difficult questions: Is it fair to impose life even if it means suffering? Would it be better not to be born at all?<br />Letter to a Child Never Born touches on the real meaning of being a woman: the power to give life or not. When the book begins, the protagonist is upset after learning she is pregnant. She knows nothing about the child, except that this creature depends totally and uniquely on her own choices. The creation of another person directly within one’s own body is a very shocking thing. The sense of responsibility is huge; it is a heavy burden that gives life to endless reflections, from the origin of our existence to the shame of our selfishness. If the child could choose, would he prefer to be born, to grow up, and to suffer, or would he return to the joyful limbo from which he came? A woman’s freedom and individuality are also challenged by a newborn—should she renounce her freedom, her job, and her choice? What should she do at this point?",3.93,116, , ,68,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/502674._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/502674._

Yet somehow, this normal boy became one of the youngest people on whom Dr. Walter Freeman performed his barbaric transorbital—or ice pick—lobotomy.<br /><br />Abandoned by his family within a year of the surgery, Howard spent his teen years in mental institutions, his twenties in jail, and his thirties in a bottle. It wasn’t until he was in his forties that Howard began to pull his life together. But even as he began to live the “normal” life he had been denied, Howard struggled with one question: Why?<br /><br />“October 8, 1960. I gather that Mrs. Dully is perpetually talking, admonishing, correcting, and getting worked up into a spasm, whereas her husband is impatient, explosive, rather brutal, won’t let the boy speak for himself, and calls him numbskull, dimwit, and other uncomplimentary names.”<br /><br />There were only three people who would know the truth: Freeman, the man who performed the procedure; Lou, his cold and demanding stepmother who brought Howard to the doctor’s attention; and his father, Rodney. Of the three, only Rodney, the man who hadn’t intervened on his son’s behalf, was still living. Time was running out. Stable and happy for the first time in decades, Howard began to search for answers. <br /><br />“December 3, 1960. Mr. and Mrs. Dully have apparently decided to have Howard operated on. I suggested [they] not tell Howard anything about it.”<br /><br />Through his research, Howard met other lobotomy patients and their families, talked with one of Freeman’s sons about his father’s controversial life’s work, and confronted Rodney about his complicity. And, in the archive where the doctor’s files are stored, he finally came face to face with the truth.<br /><br />Revealing what happened to a child no one—not his father, not the medical community, not the state—was willing to protect,<i> My Lobotomy</i> exposes a shameful chapter in the history of the treatment of mental illness. Yet, ultimately, this is a powerful and moving chronicle of the life of one man. Without reticence, Howard Dully shares the story of a painfully dysfunctional childhood, a misspent youth, his struggle to claim the life that was taken from him, and his redemption.",3.73,288,Hardcover, ,1115,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503248.My_Lobotomy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503248.My_Lobotomy

Eliot</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i> </i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>:<br />All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics </i>pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<br /> <br /><br />Considered the most important poem of the twentieth century, <b>T. S. Eliot</b>’s <i>The Waste Land</i> is an oblique and fascinating view of the hopelessness and confusion of purpose in modern Western civilization. Published in 1922—the same year as Joyce’s equally monumental <i>Ulysses</i>—<i>The Waste Land</i> is a series of fragmentary dramatic monologues and cultural quotations that crossfade into one another. Eliot believed that this style best represented the fragmentation of society, and his poem portrays a sterile world of panicky fears and barren lusts, and of human beings waiting for some sign or promise of redemption. Mirroring the destruction and disillusionment of World War I, <i>The Waste Land</i> had the effect of a bomb exploded in a genteel drawing room, just as its author intended.<br /><br />This volume also includes <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i> (1917) and <i>Poems</i> (1919). Prufrock contains the poem that first put Eliot on the map, “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” in which the title character is tormented by the difficulty of articulating his complex feelings. Among other masterpieces, <i>Poems</i> features ""Gerontion,"" a meditative interior monologue in blank verse—a poem like none before it in the English language.<br /><b></b> <br /><br /><b>Randy Malamud</b> is Professor of English and Associate Chair of the department at Georgia State University. His specialty is modern literature, and he has written three books and numerous articles about T. S. Eliot.",4.23,121,Paperback, ,77,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/504945.The_Waste_Land_and_Other_Poems,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/504945.The_Waste_Land_and_Other_Poems

The heart-wrenching story of Little Nell and her doting grandfather offered a rich amalgam of misery and malice, goodness and generosity, love and loyalty — all with a pervading veneer of sentimentality that greatly appealed to Victorian readers.<br />As the story opens up, Nell and her grandfather are living behind his curiosity shop, which brings in barely a pittance. To improve Nell's prospects, her grandfather gambles at night and is soon in debt to the evil dwarf Quilp. When Quilp takes over the shop, Nell and her aged guardian abandon their home and roam the countryside, where they meet up with a diverse and vivid collection of wandering entertainers and traveling shows, jovial innkeepers, clerics, schoolmasters, and sharp-eyed con men. Relentlessly pursued by the avaricious Quilp, the two struggle to survive in a hostile world that often turns a cold shoulder, but nevertheless also includes people who treat them with kindness and compassion.<br />The book has much to recommend it—it features a wonderfully picturesque cast of characters drawn with typical Dickensian flair, while the mean streets of Victorian London and the rustic charms of the English countryside are recreated in loving detail. Above all, the book offers a rich human drama of courage and perseverance in the face of adversity. Generations of readers have applauded Nell and the other plucky underdogs of the story as they oppose the vile and miserable actions of the evil and uncaring.",3.78,464,Paperback, ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/505051.The_Old_Curiosity_Shop,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/505051.The_Old_Curiosity_Shop

Chef Mario Batali, known to fans far and wide as ""Molto Mario"" from his appearances on television's Food Network and as chef of New York's much-loved Pó restaurant, has elevated these simple principles to fine art, creating innovative new fare that pays tribute to traditional Italian home cooking in a distinctly modern way. Now, for the first time, more than 200 of his irresistible recipes for fresh pastas, sprightly salads, grilled dishes, savory ragus, and many others are gathered in <b>Simple Italian Food</b>, a celebration of the flavors and spirit of Italy.<br />        <br />Mario draws inspiration for his distinctive dishes from the two ""villages"" that have left their stamps on his cuisine: Borgo Capanne, the tiny hillside village in Northern Italy where he lived and cooked for several years, and New York's Greenwich Village, where he has ready access to bountiful produce and outstanding artisan-made products; his full-flavored, smartly presented fare combines the best of both worlds. Chapters covering antipasti, pasta and risotto, fish, meat and poultry, contorni (side dishes), and cheese and sweets offer classic dishes such as Baked Lasagne with Asparagus and Pesto and pork loin cooked in caramelized onions and milk alongside Batali's own enticing improvisations--Penne with Spicy Goat Cheese and Hazelnut Pesto or Tuna Carpaccio with Cucumbers, Sweet Potatoes, and Saffron Vinaigrette. And because his recipes succeed on the strength of their ingredients rather than on virtuoso techniques, home cooks can easily duplicate the clear, clean flavors and lively presentations that are Mario's signature. Thirty-two pages of color photographs showcase Chef Batali's colorful and approachable recipes.<br />        <br />Traditionalists as well as those who thrill to the new will want to make dozens of these crowd-pleasing dishes a permanent part of their repertoire and embrace Mario Batali'sphilosophy of <b>Simple Italian Food</b>.",4.01,288,Hardcover, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509287.Mario_Batali_Simple_Italian_Food,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/509287.Mario_Batali_Simple_Italian_Food

She hires herself a “manny.”<br /><br />A solid middle-class girl from Middle America, Jamie Whitfield isn’t “one of them” but she lives in “the Grid,” the wealthiest acre of real estate in Manhattan, where big money and big media collide. And she has most everything they have–a big new apartment, full-time help with her three children, as well as her very own detached Master of the Universe attorney husband.

Amir Abbas Hoveyda was a central figure in the historic struggle between modernity and tradition in Iran -- a struggle pitting Western cosmopolitanism against Persian isolationism, secularism against religious fundamentalism, and ultimately civil society and democracy against authoritarianism. Born in Tehran in 1919 to a family of solid middle class comforts and faded aristocratic roots, Hoveyda was an elegant, cultivated, well-read and witty man, educated in Beirut, London and Brussels. After entering the Iranian foreign service in 1942, he served in France, Germany and Turkey, then returned to Iran in 1956 to join the National Iranian Oil Company. In 1965, the shah appointed him the country's prime minister. Hoveyda would serve faithfully in that post for thirteen years. Amir Abbas Hoveyda embodied the aspirations, the accomplishments and also the failures of a whole generation of Iranian technocrats -- mostly Western-trained -- who sought to free Iran from the travails of poverty and repression and guide it into the modern age. Hoveyda would be both a leader and a victim of that effort. On the eve of the Islamic Revolution, the shah, attempting to turn the rising tide of revolt by offering a scapegoat, ordered the prime minister's arrest. When the Pahlavi regime fell, Hoveyda chose not to flee, voluntarily surrendering to the new Islamic authorities. His hope was for a public trial; instead the infamous ""Hanging Judge"" presided over a secret and summary trial. In telling the story of Hoveyda's life, the author has not only laid bare the development of Iranian society duringa pivotal period (1919-1978) but has also unearthed important new material on U.S.-Iranian relations. From 1957 onward, Amir Abbas Hoveyda played critical roles in dealing with U.S. foreign policy and fundamentalist Islamic opposition in Iran. Through careful use of hitherto-unexamined archival materials, unpublished letters, and personal journals, along with extensive interviews with more than a hundred of Hoveyda's relatives, friends, and foes, the author has brilliantly caught the pathos and passion of Hoveyda's life and times.",4.08,400,Hardcover, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/510119.The_Persian_Sphinx,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/510119.The_Persian_Sphinx
