This ""Penguin Classics"" edition is translated with notes by Ronald Wilks, and an introduction by J. Douglas Clayton. These stories from the middle period of Chekhov's career include - influenced by his own experiences as a doctor - ""Ward No. 6"", a savage indictment of the medical profession set in a mental hospital; ""The Black Monk"", portraying an academic who has strange hallucinations, explores ideas of genius and insanity; ""Murder"", in which religious fervour leads to violence; while in ""The Student"", Chekhov's favourite story, a young man recounts a tale from the gospels and undergoes a spiritual epiphany. In all the stories collected here, Chekhov's characters face madness, alienation and frustration before they experience brief, ephemeral moments of insight, often earned at great cost, where they confront the reality of their existence. <br /><br />This is the second in three chronological volumes of Chekhov's short stories in ""Penguin Classics"".Ronald Wilks's lucid translation is accompanied by an introduction discussing the increasingly experimental style of Chekhov's writing during this time. This edition also contains an annotated bibliography, chronology and explanatory notes. Anton Chekhov (1860-1904) was born in Taganrog, a port on the sea of Azov. In 1879 he travelled to Moscow, where he entered the medical faculty of the university, graduating in 1884. During his university years, he supported his family by contributing humorous stories and sketches to magazines. He published his first volume of stories, ""Motley Tales"", in 1886, and a year later his second volume ""In the Twilight"", for which he received the Pushkin Prize. Today his plays, including ""Uncle Vanya"", ""The Seagull"", and ""The Cherry Orchard"" are recognised as masterpieces the world over.

Just as hell had its circles, purgatory, situated at the threshold of heaven, has its terraces, each representing one of the seven mortal sins. With Virgil again as his guide, Dante climbs the mountain; the poet shows us, on its slopes, those whose lives were variously governed by pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust.

Could it be his incessant moralizing? His generally poor posture? The fact that he was raised by a pack of wolves? Frankly, we haven't got a clue. What we do know is that Almond has a knack for converting his dustups into essays that are both funny and furious. In ""(Not that You Asked),"" he squares off against Sean Hannity on national TV, nearly gets arrested for stealing ""Sta-Hard"" gel from his local pharmacy, and winds up in Boston, where he quickly enrages the entire population of the Red Sox Nation. Almond is, as they say in Yiddish, a tummler. <br />Almond on personal grooming: ""Why, exactly, did I feel it would be 'sexy' and 'hot' to have my girlfriend wax my chest? I can offer no good answer to this question today. I could offer no good answer at the time."" <br />On sports: ""To be a fan is to live in a condition of willed helplessness. We are (for the most part) men who sit around and watch other men run and leap and sweat and grapple each other. It is a deeply homoerotic pattern of conduct, often interracial in nature, and essentially humiliating.""<br />On popular culture: ""I have never actually owned a TV, a fact I mention whenever possible, in the hopes that it will make me seem noble and possibly lead to oral sex."" <br />On his literary hero, Kurt Vonnegut: ""His books perform the greatest feat of alchemy known to man: the conversion of grief into laughter by means of courageous imagination.""<br />On religion: ""Every year, when Chanukah season rolled around, my brothers and I would make the suburban pilgrimage to the home of our grandparents, where we would ring in the holiday with a big, juicy Chanukah ham."" <br />The essays in ""(Not that You Asked)"" will make you laugh out loud, or, maybe just as likely, hurl the book across the room. Either way, you'll find Steve Almond savagely entertaining.

Part Three continues with an analysis of the problems of American civil-military relations in the era of World War II and the Korean War: the political roles of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the difference in civil-military relations between the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, the role of Congress, and the organization and functioning of the Department of Defense.

So argues Josefina Vicens' alter ego, Jose Garcia, in The Empty Book. Yet his need to write exists independently of his perception that an ordinary person has nothing to say. In the very act of writing about nothing, Garcia paradoxically tells a story that does have meaning and significance-the story of his own attempt to transcend the limits of mundane existence through creative work. Winner of the prestigious Xavier Villaurrutia prize, The Empty Book was first published in Mexico as El libro vacio in 1958. A novel about the writing process, it stands as a forerunner of the metafiction boom of the 1960s that included the works of such writers as Cortazar, Pacheco, and Elizondo. The accessibility of its language and themes makes this novel highly democratic and empowering, rescuing literature from the realm of high art and opening it to participation by ordinary people.

This passionate book leads us outside the city walls to the countryside, where the vast majority of the Greek citizenry lived, to find the true source of the cultural wealth of Greek civilization. Victor Hanson shows that the real ""Greek revolution"" was not merely the rise of a free and democratic urban culture, but rather the historic innovation of the independent family farm. <br />The farmers, vinegrowers, and herdsmen of ancient Greece are ""the other Greeks,"" who formed the backbone of Hellenic civilization. It was these tough-minded, practical, and fiercely independent agrarians, Hanson contends, who gave Greek culture its distinctive emphasis on private property, constitutional government, contractual agreements, infantry warfare, and individual rights. Hanson's reconstruction of ancient Greek farm life, informed by hands-on knowledge of the subject (he is a fifth-generation California vine- and fruit-grower) is fresh, comprehensive, and absorbing.

But where once we settled down to admire the 'top-quality original songwriting' that the contest was inaugurated to showcase, throughout the long post-ABBA decades Eurovision has come to entertain us for all the wrong reasons: we chortle at its magnificent foolishness, its stubborn reinforcement of the crudest national stereotypes, at a scoreboard shamelessly corrupted by cross-border friendship and hatred. And as post-modern connoisseurs of showbiz meltdown, our focus has shifted from the blandly competent winners to the spangled, hapless, table-propping losers, those left to wander the lonely, windswept summit of Mount Fiasco. The gold standard of farcical failure, the benchmark of badness, to score nul points is to suffer international ignominy and find sympathetic understanding replaced by brutal guffaws. Remorseful of his own longstanding contributions to the latter chorus, yet darkly fascinated with those lives shadowed by the entertainment world's most grandiose humiliation, Tim Moore sets off to track down the thirteen Eurominstrels who have come and gone without troubling the scorers since Norway's Jahn Teigen twanged his silver braces and leapt splay-legged off the Palais des Congres stage in 1978. From Lisbon to Lithuania, from the Black Sea to the Baltic, Moore travels the continent to hear their extraordinary stories - 'poignant, ludicrous and heartwarming in almost equal measure' - recounting as he does so the no less improbable history of Eurovision itself, a towering cathedral of cheese that can nonetheless claim responsibility for keeping Norway out of the EU and catalysing the overthrow of a Portuguese dictatorship.",3.52,320,Paperback, ,16,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210332.Nul_Points,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210332.Nul_Points

These books, which form the bulk of current writing, always make you feel as if you had paid for looking into the wrong end of a telescope. Mitchell, on the other hand, likes to start with an unimportant hero, but he collects all the facts about him, arranges them to give the desired effects, and usually ends by describing the customs of a whole community. Commodore Dutch, the subject of one portrait, ‘is a brassy little man who has made a living for the last forty years by giving an annual ball for the benefit of himself.’ Mitchell doesn’t try to present him as anything more than a barroom scrounger; but in telling the story of his career, he also gives a picture of New York sporting life since the days of Big Tim Sullivan. The story called ‘King of the Gypsies’ is even better. It sets out to describe Cockeye Johnny Nikanov, the spokesman or king of thirty-eight gypsy families, but it soon becomes a Gibbon’s decline and fall of the American gypsies; and it ends with an apocalyptic vision that is not only comic but also, in its proper context, more imaginative than anything to be found in recent novels. <br /> “Reading some of his portraits a second time, you catch an emotion beneath them that curiously resembles Dickens’: a continual wonder at the sights and sounds of a big city, a continual devouring interest in all the strange people who live there, a continual impulse to burst into praise of kind hearts and good food and down with hypocrisy.” —Malcolm Cowley, <i>The New Republic</i>",4.38,370,Hardcover, ,38,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210784.McSorley_s_Wonderful_Saloon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210784.McSorley_s_Wonderful_Saloon

From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br /><br />Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that ""since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin."" Since then, Branson has written his own ""rules"" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br /><br />Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, ""Don't do it."" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br />And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:<br /><br /> Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br /><br />Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br /><br />Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br /><br />Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br /><br />Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic<br /><br />Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .<br /><br />And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.",3.98,416,Paperback, ,891,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211099.Losing_My_Virginity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211099.Losing_My_Virginity

In an attempt to escape her not-so-innocent past in Glasgow, Bessy Buckley—a wide-eyed and feisty young Irish girl—takes a job as a maid in a big house outside Edinburgh working for the beautiful Arabella—the ""missus."" Bessy lacks the necessary scullery skills for her new position, but as she finds out, it is her ability to read and write that makes her such a desirable property. Bessy is intrigued by her new employer but puzzled by her increasingly strange requests and her insistence that Bessy keep a journal of her mundane chores and most intimate thoughts. And it seems that the missus has a few secrets of her own, including her near- obsessive affection for Nora, a former maid who died in mysterious circumstances. <br /><br />Giving in to her curiosity, Bessy makes an infuriating discovery and, out of jealousy, concocts a childish prank that backfires and threatens to jeopardize all that she has come to hold dear. Yet even when caught up in a tangle of madness, ghosts, sex, and lies, she remains devoted to Arabella. But who is really responsible for what happened to her predecessor Nora? As her past threatens to catch up with her and raise the stakes even further, Bessy begins to realize that she has not quite landed on her feet. <br /><br />The Observations is a brilliantly original, endlessly intriguing story of one woman’s journey from a difficult past into an even more disturbing present, narrated by one of the most vividly imagined heroines in recent fiction. This powerful story of secrets and suspicions, hidden histories and mysterious disappearances is at once compelling and heart-warming, showing the redemptive power of loyalty and friendship.

Is disinterested action really possible? What do the family, the church, and the intellectual world have in common? Can morality be founded on hypocrisy? What is the ""subject"" of action? In this new volume, one of France's foremost social thinkers of our time responds to these major questions and to others, thus tracing the outlines of a work that could be called ""Pierre Bourdieu by himself.""<br /><br />In these texts, the author tries to go to the essential, that is, the most elementary and fundamental, questions. He thereby explains the philosophical principles that have led to his social science research and the idea of the human that guides his choices there. With the lucidity allowed by retrospect, Bourdieu brings out the fundamental theories of his greatest books, notably <i>Outline of a Theory of Practice</i> and <i>The Logic of Practice</i> (Stanford, 1990), and, with an eye to the future, presents the first results of his most recent work on the state, the anthropological moorings of the economy, and male domination.<br /><br />Bourdieu's theory is both a philosophy of science dedicated to revealing the objective relations that shape and underpin social life, and a philosophy of action that takes account of agents' dispositions as well as the structured situations in which they act. This philosophy of action is condensed in a small number of key concepts—habitus, field, capital—and it is defined by the two-way relationship between the objective structures of social fields and the incorporated structures of the habitus.<br /><br />All in all, this book should be an indispensable introduction to Bourdieu's work, not only to students and scholars in sociology, anthropology, political science, and philosophy, but throughout the social sciences and humanities generally.<br /><br />",3.96,168,Paperback, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212958.Practical_Reason,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/212958.Practical_Reason

But nowhere is this drive to do better more important than in medicine, where lives are on the line with every decision. In his new book, Atul Gawande explores how doctors strive to close the gap between best intentions and best performance in the face of obstacles that sometimes seem insurmountable. Gawande's gripping stories of diligence, ingenuity, and what it means to do right by people take us to battlefield surgical tents in Iraq, to labor and delivery rooms in Boston, to a polio outbreak in India, and to malpractice courtrooms around the country. He discusses the ethical dilemmas of doctors participation in lethal injections, examines the influence of money on modern medicine, and recounts the astoundingly contentious history of hand washing. And as in all his writing, Gawande gives us an inside look at his own life as a practicing surgeon, offering a searingly honest firsthand account of work in a field where mistakes are both unavoidable and unthinkable. At once unflinching and compassionate, Better is an exhilarating journey narrated by arguably the best nonfiction doctor-writer around (Salon).

Det är ett kammarspel som tar upp och suveränt varierar en del av de teman Bergman ständigt återvänder till. Det är till en del ett drama om den framgångsrike konstnärens, pianisten Charlotte, isolering och onåbarhet. I första hand är det dock ett spel, som visar klyftan mellan människor överhuvutaget och generationerna i synnerhet. Tragedin är främst Evas och den sjuka Helenas, Charlottes döttrar, som på olika sätt gör sitt för att nå modern. Detta drama om att leva i skuggan av skulden och omöjligheten för allt att forma sitt liv oberoende av sin miljö har en levande dialog med ofta långa repliker som närmar sig den inre monologen. Det är förunderligt hur levande helheten blir utan att man har stöd av de bergmanska bilderna. Texten har verkligen ett värde i sig, och den blir ett ypperligt komplement till filmen 'Höstsonaten'.""

Lee was a public relations executive and Bob had just been named co-anchor of ABC’s <i>World News Tonight</i>. Then, while Bob was embedded with the military in Iraq, an improvised explosive device went off near the tank he was riding in. He and his cameraman, Doug Vogt, were hit, and Bob suffered a traumatic brain injury that nearly killed him.<br /><br /><i>In an Instant</i> is the frank and compelling account of how Bob and Lee’s lives came together, were blown apart, and then were miraculously put together again–and how they persevered, with grit but also with humor, through intense trauma and fear. Here are Lee’s heartfelt memories of their courtship, their travels as Bob left a law practice behind and pursued his news career and Lee her freelance business, the glorious births of her children and the challenges of motherhood.<br /><br />Bob in turn recalls the moment he caught the journalism “bug” while covering Tiananmen Square for CBS News, his love of overseas assignments and his guilt about long separations from his family, and his pride at attaining the brass ring of television news–being chosen to fill the seat of the late Peter Jennings.<br /><br />And, for the first time, the Woodruffs reveal the agonizing details of Bob’s terrible injuries and his remarkable recovery. We learn that Bob’s return home was not an end to the journey but the first step into a future they have learned not to fear but to be grateful for.<br /><br /><i>In an Instant</i> is much more than the dual memoir of love and courage. It is an important, wise, and inspiring guide to coping with tragedy–and an extraordinary drama of marriage, family, war, and nation.<br /><br />A percentage of the proceeds from this book will be donated to the Bob Woodruff Family Fund for Traumatic Brain Injury.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.11,304,Hardcover, ,373,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214049.In_an_Instant,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214049.In_an_Instant

Numerous studies have documented high rates of psychological distress among these survivors of extreme violence and forced migration, yet very few have access to clinic-based mental health care. In any case, clinic-based services cannot adequately address the constellation of displacement-related stressors that affect refugees daily, whether in a new region of their homeland or a new country--stressors such as social isolation, the loss of previously valued social roles, poverty and a lack of employment opportunities, and difficulties obtaining education and medical care. Additionally, many refugees from non-western societies find western methods of psychiatric and psychological healing culturally alien or stigmatizing, and therefore underutilize such services.<br /><br />This book brings together an international group of experts on the mental health of refugees who have pioneered a new approach to healing the psychological wounds of war and forced migration. Their work is guided by an ecological model, which, in contrast to the prevailing medical model of psychiatry and clinical psychology, emphasizes the development of culturally grounded mental health interventions in non-stigmatized community settings. The ecological model also prioritizes synergy with natural community resources to promote adaptation, prevention over treatment, the active involvement of community members in all phases of the intervention process, and the empowerment of marginalized communities to address their own mental health needs.<br /><br />Drawing on their expertise in community psychology, prevention science, anthropology, social psychology, social psychiatry, public health and child development, the authors present a variety of highly innovative, culturally grounded interventions designed to improve the mental health and psychosocial well-being of communities that have survived the nightmares of political repression, civil war, and genocide. They discuss the various conceptions of well-being and distress that have informed their projects, their own integrations of western and indigenous approaches to understanding and relieving psychological distress, and in several instances their creative use of well-trained paraprofessionals. They examine with remarkable candor the challenges they have faced in carrying out their work in extraordinarily demanding conditions.<br /><br />An extended introductory chapter reviews and analyzes what we know about the impact of political violence and exile on mental health, and lays out the ecological model in rich theoretical and empirical context. The first of two concluding chapters addresses the critical and often-neglected issue of the <i>evaluation</i> of community-based interventions in conflict and post-conflict settings; the second sums up the implications of the achievements and limitations of the programs described, poses questions that must be answered, such as ""How adequate is the PTSD construct in capturing the nature of refugee trauma?"", and suggests numerous directions for future research and practice.<br /><br /><i>The Mental Health of Refugees: Ecological Approaches to Healing and Adaptation</i> is an essential reference for all professionals who seek to serve members of this vulnerable population, for those who train and supervise them, and for program administrators and policymakers concerned with refugee well-being. It is also an excellent resource for graduate courses in public mental health, community psychology and psychiatry, refugee and immigrant studies, psychological trauma, medical anthropology, and ethnopolitical violence.<br />",4.00,448,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215359.The_Mental_Health_of_Refugees,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215359.The_Mental_Health_of_Refugees

In its characters, themes, and preoccupations it prefigures Cortzar's later fictions, including Blow-Up and his masterpiece Hopscotch. Written in 1950 (just before the fall of Pern's government), Final Exam is Cortzar's allegorical, bitter, and melancholy farewell to an Argentina from which he was about to be permanently self-exiled. (Cortzar moved to Paris the following year.) The setting of Final Exam is a surreal Buenos Aires, dark and eerie, where a strange fog has enveloped the city to everyone's bewilderment. Juan and Clara, two students at a college called ""The House"" (the Great Books are read aloud there by so-called Readers), meet up with their friends Andrs and Stella, as well as a journalist friend they call ""the chronicler."" Juan and Clara are getting ready to take their final exam, but instead of preparing, they wander the city with their friends, encounter strange happenings in the square, attend concerts, and discuss their lives in cafs. <p>Final Exam is a fascinating literary experiment: with stream-of-consciousness narrative techniques, radical typographical innovations, and also shifts in rhythm and direction of its characters' thoughts and speech.</p><p> Darkly funny -- and riddled with unresolved ambiguities -- Final Exam is translated ably here by Alfred MacAdam.

In transforming himself from a traditional Muslim theologian into the charismatic Iranian ruler who took on the world, Khomeini launched an Islamic revival movement that, with the collapse of communism, quickly evolved for some as the centre-piece in the pantheon of western demonology, and for others as the inspiration for spiritual and political rebirth. Whether viewed as a hero by his supporters or as a villain by his enemies, Khomeini was undoubtedly one of the seminal figures of the twentieth century, whose influence will extend some way into the new millennium. <br /><br />Baqer Moin here explores how and why this frail octogenarian, dressed in the traditional robes of a Muslim cleric, overthrew the secular Shah of Iran and became the spiritual leader of a new and militant Islamic regime. Still an enigma in the West, Khomeini transformed the Middle East and the world. But where did the man come from? What was his childhood and family background? What lay behind his implacable opposition to the Shah? What role did the turbulent events in Iran during his youth play in shaping Khomeini's political perceptions? What changed him from an obscure traditional theologian with mystical and poetic inclinations into a combative and highly vengeful radical? How will his vision of an international community of Muslims, a kind of Islamic Internationale, affect the Middle East?<br /><br />Drawing on many exclusive personal interviews with Khomeini's associates, on unpublished new materials and on the author's firsthand experience in Islamic seminaries, this biography provides a fascinating, well-documented and highly accessible analysis of the life and thought of one of the most controversial leaders of the late twentieth century.<br />",3.94,368,Hardcover, ,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216746.Khomeini,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216746.Khomeini

How did Horatio Nelson achieve such extraordinary success? Roger Knight places him firmly in the context of the Royal Navy of his time. Nelson was passionate and relentless from the outset of his career; his leadership in battle was unrivalled. But his success depended also on the strength of intelligence available to him, the quality of the ships he commanded, the potency of his guns, and the skill of his seamen.<br /><br />Based on a vast array of new sources, this biography demolishes many of the myths that have surrounded Nelson for two centuries. Knight demonstrates that this great Romantic hero was in his time a shrews political operator and often a difficult subordinate. He was occasionally naïve, often impatient, and only happy when completely in command. While capable of great acts of generosity, he could be deeply ruthless--both aboard ship and in his personal life.<br /><br />Destined to be the definitive account of Horatio Nelson's life for generations, this dazzling biography greatly enriches our understanding of this extraordinary man--brilliant, severely flawed, and never to be crossed.",4.19,873,Hardcover,1st U.S. edition,23,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216825.The_Pursuit_of_Victory,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216825.The_Pursuit_of_Victory

And the dogs act as cupids for the quiet, struggling, sometimes lonely, eccentric people, the old and the young, male and female; the people who live on the block, who are, in their ways, romantics, as all New Yorkers secretly tend to be. Walking her dog, Beatrice, Jody falls under the spell of Everett’s bewitching smile. Everett begins to appreciate his postdivorce life only when he falls in love with Howdy, Polly’s puppy. Polly lives with her brother, George, and wants him to fall in love. George isn’t so much looking for a love life as for life direction, and Howdy leads him right to it. Doris hates the trash on her block, she hates the pee on her SUV’s large tires, and, above all, she hates dogs. That is, until she gets one of her own.<br /><br />In <i>The New Yorkers</i>, as in life, canine companions compel their masters to go outside of themselves, to take part in the community they live in, to make friends, and, sometimes, to fall in love. And Schine returns to what she does best: crafting a compulsively readable, elegantly written novel that seduces in the way we were once seduced by <i>The Love Letter</i>, Schine’s beloved classic.",3.34,304,Hardcover, ,321,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217071.The_New_Yorkers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/217071.The_New_Yorkers

You could soon be one of them. On the other hand, you might not be one of them, for a number of reasons, including the odds, which are weighted heavily against you. Because while large numbers of Americans are becoming rich every day, even larger numbers of Americans are not. How does not getting rich happen? At what point in your life do you become rich or not rich? Is it fate or hard work that decides whether you go onto a life with several homes and a yacht or several credit cards and a second mortgage?""</i><br /><br />In this book, Robert Sullivan, an expert in the art of not getting rich and staying that way, shows us some simple, quick ways to cultivate a basic day-to-day attitude that will lead to not getting rich, as well as a few long-term strategies that will help you stay that way. For instance, a good well-rounded education is a must if you are planning on working your entire life and ending up with little or nothing. Choose a field of study that will be personally rewarding but has no apparent application in the real world, such as medieval literature or traditional music. And by all means choose an investment strategy that will definitely not get you rich, such as following the herd. Along the way, spend your money unwisely, read novels and books, marry for love, and waste otherwise money-making hours throwing a Frisbee in the park and playing with your kids, becoming the kind of role model that will never be featured on <i>Forbes</i>'s list of the wealthiest people in the world.

Selected by a vote of the membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), these 26 reprints represent the best, most important, and most influential stories and authors in the field. The contributors are a Who's Who of classic SF, with every Golden Age giant included: Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, John W. Campbell, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, Cordwainer Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny. Other contributors are less well known outside the core SF readership. Three of the contributors are famous for one story--but what stories!--Tom Godwin's pivotal hard-SF tale, ""The Cold Equations""; Jerome Bixby's ""It's a <i>Good</i> Life"" (made only more infamous by the chilling <i>Twilight Zone</i> adaptation); and Daniel Keyes's ""Flowers for Algernon"" (brought to mainstream fame by the movie adaptation, <i>Charly</i>).<p> The collection has some minor but frustrating flaws. There are no contributor biographies, which is bad enough when the author is a giant; but it's especially sad for contributors who have become unjustly obscure. Each story's original publication date is in small print at the bottom of the first page. And neither this fine print nor the copyright page identifies the magazines in which the stories first appeared.</p><p> Prefaced by editor Robert Silverberg's introduction, which describes SFWA and details the selection process, <i>The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964</i> is a wonderful book for the budding SF fan. Experienced SF readers should compare the table of contents to their library before making a purchase decision. Fans who contemplate giving this book to non-SF readers should bear in mind that, while several of the collected stories can measure up to classic mainstream literary stories, the less literarily-acceptable stories are weighted toward the front of the collection; adult mainstream-literature fans may not get very far into <i>The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964</i>. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i><br /><br />ix • Introduction (The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume I) • (1970) • essay by Robert Silverberg<br />13 • A Martian Odyssey • [Tweel] • (1934) • novelette by Stanley G.

THE REAL HISTORY? <br /><br />It’s a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim, defeated a mighty foe.<br /><br />Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn’t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn’t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people—and to the pushcarts.<br /><br />The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world.

Operating in Chicago’s notorious Levee district at the dawn of the last century, the Club’s proprietors, two aristocratic sisters named Minna and Ada Everleigh, welcomed moguls and actors, senators and athletes, foreign dignitaries and literary icons, into their stately double mansion, where thirty stunning Everleigh “butterflies” awaited their arrival. Courtesans named Doll, Suzy Poon Tang, and Brick Top devoured raw meat to the delight of Prince Henry of Prussia and recited poetry for Theodore Dreiser. Whereas lesser madams pocketed most of a harlot’s earnings and kept a “whipper” on staff to mete out discipline, the Everleighs made sure their girls dined on gourmet food, were examined by an honest physician, and even tutored in the literature of Balzac.<br /><br />Not everyone appreciated the sisters’ attempts to elevate the industry. Rival Levee madams hatched numerous schemes to ruin the Everleighs, including an attempt to frame them for the death of department store heir Marshall Field, Jr. But the sisters’ most daunting foes were the Progressive Era reformers, who sent the entire country into a frenzy with lurid tales of “white slavery-the allegedly rampant practice of kidnapping young girls and forcing them into brothels. This furor shaped America’s sexual culture and had repercussions all the way to the White House, including the formation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br /><br />With a cast of characters that includes Jack Johnson, John Barrymore, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., William Howard Taft, “Hinky Dink” Kenna, and Al Capone, Sin in the Second City is Karen Abbott’s colorful, nuanced portrait of the iconic Everleigh sisters, their world-famous Club, and the perennial clash between our nation’s hedonistic impulses and Puritanical roots.

Fresh from victory in Gaul, Julius Caesar leads battle-hardened legions across the Rubicon river–threatening Rome herself. Even the master strategist Pompey is caught unprepared by the strike, and forced to abandon his city. The armies of Rome will face each other at last in civil war, led by the two greatest generals ever to walk the seven hills. Thus begins Conn Iggulden’s towering saga of Julius Caesar as he approaches his final destiny—a destiny that will be decided not by legions but by his friend Brutus and an Egyptian queen named Cleopatra, who will bear his only son....<br /><br />For Caesar, the campaign against Pompey will test his military genius and his appetite for glory to their limits, as the greatest fighting machine the world has ever seen divides against itself in a bloody conflict that will set brother against brother until victory or death. But for Caesar, another kingdom beckons—a world of ancient mysteries and languid sensuality, where a beautiful, bewitching woman waits to snare his heart. <br /><br /><b>The Gods of War</b> follows Julius Caesar through politics and passion, ruthless ambition and private grief, and into the corruption of power itself. Those he has loved will play a part in his triumphs—as will the jealousy and hatred of his enemies.<br /><br />From the spectacles of the arena to the whispered lies of conspirators, Conn Iggulden brings to life a world of monumental drama. And at its heart is one extraordinary friendship—marked by fierce loyalty and bitter betrayal, with dark events shrouded in noble ideals.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.31,496,Paperback, ,200,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221298.The_Gods_of_War,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221298.The_Gods_of_War

Materialism, pressure to achieve, perfectionism, and disconnection are combining to create a perfect storm that is devastating children of privilege and their parents alike.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this eye-opening, provocative, and essential book, clinical psychologist Madeline Levine explodes one child-rearing myth after another. With empathy and candor, she identifies toxic cultural influences and well-intentioned, but misguided, parenting practices that are detrimental to a child's healthy self-development.

There was a time when luxury was available only to the rarefied and aristocratic world of old money and royalty. Luxury wasn't simply a product, it was a lifestyle, one that denoted a history of tradition, superior quality and offered a pampered buying experience. Today's luxury marketplace would be virtually unrecognizable to its founders. Gone are the family-owned businesses dedicated to integrity and quality; the industry is now run by multi-billion dollar global corporations focused on growth, visibility, brand-awareness, advertising and above all, profits. Handcrafted goods are practically extinct, and almost all manufacturing has been outsourced to large factories in such places as China, where your expensive brand-name handbag is being assembled right next to one from a mass-market label that will cost substantially less. Dana Thomas, a journalist who has covered style and the luxury business for The Washington Post, Newsweek and The New York Times Magazine from Paris for the past fifteen years, digs deep into the dark side of the luxury industry to uncover all the secrets that Prada, Gucci and Burberry don't want us to know. Traveling from the laboratories in Grasse, where the ingredients for Christian Dior and Prada perfumes are produced, to the crowded factories in China, where workers glue together ""Made in Italy"" bags by the thousands, Thomas explores the whole of today's high-end shopping experience to answer some pressing questions: What is the new definition of luxury when advertising for this lifestyle is targeted mainly toward the mass market? What are we paying for when quality has given way to quantity? Can integrity survive in a corporate culture driven to meet regular growth and profit projections? Is luxury still the best that money can buy?",3.88,384,Hardcover, ,298,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222328.Deluxe,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222328.Deluxe

W. Norton  Company,eng,false,"<strong>One of the most dramatic stories of genetic discovery since James Watson's <em>The Double Helix</em>—a work whose scientific and cultural reverberations will be discussed for years to come.</strong><br /><br />In 1994 Professor Bryan Sykes, a leading world authority on DNA and human evolution, was called in to examine the frozen remains of a man trapped in glacial ice in northern Italy. News of both the Ice Man's discovery and his age, which was put at over five thousand years, fascinated scientists and newspapers throughout the world. But what made Sykes's story particularly revelatory was his successful identification of a genetic descendant of the Ice Man, a woman living in Great Britain today. How was Sykes able to locate a living relative of a man who died thousands of years ago?<br /><br />In <em>The Seven Daughters of Eve</em>, he gives us a firsthand account of his research into a remarkable gene, which passes undiluted from generation to generation through the maternal line. After plotting thousands of DNA sequences from all over the world, Sykes found that they clustered around a handful of distinct groups. Among Europeans and North American Caucasians, there are, in fact, only seven. This conclusion was staggering: almost everyone of native European descent, wherever they may live throughout the world, can trace their ancestry back to one of seven women, the Seven Daughters of Eve.<br /><br />Naming them Ursula, Xenia, Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine, and Jasmine, Sykes has created portraits of their disparate worlds by mapping the migratory patterns followed by millions of their ancestors. In reading the stories of these seven women, we learn exactly how our origins can be traced, how and where our ancient genetic ancestors lived, and how we are each living proof of the almost indestructible strands of DNA, which have survived over so many thousands of years. Indeed, <em>The Seven Daughters of Eve</em> is filled with dramatic stories: from Sykes's identification, using DNA samples from two living relatives, of the remains of Tsar Nicholas and Tsaress Alexandra, to the Caribbean woman whose family had been sold into slavery centuries before and whose ancestry Sykes was able to trace back to the Eastern coast of central Africa. Ultimately, Sykes's investigation reveals that, as a race, what humans have in common is more deeply embedded than what separates us.<br />",3.99,320,Hardcover, ,507,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222637.The_Seven_Daughters_of_Eve,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222637.The_Seven_Daughters_of_Eve

Se han visto en sueños, se han buscado desde hace tiempo y, en el momento en que se encuentran, los tres pierden la vida. Trescientos años después, en 1982, en Estambul se reúnen tres científicos: un egipcio, un yugoslavo y una hebrea polaca. Los tres, como antes hicieran sus predecesores, se ocupan de los jázaros, y juntos reúnen los fragmentos de un diccionario jázaro. En el instante que precede a la aclaración última, dos de los científicos mueren.<br /><br />Los jázaros: Pueblo turco que, entre los siglos VII y X, se establece en la ribera del mar Caspio, y del cual apenas nos han llegado noticias. Se convirtieron a una de las tres grandes religiones: según los cristianos, al cristianismo; según los musulmanes, al islam; según los hebreos, al judaísmo. A su aparición en 1984, se escribió que, después de El nombre de la rosa y El perfume, Diccionario jázaro era la novela que había despertado más expectación internacional en años.

What teenage girls make of these contradictory messages, and what they make of their awakening sexuality--so distant from and yet so susceptible to cultural stereotypes--emerges for the first time in frank and complex fashion in Deborah Tolman's <i>Dilemmas of Desire</i>.<br /><br />A unique look into the world of adolescent sexuality, this book offers an intimate and often disturbing, sometimes inspiring, picture of how teenage girls experience, understand, and respond to their sexual feelings, and of how society mediates, shapes, and distorts this experience. In extensive interviews, we listen as actual adolescent girls--both urban and suburban--speak candidly of their curiosity and confusion, their pleasure and disappointment, their fears, defiance, or capitulation in the face of a seemingly imperishable double standard that smiles upon burgeoning sexuality in boys yet frowns, even panics, at its equivalent in girls.<br /><br />As a vivid evocation of girls negotiating some of the most vexing issues of adolescence, and as a thoughtful, richly informed examination of the dilemmas these girls face, this readable and revealing book begins the critical work of understanding the sexuality of young women in all its personal, social, and emotional significance.",3.87,259,Paperback, ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225044.Dilemmas_of_Desire,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225044.Dilemmas_of_Desire

We're rebelling against technology that's too complicated, DVD players with too many menus, and software accompanied by 75-megabyte ""read me"" manuals. The iPod's clean gadgetry has made simplicity hip. But sometimes we find ourselves caught up in the simplicity paradox: we want something that's simple and easy to use, but also does all the complex things we might ever want it to do. In <em>The Laws of Simplicity</em>, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design—guidelines for needing less and actually getting more.<br /><br />Maeda—a professor in MIT's Media Lab and a world-renowned graphic designer—explores the question of how we can redefine the notion of ""improved"" so that it doesn't always mean something more, something added on.<br /><br />Maeda's first law of simplicity is ""Reduce."" It's not necessarily beneficial to add technology features just because we can. And the features that we do have must be organized (Law 2) in a sensible hierarchy so users aren't distracted by features and functions they don't need. But simplicity is not less just for the sake of less. Skip ahead to Law 9: ""Failure: Accept the fact that some things can never be made simple."" Maeda's concise guide to simplicity in the digital age shows us how this idea can be a cornerstone of organizations and their products—how it can drive both business and technology. We can learn to simplify without sacrificing comfort and meaning, and we can achieve the balance described in Law 10. This law, which Maeda calls ""The One,"" tells us: ""Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.""",3.93,100,Hardcover, ,264,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225111.The_Laws_of_Simplicity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225111.The_Laws_of_Simplicity

Further, until U.S. leaders recognize the errant path they have irresponsibly chosen, he says, our enemies will only grow stronger.<br /><br /> According to the author Michael Scheuer, the greatest danger for Americans confronting the Islamist threat is to believe—at the urging of U.S. leaders—that Muslims attack us for what we are and what we think rather than for what we do. Blustering political rhetoric “informs” the public that the Islamists are offended by the Western world’s democratic freedoms, civil liberties, inter-mingling of genders, and separation of church and state. However, although aspects of the modern world may offend conservative Muslims, no Islamist leader has fomented jihad to destroy participatory democracy, for example, the national association of credit unions, or coed universities. Instead, a growing segment of the Islamic world strenuously disapproves of specific U.S. policies and their attendant military, political, and economic implications.<br /><br /> Capitalizing on growing anti-U.S. animosity, Osama bin Laden’s genius lies not simply in calling for jihad, but in articulating a consistent and convincing case that Islam is under attack by America. Al Qaeda’s public statements condemn America’s protection of corrupt Muslim regimes, unqualified support for Israel, the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, and a further litany of real-world grievances. Bin Laden’s supporters thus identify their problem and believe their solution lies in war. Scheuer contends they will go to any length, not to destroy our secular, democratic way of life, but to deter what they view as specific attacks on their lands, their communities, and their religion. Unless U.S. leaders recognize this fact and adjust their policies abroad accordingly, even moderate Muslims will join the bin Laden camp.<br /><br />  ",3.80,352,Paperback, ,69,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225746.Imperial_Hubris,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/225746.Imperial_Hubris

But the best character Katharine Hepburn ever created was Katharine Hepburn: a Connecticut Yankee, outspoken and elegant, she wore pants whatever the occasion and bristled at Hollywood glitter. So captivating was her image that she never seemed less than authentic. But how well did we know her, really? Was there a woman behind the image who was more human, more driven, and ultimately more triumphant because of her vulnerability? <br />William J. Mann--a cultural historian and journalist, a sympathetic admirer but no mere fan--has fashioned an intimate, often revisionist, and truly unique close-up that challenges much of what we think we know about the Great Kate. Previous biographies--mostly products of friends and fans--have recycled the stories she hid behind, taking Hollywood myths at face value. Mann goes deeper, delivering new details from friends and family who have not been previously interviewed and drawing on materials only available since Hepburn's death. <br />With affection, intelligence, and a voluminous knowledge of Hollywood history, Mann shows us how a woman originally considered too special and controversial for fame learned the fine arts of movie stardom and transformed herself into an icon as durable and all-American as the Statue of Liberty.",3.93,621,Hardcover, ,73,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226139.Kate,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226139.Kate

But Hansen’s behind-the-scenes access soon gets her much more than she bargained for: working twenty-four hours a day, juggling the shifting demands of the Hollywood elite, and struggling to comprehend wealth unimaginable to most Americans, not to mention dealing with the expected tantrums and the unexpected tense–and intense–atmosphere in the house where she lives with her employers.<br /><br />When the thankless drudgery takes its toll and Hansen finally quits, her boss threatens to blackball her from ever nannying in Hollywood again. Discouraged but determined, Hansen manages to land gigs with Debra Winger and then Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman. Attentive, welcoming parents with a relaxed attitude toward celebrity–looks like Hansen’s fallen into a real-life happy ending. But the round-the-clock workdays continue, rubbing some of the glitter off L.A. living, and Hansen’s not sure how much longer she can pretend to be Mary Poppins. Even bosses who treat her like family can’t help as she struggles to find meaning in her work while living in a town that seems to lack respect for nannies and everyone else who comes in the employee’s entrance–but without whom many showbiz households would grind to a halt.<br /><br />Peppering her own journey with true stories and high drama experienced by other nannies to the stars, Hansen offers an intriguing, entertaining mix of tales from the cribs of the rich and famous. <i>You’ll Never Nanny in This Town Again</i> is a treat for everyone who is fascinated by the skewed priorities of Tinseltown, for anyone who has wondered how high-wattage supermoms do it all, and for readers who love peeking behind the curtains of celebrity, all of whom will devour this unparalleled–and unabashedly true–account of one girl’s tour of duty as Hollywood’s hired help.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.40,304,Paperback, ,213,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227467.You_ll_Never_Nanny_in_This_Town_Again,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227467.You_ll_Never_Nanny_in_This_Town_Again

Why was she carrying the name of the man who found her body? Who among the many acquaintances in her complicated and tragic life could have wanted her dead? And could her murder have some connection to a twenty-eight-year-old musical wunderkind, a virtuoso violinist who several months earlier suddenly and inexplicably lost the ability to play a single note? <br />For Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley, whose own domestic life is about to change radically, these questions are only the first in an investigation that leads him to walk a fine line between personal loyalty and professional honor. <br />Assigned to the case by his superior, Superintendent Malcolm Webberly, Lynley learns that Webberly's first murder investigation as a DI over twenty years ago involved Eugenie Davies and a sensational criminal trial. Yet what is truly damaging is what Webberly already knows and no doubt wants Lynley to keep concealed. <br />Now the pressure is on Lynley to find Eugenie Davies' killer. For not only is he putting his own career into jeopardy, but he is also attempting to safeguard the careers of his longtime partners Barbara Havers and Winston Nkata.

Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. Routine, order and predictability shelter him from the messy, wider world. Then, at fifteen, Christopher’s carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbor’s dog, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the killing. <br /><br />Christopher decides that he will track down the real killer and turns to his favorite fictional character, the impeccably logical Sherlock Holmes, for inspiration.

These are the confessions, years afterward, of a young man who found at a small Vermont college the life of privilege and intellect he'd long coveted - and rarely has the glorious experience of youth infatuated with knowledge and with itself been so achingly realized. Then, amazed, Richard Papen is drawn into the ultimate inner circle: five students, worldly and self-assured, selected by a charismatic classics professor to participate in the search for truth and beauty. Together they study the mysteries of ancient Greek culture and spend long weekends at an old country house, reading, boating, basking in an Indian summer that stretches late into autumn. Mesmerized by his new comrades, Richard is unaware of the crime which they have committed in his dreamy, unwitting presence. But once taken into their confidence, he and the others slowly and inevitably begin to believe in the necessity of murdering the one classmate and friend who might betray both their secret and their future. Hugely ambitious and compulsively readable, this is a chronicle of deception and complicity, of Dionysian abandon, of innocence corrupted by self-love and moral arrogance; and, finally, it is a story of guilt and responsibility.

Armani! Versace!</i> at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym.

She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing.

He took us through the briars of political and social policy debate, entertained us with the best of Canadian music and song, challenged us with the mysteries of science, tipped us to the better books of the season and introduced us to their authors, gave us tested and mouthwatering recipes, read aloud our best letters to him, and took us off the beaten path of Canada to show us who and where we are.<br /><br />The program lives on in <i>The Morningside Years</i>. In these pages – and on the accompanying free compact disk – you’ll find a collection of the most memorable items from the program’s years on air. Here you’ll rediscover Gzowski’s interviews with the stars of Canadian literature – Margaret Laurence, Robertson Davies, W. O. Mitchell, Alice Munro, Timothy Findley, and Margaret Atwood. The heartbreaking drama by Emil Sher, <i>Mourning Dove</i>, is presented in its entirety, as is the exceptional panel discussion of Louis Riel’s trial. There’s a chapter of the fifteen best letters to the program, as well as a mini-<i>Morningside Papers</i> – “The Sixth (and Definitely Last).”<br /><br />There are photographs, too: a <i>Morningside</i> family album and a series of candid shots taken in the studio during what may have been the most exciting day in the program’s life – the day spent preparing for the 1997 Red River Rally. There are conversations with scientists, and letters from abroad and from the North. And, on the accompanying CD, among other memorable pieces, there are excerpts from a classic political conversation among Eric Kierans, Stephen Lewis, and Dalton Camp, a hilarious conversation with Stuart McLean, a moment with Margaret Visser, a new arrangement of “O Canada,” sung a cappella by Quartette, and an unforgettable discussion among all the Canadian women who ever swam Lake Ontario.<br /><br />Dalton Camp, one of the most companionable fixtures of <i>Morningside</i>, contributes a funny and surprisingly tender foreword, but Gzowski has the final word in the book: an essay in which he reflects on what <i>Morningside</i> was and what it meant to him. <br /><br />His retirement as host of <i>Morningside</i> in May 1997 occasioned a flood of affection for the man and accolades for his journalism that was unprecedented in Canadian broadcasting. Many lamented not just the passing of <i>Morningside</i>, but also the loss of a daily presence who, with the tools of unfeigned curiosity and simple courtesy, tended a vast field in which Canada’s tallest poppies thrived.<br /><br />A priceless keepsake, <i>The Morningside Years</i> is Peter Gzowski’s salute to his listeners and an enduring memento of Canadian broadcasting at its best.",3.85,344,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/229468.The_Morningside_Years,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/229468.The_Morningside_Years

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides. <br /> <br />Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives ""lickings"" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a ""tattle-tale."" <br /> <br />As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get ""engaged"" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been ""engaged"" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br />""TOM!"" <br />No answer. <br />""TOM!"" <br />No answer. <br />""What's gone with that boy,  I wonder?

She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: <br />""Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—"" <br />She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat. <br />""I never did see the beat of that boy!""",3.91,164,Hardcover, ,18,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230346._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230346._

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. <br /><br />The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. <br /><br />That's how your brain knows.<br /><br />And that's how your brain will learn Java. <i>Head First Java</i> combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. <br /><br />If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.<br /><br />By exploiting how your brain works, <i>Head First Java</i> compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.",4.23,688,Paperback, 2nd Edition,203,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231262.Head_First_Java,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231262.Head_First_Java

Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching, funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back to city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger. No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and befriending raccoons. <p> Jean Craighead George, author of more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning <i>Julie of the Wolves</i>, created another prizewinner with <i>My Side of the Mountain</i>--a Newbery Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly, she wrote its sequel, <i>On the Far Side of the Mountain</i>, 30 years later, and a decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, <i>Frightful's Mountain</i>, told from the falcon's point of view.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for ""social"") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.<br /><br /><i>Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

Is a serial butcher loose in Virginia? That's what the panicked public thinks, thanks to a local TV reporter who got the leaked news from her boyfriend, Scarpetta's vile rival, Investigator Percy Ring. But the butchered bodies are so many red herrings intended to throw idiots like Ring off the track. Instead of a run-of-the-mill serial killer, we're dealing with a shadowy figure who has plans involving mutant smallpox, mass murder, and messing with Scarpetta's mind by e-mailing her gory photos of the murder scenes, along with cryptic AOL chat-room messages. The coolest innovation: Scarpetta's gorgeous genius niece, Lucy, equips her with a DataGlove and a VPL Eyephone, and she takes a creepy virtual tour of the e-mailed crime scene.<br /><br /><i>Unnatural Exposure</i> boasts brisk storytelling, crackling dialogue, evocative prose about forensic-science sleuthing, and crisp character sketches, both of familiar characters like Scarpetta's gruff partner Pete Marino and bit players like the landfill employee falsely accused by Ring. Plus, let's face it: serial killers are old hat. Cornwell's most vivid villains are highly plausible backstabbing colleagues like Ring, who plots to destroy Lucy's FBI career by outing her as a lesbian. Some readers object to the rather abrupt ending, but, hey, it's less jarring than <i>Hannibal</i>'s, and it's the logical culmination of Cornwell's philosophy about human nature. To illuminate the novel's finale, read Cornwell's remarks on paranoia in her Amazon.com interview. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>",4.07,370,Paperback, ,494,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232145.Unnatural_Exposure,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/232145.Unnatural_Exposure

This amazing clan -- and their friends -- is a bold, powerful group of men who let nothing stand in their way when it comes to matters of the heart. And in this, Stephanie Laurens's newest novel, a passionate man and a daring woman confront the ultimate question. . . .<br /><br />What Price Love?<br /><br />There is nothing more fascinating than a darkly handsome rake, especially one as controlled and elusive as Dillon Caxton, protégé of Demon Cynster. Despite his dangerous air, Dillon is a man of sterling reputation, but it wasn't always so. Years ago, an illicit scheme turned into a nefarious swindle, and only the help of his cousin, Felicity, and her husband, Demon, saved Dillon from ruin. Now impeccably honest, he guards his hard-won reputation and is the Keeper of the Register of all racing horses in England. His standing and aloofness make Dillon undeniably desirable to young ladies, but despite all the lures thrown his way, he remains uninterested -- his attention unfixed.<br /><br />Until ""Miss Priscilla Dalling"" erupts into his life. A stunning beauty, she affects Dillon as no other ever has, but what fascinates him even more is that this tempting young lady is clearly desperate, and equally clearly lying about wanting to see the Register to fulfill the whim of an eccentric aunt.<br /><br />Lady Priscilla Dalloway will do <em>anything</em> to see what's in the Register -- even lie! Her twin brother, Russell, who had fought with their father and left the family home to work with the finest racehorses, has disappeared. Pris knows that clues to his whereabouts can be found in the tome Dillon Caxton refuses to let her see.<br /><br />She unleashes her feminine wiles on Dillon -- to no avail. But Dillon is now determined to learn the truth behind her quest. Exploiting the powerful attraction that flares between them, he succeeds in convincing Pris to tell him all, to trust him with her twin's life. Together, Dillon and Pris locate Rus, only to discover that his life is being threatened by the perpetrators of a massive betting swindle.<br /><br />The time is ripe for Dillon to repay old debts by helping another as he himself was helped. Assisted by Demon, Felicity, and Barnaby Adair, Dillon and Pris embark on a journey riddled with danger -- and undeniable passion -- as they seek to overturn the swindle and expose Rus's deadly enemies.

The wardens have given the boy a light workload because he shows talent as a runner. But if he wins the national long-distance running competition as everyone is counting on him to do, Smith will only vindicate the very system and society that has locked him up.<i> “</i>The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner” has long been considered a masterpiece on both the page and the silver screen. Adapted for film by Sillitoe himself in 1962, it became an instant classic of British New Wave cinema.<br />  <br />  In “Uncle Ernest,” a middle-aged furniture upholsterer traumatized in World War II, now leads a lonely life. His wife has left him, his brothers have moved away, and the townsfolk treat him as if he were a ghost. When the old man finally finds companionship with two young girls whom he enjoys buying pastries for at a café, the local authorities find his behavior morally suspect. “Mr. Raynor the School Teacher” delves into a different kind of isolation—that of a voyeuristic teacher who fantasizes constantly about the women who work in a draper’s shop across the street. When his students distract him from his lustful daydreams, Mr. Raynor becomes violent.<br />  <br /> The six stories that follow in this iconic collection continue to cement Alan Sillitoe’s reputation as one of Britain’s foremost storytellers, and a champion of the condemned, the oppressed, and the overlooked.<br />  <br /> This ebook features an illustrated biography of Alan Sillitoe including rare images from the author’s estate.<br /><br />  </div>",3.80,176,Paperback,Re-issue edition,247,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233436.The_Loneliness_of_the_Long_Distance_Runner,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233436.The_Loneliness_of_the_Long_Distance_Runner

Coltivare in semplicità una visione di pace. Quali sono i fili che intessono il reale? Il bianco e il nero, il diurno e il notturno, il fervido sole e la fresca luna, il cielo e la terra (figlia o madre della luna), la vita e la morte, lo zolfo e il mercurio: tutte queste diadi eccole nel rapporto tra la lunghezza della corda vibrante e l’altezza del suono emesso, che stanno in ragione inversa l’una dell’altra. Che cosa è la somma Sapienza? Non qualcosa che si possa accostare impunemente: essa fa misurare l’altezza imperscrutabile dei cieli e la profondità misteriosa degli abissi, schiude una vista cui non regge il cuore di carne. È una conoscenza che può volgersi al serafico o al luciferico. Quando in occasione della ristampa di <i>Le meraviglie della natura</i> (1991) Elémire Zolla aggiunse il capitolo <i>Pensieri alchemici fra 1975 e 1990</i>, la materia trattata - scrive nell’introduzione Grazia Marchianò - s’incurvò come un arcobaleno a lambire le soglie del terzo millennio. Negli esperimenti sulla fusione fredda di Fleischmann e Pons che nei primi anni novanta la comunità scientifica internazionale aveva accolto per lo più con dileggio e alterigia, Zolla scorgeva ‘stranezze’ caratteristiche di certi processi alchemici, ad esempio che la fusione avviene a volte sì a volte no e quasi sempre in primavera. Una ragione di più per tuffarsi nei segreti della natura con la disposizione a ""guardarsi d’attorno con esultanza"". Infatti solo ""a questo patto - si legge nel primo capitolo - sollevando una gleba odorosa, spiccando un frutto, contemplando le iridescenze di gioielli o di cascate, lo splendore d’un incarnato umano o d’una liscia pelliccia o d’una folgorante colata di metalli, forse si saprà sentire la presenza animatrice che ha plasmato e va plasmando queste materie…"".<br /><br />La riedizione di <i>Le meraviglie della natura. Introduzione all’alchimia</i> (Marsilio 1991) rientra nel recupero completo dell’opera sistematica, occasionale e narrativa di Elémire Zolla (1926-2002) di cui Marsilio ha pubblicato <i>Aure. I luoghi, i riti</i> (rist. 2003), <i>L’amante invisibile. L’erotica sciamanica nelle religioni, nella letteratura, nella legittimazione politica</i>, Premio Ascoli Piceno 1987 (rist. 2003); <i>Archetipi</i> (tr. dall’inglese <i>Archetypes</i>, Londra 1981 e Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York 1981; tr. giapponese e spagnola); <i>Verità segrete esposte in evidenza</i> (rist. 2003), <i>I letterati e lo sciamano. L’Indiano nella letteratura americana dalle origini al 1988</i> (tr. inglese, francese e spagnola). Altre opere maggiori di Zolla negli ultimi vent’anni sono apparse presso Adelphi, Mondadori, Einaudi e Alberto Tallone (Alpignano). Il romanzo giovanile <i>Minuetto all’inferno</i> (Premio Strega opera prima 1956), introduzione di G.

Le Goff demuestra a la perfección cómo ese ideal permitió la construcción de la Edad Media, una época de la que surgió la nuestra, aunque no sin desgarros.<br /><br />Esos hombres, esas mujeres, pensaban que el mundo se hallaba cerca del ocaso; la humanidad, cansada, en declive. Sin embargo, no dejaron de inventar, de mejorar, de perfeccionar. Esos hombres, esas mujeres, imaginaban un universo cerrado, unos valores sólidamente encarnados en los lugares y los objetos. No obstante, peregrinaban hacia otro mundo, esperando otro espacio, deseando otro tiempo. Crearon cosas nuevas, aunque el principio mismo de ""novedad"" les pareciera detestable. Y uno puede preguntarse si nuestra pretensión de ser siempre más ""modernos"" no es, al contrario, indicio de inmovilismo y pesadez. Así, proyectamos en la Edad Media nuestras sombras, sin ver sus luces.<br /><br />Revisar la civilización medieval con Jacques Le Goff supone descubrir el dinamismo y el optimismo razonado propios de nuestros predecesores, pero sin que ello implique idealizarlos.
