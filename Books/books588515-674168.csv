Divided into three sections, the book begins with how-to-get-your-man manuals and ends with the newlywed year. First there’s “Courtship and the Marriage Quest.” Geller looks at the absurd nature of proposals, the inane practice of engagement and gift-giving, and the bizarre rules governing the wedding dress. In part two, “The Big Day,” she deals with the specifics of the wedding itself. There are place cards and table settings, rigid photo ops, vows, toasts, garter belts, and daddy dances. What do these highly scripted procedures say about this most treasured ritual? Finally, the author explores some of marriage’s deeper implications in “Living in the Plural”: the strangely isolating honeymoon and the establishment of marital identity that begins with a simple thank-you note.",3.65,428,Paperback, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/588515.Here_Comes_the_Bride,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/588515.Here_Comes_the_Bride

Upon joining the training camp of superlightweight Billy Costello, Thomas Hauser was given unprecedented access to the fighter, his manager, and trainer as well as to the real heavyweights of the boxing world, promoter Don King, and World Boxing Council president Jose Sulaiman. The result, according to Playboy in their review of the original, is a book that ""explains why fighters fight, what they go through to win, and how they feel when they lose. It is a great book."" In this gracefully written, fast-paced narrative, the author slips quietly into the background and gives us a firsthand look at a business that is often cruel and exploitative and a sport that is at once violent and beautiful. As the San Francisco Chronicle points out, The Black Lights provides ammunition for both sides in the debate over boxing: ""Hauser has written what is clearly the most complete and fairminded work on the subject to date.""

Here he relates his adventures during a lifetime of traveling the world to observe and record nature. Peterson's sense of adventure and curiousity could not be extinguished. While in his eighties, as one essay relates, his boat capsized in freezing water off the coast of Maine as he was filming a documentary. In another essay we watch his tiny rowboat get caught in an angry sea off the coast of Argentina. Then there is what Peterson called his most exciting bird experience: searching for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. <br />Though Peterson was widely known for his illustrations, this collection reminds us of his accomplishments as a phtographer, for Peterson was nearly as passionate about photography as he was about painting.

The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling coauthor of <i>Survivor: The Ultimate Game</i> investigates in this thrilling account.</b><br /><br />With the utterance of a single line--""Doctor Livingstone, I presume?""--a remote meeting in the heart of Africa was transformed into one of the most famous encounters in exploration history. But the true story behind Dr. David Livingstone and journalist Henry Morton Stanley is one that has escaped telling. <i>Into Africa </i>is an extraordinarily researched account of a thrilling adventure--defined by alarming foolishness, intense courage, and raw human achievement.<br /><br />In the mid-1860s, exploration had reached a plateau. The seas and continents had been mapped, the globe circumnavigated. Yet one vexing puzzle remained unsolved: what was the source of the mighty Nile river? Aiming to settle the mystery once and for all, Great Britain called upon its legendary explorer, Dr. David Livingstone, who had spent years in Africa as a missionary. In March 1866, Livingstone steered a massive expedition into the heart of Africa. In his path lay nearly impenetrable, uncharted terrain, hostile cannibals, and deadly predators. Within weeks, the explorer had vanished without a trace. Years passed with no word.<br /><br />While debate raged in England over whether Livingstone could be found--or rescued--from a place as daunting as Africa, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., the brash American newspaper tycoon, hatched a plan to capitalize on the world's fascination with the missing legend. He would send a young journalist, Henry Morton Stanley, into Africa to search for Livingstone. A drifter with great ambition, but little success to show for it, Stanley undertook his assignment with gusto, filing reports that would one day captivate readers and dominate the front page of the <i>New York Herald</i>.<br /><br />Tracing the amazing journeys of Livingstone and Stanley in alternating chapters, author Martin Dugard captures with breathtaking immediacy the perils and challenges these men faced. Woven into the narrative, Dugard tells an equally compelling story of the remarkable transformation that occurred over the course of nine years, as Stanley rose in power and prominence and Livingstone found himself alone and in mortal danger. The first book to draw on modern research and to explore the combination of adventure, politics, and larger-than-life personalities involved, <i>Into Africa</i> is a riveting read.",4.09,340,Paperback, ,369,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/595069.Into_Africa,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/595069.Into_Africa

A sudden, intense, and even feverish ex change of letters followed, a correspondence which inevitably brought together the poet and the woman hitherto unknown to him. Rilke was going on forty. Separated from his wife, he was physically ill and mentally depressed, fearing the loss of his creative power, alternately dreading and desiring a self-determined isolation. She was many years younger, a concert pianist of no small repute. She, too, was alone her early marriage had ended in a divorce, and she was seeking for something, or someone, mortal yet beyond the flesh. In Rilke she found not a man but an apparition, a super-earthly LETTERS TO BENVENUTA saint, a visionary Fra Angelico at their first meet ing she thought He has come by a miracle to our poor earth and me 5 The woman, Magda von Hattingberg, told the story of that strange attachment and the short but dramatic association in Rilke and Benvenuta W. W. Norton and Company, Inc., 1949 , a revealing volume which she subtitled A Book of Thanks. The quasi-narrative of that book is amplified and enriched in Letters to Benvenuta, a series of letters written by Rilke during his second sojourn in Paris. Rilke had traveled restlessly from Prague, where he was born, through the military schools of Moravia to Germany Russia, where he met Tolstoy and attended the Pushkin festivals Denmark, because of his great admiration for the Danish novelist, Jens Peter Jacobsen France, where he lived with Rodin. Then, after the break with Rodin and during Rilkes dry period, he journeyed to Tunis, Algiers, Biskra, the Nile, which affected him deeply Cairo, where he had a three weeks serious attack of sickness north to Venice, to be watched over by the Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis-Hohenlohe, who installed him in the ancient castle at Duino near Trieste on the LETTERS TO BENVENUTA Adriatic then Spain, where his illness overcame him again then, in 1913, back to Paris. It was in Paris that there began the extraordinary correspondence which is disclosed in this book. To be more exact, only half of it is here Magda von Hattingberg, rechristened Benvenuta by Rilke, has withheld the letters which prompted the poets introspective and far-reaching replies but the por tion reprinted is of inestimable value as a supple ment to what we know about the author of the im mensely popular The Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke and the profoundly moving Duino Elegies. Here, as in the poetry, Rilke writes not only on two levels statement and suggestion, observation magnified by imagination but on many levels of consciousness swiftly and simulta neously. Sometimes the writing is placid and even happy sometimes it is full of tortured apprehension the letters were composed daily, often several a day they floated serenely from his musing mind or hurtled out of the depths of his troubled spirit.

Cohen-Solal muestra al autor y a su pensamiento: sensibilidad particular a las guerras, pasión por la modernidad, odio hacia lo arcaico, máquina de subversión contra el poder, contra cualquier tipo de poder; vuelve sobre periodos clave de la trayectoria sartreana como el de la ocupación; arroja nueva luz sobre algunos temas espinosos como las relaciones con el PCF (Partido Comunista Francés) o la polémica con Camus y se pregunta por la divergencia en la recepción de la obra de Sartre en Francia y en el extranjero. Se trata de un homenaje original a quien rechazó todos los honores (desde la Legión de Honor al Premio Nobel) y que abre nuevos caminos para una lectura renovada de su obra. ¿Qué es, pues, la obra de Sartre en 2005?

The risque contents of the breakthrough novel by hip new author Wei Hui have so alarmed Beijing authorities that thousands of copies have been confiscated and burned. As explicit as Henry Miller's <i>Tropic of Cancer,</i> as shocking as <i>Trainspotting,</i> this story of a beautiful writer and her erotically charged affairs jumps, howls, and hits the ground running as it depicts the new generation rising in the East. <br /> Set in the centuries-old port city of Shanghai, the novel follows the days, and nights, of the irrepressibly carnal Coco, who waits tables in a café when she meets her first lover, a sensitive Chinese artist. Defying her parents, Coco moves in with her boyfriend and enters a frenzied, orgasmic world of drugs and hedonism. But, helpless to stop her gentle lover's descent into addiction, Coco becomes attracted to a boisterous Westerner, a rich German businessman with a penchant for S/M and seduction. Now, with an entourage of friends ranging from a streetwise madame to a rebellious filmmaker, Coco's forays into in the territory of love and lust cross the borders between two cultures -- awakening her guilt and fears of discovery, yet stimulating her emerging sexual self. Searing a blistering image into the reader's imagination, <i>Shanghai Baby</i> provides an alternative travelogue into the back streets of a city and the hard-core escapades of today's liberated youth. Wei Hui's provocative portrayal of men, women, and cultural transition is an astonishing and brave exposure of the unacknowledged new China, breaking through official rhetoric to show the inroads of the West and a people determined to burst free.",3.21,272,Paperback, ,25,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/600526.Shanghai_Baby,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/600526.Shanghai_Baby

She exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this “feminine” weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire.<br /><br />In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activist must work to embrace and empower femininity—in all of its wondrous forms.",4.23,390,Paperback, ,433,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/605663.Whipping_Girl,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/605663.Whipping_Girl

Very few such efforts pay serious attention to the role of religion and spirituality in the lives of American adolescents. But many teenagers are very involved in religion. Surveys reveal that 35% attend religious services weekly and another 15% attend at least monthly. 60% say that religious faith is important in their lives. 40% report that they pray daily. 25% say that they have been ""born again."" Teenagers feel good about the congregations they belong to. Some say that faith provides them with guidance and resources for knowing how to live well. What is going on in the religious and spiritual lives of American teenagers? What do they actually believe? What religious practices do they engage in? Do they expect to remain loyal to the faith of their parents? Or are they abandoning traditional religious institutions in search of a new, more authentic ""spirituality""? This book attempts to answer these and related questions as definitively as possible. It reports the findings of The National Study of Youth and Religion, the largest and most detailed such study ever undertaken. The NYSR conducted a nationwide telephone survey of teens and significant caregivers, as well as nearly 300 in-depth face-to-face interviews with a sample of the population that was surveyed. The results show that religion and spirituality are indeed very significant in the lives of many American teenagers. Among many other discoveries, they find that teenagers are far more influenced by the religious beliefs and practices of their parents and caregivers than commonly thought. They refute the conventional wisdom that teens are ""spiritual but not religious."" And they confirm that greater religiosity is significantly associated with more positive adolescent life outcomes.

He has often argued that language change is inevitable and in general culturally neutral-languages change rapidly even in indigenous cultures where traditions perpetuate; and among modernized peoples, culture endures despite linguistic shifts. But in his provocative new book, <i>Doing Our Own Thing</i>, McWhorter draws the line when it comes to how cultural change is turning the English language upside down in America today, and how public English is being overwhelmed by street English, with serious consequences for our writing, our music, and our society. <br /><br /> McWhorter explores the triumph of casual over formal speech-particularly since the dawn of 1960s counterculture-and its effect on Americans' ability to write, read, critique, argue, and imagine. In the face of this growing rift between written English and spoken English, the intricate vocabularies and syntactic roadmaps of our language appear to be slipping away, eroding our intellectual and artistic capacities. He argues that ""our increasing alienation from 'written language' signals a gutting of our intellectual powers, our self-regard as a nation, and thus our very substance as a people."" <br /><br /> Timely, thought-provoking, and compellingly written, <i>Doing Our Own Thing</i> is sure to stoke many debates about the fate of our threatened intellectual culture, and the destiny of our democracy.",3.62,304,Hardcover, ,38,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/607865.Doing_Our_Own_Thing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/607865.Doing_Our_Own_Thing

What at first seems like a thrilling puzzle waiting to be deciphered soon turns into a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, where no one—not family, not friends, not lovers—is to be trusted. <br /><br />Moving between twenty-first-century America and seventeenth-century England, The Book of Air and Shadows is a modern thriller that brilliantly re-creates William Shakespeare's life at the turn of the seventeenth century and combines an ingenious and intricately layered plot with a devastating portrait of a contemporary man on the brink of self-discovery . . . or self-destruction.",3.38,466,Hardcover, ,1080,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/609801.The_Book_of_Air_and_Shadows,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/609801.The_Book_of_Air_and_Shadows

These works develop into a Rashomon-like story, introducing us to illustrious Sanjanian figures such as the repentant prostitute Pigeon Blackhat and the magically talented couple Caesar and Endurance. <br /><br /> The result is a vibrant evocation of a country-from the birth pangs of its first settlers and their hardy vernacular to its revolutionary years and all the way to the present-all told in Stephen Marche's innovative and accomplished writing.",3.42,256,Hardcover, ,24,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/610041.Shining_at_the_Bottom_of_the_Sea,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/610041.Shining_at_the_Bottom_of_the_Sea

In her brief yet fruitful life, she was variously author, editor, literary and social critic, journalist, poet, and revolutionary. She was also one of the few female members of the prestigious Transcendentalist movement, whose ranks included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and many other prominent New England intellectuals of the day. As co-editor of the transcendentalist journal, <i>The Dial</i>, Fuller was able to give voice to her groundbreaking social critique on woman's place in society, the genesis of the book that was later to become <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i>. Published in 1843, this essay was entitled ""The Great Lawsuit: Man versus Men, Woman versus Women.""<br />First published in book form in 1845, <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i> was correctly perceived as the controversial document that it was: receiving acclaim and achieving popular success in some quarters (the first printing sold out within a week), at the same time that it inspired vicious attacks from opponents of the embryonic women's movement. In this book, whose style is characterized by the trademark textual diversity of the transcendentalists, Fuller articulates values arising from her passionate belief in justice and equality for all humankind, with a particular focus on women. Although her notion of basic rights certainly includes those of an educational, economic, and legal nature, it is intellectual expansion and changes in the prevailing attitudes towards women (by men and women) that Fuller cherishes far above the superficial manifestations of liberation. A classic of feminist thought that helped bring about the Seneca Falls Women's Convention three years after its publication, <i>Woman in the Nineteenth Century</i> inspired her contemporaries Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony to speak of Fuller as possessing ""more influence upon the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time.""",3.64,132,Paperback, ,32,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/611523.Woman_in_the_Nineteenth_Century,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/611523.Woman_in_the_Nineteenth_Century

In his new collection, he explores a war–torn Balkan world in which a schoolchild's innocence evaporates in a puff of cannon smoke, lust replaces love, and the joy of survival overrides all other pleasures.<br /><br />As Serb, Croat, and Bosnian Muslim armies clash in the cities and countryside of the former Yugoslavia, it's hard to tell the front lines from the home front. The characters in Infidelities––soldiers and civilians alike––are caught in the ridiculous, often cruelly whimsical contradictions of war and the paranoia and folly of those who conduct it. In ""Ribs,"" a Croatian woman whose husband has already been taken by the war will go to any length to keep her son out of the army, including sleeping with the draft officer, a tryst that leads to an unexpected, and disturbing, spiritual vision. A Buddhist soldier in the Bosnian Muslim military isly accused of being an informer to the enemy Serbs after his detachment ambushes itself in ""Hail."" A draft dodger is in the hospital for a transplant, in ""A Purple Heart,"" when a high–ranking Croatian general steals the heart for himself (and dies) while the dodger suddenly discovers a new thirst for life.

She has four mansions on three continents, her own private jet, glittering jewels, designer dresses galore. But in reality she lives in a gilded cage. She has no freedom, no control over her own life, no value but as a bearer of sons. Hidden behind her black floor-length veil, she is a prisoner, jailed by her father, her husband, her sons, and her country.Sultana is a member of the Saudi royal family, closely related to the king. For the sake of her daughters, she has decided to take the risk of speaking out about the life of women in her country, regardless of their rank. She must hide her identity for fear that the religious leaders in her country would call for her death to punish her honesty. Only a woman in her position could possibly hope to escape from being revealed and punished, despite her cloak and anonymity. Sultana tells of her own life, from her turbulent childhood to her arranged marriage--a happy one until her husband decided to displace her by taking a second wife--and of the lives of her sisters, her friends and her servants. Although they share affection, confidences and an easy camaraderie within the confines of the women's quarters, they also share a history of appalling oppression, everyday occurrences that in any other culture would be seen as shocking human rights violations; thirteen-year-old girls forced to marry men five times their age, young women killed by drowning, stoning, or isolation in the women's room, a padded, windowless cell where women are confined with neither light nor conversation until death claims them.By speaking out, Sultana risks bringing the wrath of the Saudi establishment upon her head and the heads of her children.

The last book of its kind, which was published more than 20 years ago, predated the development of such significant concepts as borderline syndromes, narcissistic pathology, dissociative disorders and self-defeating personality.<br />Contemporary students often react with bewilderment to the language of pioneering analysts like Reich and Fenichel and, since 1980, the various volumes of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) have reflected an empirical-descriptive orientation that deliberately eschews psychodynamic assumptions. Consequently, today's therapist in training may have little exposure to the rich clinical and theoretical history behind each disorder mentioned in DSM; to psychoanalytic expertise with widely recognized character patterns not mentioned in DSM, such as depressive and hypomanic psychologies, high-functioning schizoid personalities, and hysterical personalities; or to a comprehensive, theoretically sophisticated rationale that links assessment to treatment. <br />Filling the need for a text that clearly lays out the conceptual heritage that psychoanalytic practitioners take for granted, this important new volume explicates the major clinically important character types and suggests how an appreciation of the patients' individual personality structure should influence the therapist's focus and style of intervention. Dispensing with the dense jargon that often discourages people from learning, Nancy McWilliams writes in a lucid, personal manner that demystifies psychodynamic theory and practice. Innumerable clinical vignettes are presented with humor, candor, and compassion, bringing abstract concepts to life.<br />Comprehensive in scope, <i>Psychoanalytic Diagnosis</i> will be valued by seasoned clinicians and students alike.

Our author, however, gives us a Greek art in Latin dress, combining a Roman spirit with Greek doctrine. It is a technical manual, systematic and formal in arrangement; its exposition is bald, but in greatest part clear and precise. Indeed the writer's specific aims are to achieve clarity and conciseness, and to complete the exposition of his subject with reasonable speed. He seeks clarity through the use of Roman terms, and of specially selected examples; he seeks conciseness by keeping practical needs always in view, by scrupulously avoiding irrelevant matter, and by presenting methods and principles, not a host of particular illustrations of a given point.",3.98,496,Hardcover,Loeb Classical Library #403,28,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615103.Rhetorica_ad_Herennium,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615103.Rhetorica_ad_Herennium

Diligently treating the drug addicts of Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside with sympathy in his heart and legislative reform in mind can't be easy. But Maté never judges. His book is a powerful call-to-arms, both for the decriminalization of drugs and for a more sympathetic and informed view of addiction. As Maté observes, ""Those whom we dismiss as 'junkies' are not creatures from a different world, only men and women mired at the extreme end of a continuum on which, here or there, all of us might well locate ourselves."" <i>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts</i> begins by introducing us to many of Dr. Maté's most dire patients who steal, cheat, sell sex, and otherwise harm themselves for their next hit. Maté looks to the root causes of addiction, applying a clinical and psychological view to the physical manifestation and offering some enlightening answers for why people inflict such catastrophe on themselves.<br /><br />Finally, he takes aim at the hugely ineffectual, largely U.S.-led War on Drugs (and its worldwide followers), challenging the wisdom of fighting drugs instead of aiding the addicts, and showing how controversial measures such as safe injection sites are measurably more successful at reducing drug-related crime and the spread of disease than anything most major governments have going. It's not easy reading, but we ignore his arguments at our peril. When it comes to combating the drug trade and the ravages of addiction, society can use all the help it can get. <i>--Kim Hughes</i>",4.48,480,Hardcover, ,696,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/617702.In_the_Realm_of_Hungry_Ghosts,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/617702.In_the_Realm_of_Hungry_Ghosts

Usability experts stress the pitfalls of frames and too many images on Web pages. They recommend editing out unnecessary words and writing in a non-linear style-all valuable advice, of course. But less frequently do they highlight the importance of the visual presentation of Web pages.<br /><br /> The Web is a communication medium that does most of its talking visually. What you see on a Web page tells you what you might find within the site, how to get there, and why it might interest you-not to mention the instinctive emotional response that shapes your Web experience. As a result, Web usability issues are communication issues. Easy-to-use sites are those that communicate quickly and effectively.<br /><br /> Site-Seeing takes a fresh approach to Web usability by applying visual communication principles and decision-making to Web design. Specifically, readers will learn the key concepts behind visual organization, look and feel, technical considerations, and clear planning that stem from audience awareness. Through numerous, full-color examples author Luke Wroblewski deconstructs ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" of Web design.<br /><br /> The visual presentation of a site does more than merely making it pretty. It organizes information according to function. It creates distinct and appropriate personalities. It provides emotional impact and attachment. In short, it engages the audience-and keeps them coming back.",3.73,364,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/626634.Site_Seeing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/626634.Site_Seeing

By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood.

He was the father of modern polar exploration, the last act of territorial discovery before the leap into space began.<br />Nansen was a prime illustration of Carlyle's dictum that 'the history of the world is but the biography of great men'. He was not merely a pioneer in the wildly diverse fields of oceanography and skiing, but one of the founders of neurology. A restless, unquiet Faustian spirit, Nansen was a Renaissance Man born out of his time into the new Norway of Ibsen and Grieg. He was an artist and historian, a diplomat who had dealings with Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin, and played a part in the Versailles Peace Conference, where he helped the Americans in their efforts to contain the Bolsheviks. He also undertook famine relief in Russia. Finally, working for the League of Nations as both High Commissioner for Refugees and High Commissioner for the Repatriation of Prisoners of War, he became the first of the modern media-conscious international civil servants.",4.13,768,Paperback, ,18,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630210.Nansen,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630210.Nansen

They are written for the non-specialist but include new and important findings, making them equally valuable for academics across a range of disciplines. <br />The Nineteenth Century is the inaugural volume in the series and covers the peak of Britain's world power. The book sets out to describe the force and complexity of that experience, and to cover, in an interdisciplinary way, the political, economic, and cultural history of the British Isles between 1815 and 1901. It looks at the Victorian economy, as well as Victorian public life, as a cultural and political narrative. It includes chapters on women and domesticity; the interplay of religion, intellect, and science; art; architecture and the city; and the literature, theater, and music of the time.

It is the tragic monologue of a woman speaking with the child she carries in her womb. This letter confronts the burning theme of abortion, and the meaning of life, by asking difficult questions: Is it fair to impose life even if it means suffering? Would it be better not to be born at all?<br />Letter to a Child Never Born touches on the real meaning of being a woman: the power to give life or not. When the book begins, the protagonist is upset after learning she is pregnant. She knows nothing about the child, except that this creature depends totally and uniquely on her own choices. The creation of another person directly within one’s own body is a very shocking thing. The sense of responsibility is huge; it is a heavy burden that gives life to endless reflections, from the origin of our existence to the shame of our selfishness. If the child could choose, would he prefer to be born, to grow up, and to suffer, or would he return to the joyful limbo from which he came? A woman’s freedom and individuality are also challenged by a newborn—should she renounce her freedom, her job, and her choice? What should she do at this point?",3.93, , , ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630609._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630609._

Spence's meticulous research has, perhaps most notably, uncovered evidence that Austen and the charming young Irishman Tom Lefroy fell in love at the age of twenty and that the relationship inspired Pride and Prejudice, one of the most celebrated works of fiction ever written. Becoming Jane Austen gives the fullest account we have of the romance, which was more serious and more enduring than previously believed. Seeing this love story in the context of Jane Austen's whole life enables us to appreciate the profound effect the relationship had on her art and on subsequent choices that she made in her life.<br /><br />Full of insight and with an attentive eye for detail, Spence explores Jane Austen's emotional attachments and the personal influences that shaped her as a novelist. His elegant narrative provides a point of entry into Jane Austen's world as she herself perceived and experienced it. It is a world familiar to us from her novels, but in Becoming Jane Austen, Austen herself is the heroine.",3.74,312,Paperback, ,235,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636674.Becoming_Jane_Austen,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636674.Becoming_Jane_Austen

With the Bush family, the Saudis hit a gusher -- direct access to presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush. To trace the amazing weave of Saud- Bush connections, Unger interviewed three former directors of the CIA, top Saudi and Israeli intelligence officials, and more than one hundred other sources. His access to major players is unparalleled and often exclusive -- including executives at the Carlyle Group, the giant investment firm where the House of Bush and the House of Saud each has a major stake. <br /> Like Bob Woodward's <i>The Veil,</i> Unger's <i>House of Bush, House of Saud</i> features unprecedented reportage; like Michael Moore's <i>Dude, Where's My Country?</i> Unger's book offers a political counter-narrative to official explanations; this deeply sourced account has already been cited by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer, and sets 9/11, the two Gulf Wars, and the ongoing Middle East crisis in a new context: What really happened when America's most powerful political family became seduced by its Saudi counterparts?",3.88,384,Paperback, ,82,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636758.House_of_Bush_House_of_Saud,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/636758.House_of_Bush_House_of_Saud

Sula and Nel--both black, both smart, both poor, raised in a small Ohio town--meet when they are twelve, wishbone thin and dreaming of princes.<br /><br />Through their girlhood years they share everything--perceptions, judgments, yearnings, secrets, even crime--until Sula gets out, out of the Bottom, the hilltop neighborhood where beneath the sporting life of the men hanging around the place in headrags and soft felt hats there hides a fierce resentment at failed crops, lost jobs, thieving insurance men, bug-ridden flour...at the invisible line that cannot be overstepped. <br /><br />Sula leaps it and roams the cities of America for ten years. Then she returns to the town, to her friend. But Nel is a wife now, settled with her man and her three children. She belongs. She accommodates to the Bottom, where you avoid the hand of God by getting in it, by staying <i>upright,</i> helping out at church suppers, asking after folks--where you deal with evil by surviving it. <br /><br />Not Sula. As willing to feel pain as to give pain, she can never accommodate. Nel can't understand her any more, and the others never did. Sula scares them. Mention her now, and they recall that she put her grandma in an old folks' home (the old lady who let a train take her leg for the insurance)...that a child drowned in the river years ago...that there was a plague of robins when she first returned...<br /><br />In clear, dark, resonant language, Toni Morrison brilliantly evokes not only a bond between two lives, but the harsh, loveless, ultimately mad world in which that bond is destroyed, the world of the Bottom and its people, through forty years, up to the time of their bewildered realization that even more than they feared Sula, their pariah, they needed her.",3.94,192,Hardcover, ,40,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/638794.Sula,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/638794.Sula

Rudolf Höß était le commandant du camp de concentration et d'extermination d'Auschwitz pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale.<br /><br />L'histoire commence en 1913 alors que Rudolf Lang a 13 ans.<br /><br />Il reçoit une éducation catholique mal comprise et très normative. Son père, un commerçant, ayant reçu une éducation militaire (famille militaire), totalement psychorigide, qui a commis un péché dans sa jeunesse à Paris et avec qui il entretient des rapports tendus, veut qu'il devienne prêtre pour expier les fautes que lui-même a commises. Rudolf croit en Dieu, jusqu'au jour où, en se battant avec un de ses camarades d'école (Werner), il lui casse la jambe. Immédiatement, il va se confesser à un prêtre. Le soir même, son père devient fou de rage après avoir appris que son fils a commis un « péché » sans lui en parler. Rudolf se sent trahi par le prêtre, seule personne au courant de l'épisode, les autres croyant à un accident. Or, on apprendra que c'est en fait le père de l'enfant blessé qui s'est plaint devant une assemblée de parents d'élèves. Le mal est fait : Rudolf ne croit plus en Dieu. Son père meurt peu avant la déclaration de guerre en 1914.<br /><br />À seize ans, Lang débute sa carrière militaire, d'abord en partant directement pour le front Ouest où il sera intercepté puis renvoyé à l'arrière car il est trop jeune, puis comme aide à l'hôpital militaire où il rencontrera un dragon de cavalerie qui le persuadera de rentrer dans son unité et de partir sur le front en Turquie.<br /><br />À la fin de la guerre, il se retrouve au chômage, rejeté par sa famille. Il s'apprête à se suicider lorsqu'un de ses collègues arrive et lui brandit un tract en lui disant de ne pas trahir l'Allemagne en se donnant la mort.<br /><br />Il adhère au parti nazi et se voit confier la direction d'une ferme avec sa femme Elsie, où il vit des journées de dur labeur, mais paisibles. Puis, après la prise du pouvoir par Hitler, il entre dans les SS, n'ayant pourtant pas les critères requis pour y adhérer. Il accède à des fonctions de plus en plus importantes dans la hiérarchie SS, jusqu'à devenir commandant du camp d'Auschwitz. Ce camp, d'abord de concentration, puis d'extermination, devient le lieu de la lente et tâtonnante mise au point de l'Usine de Mort du village d'Auschwitz. Il y reçoit l'ordre du Reichsführer Himmler de supprimer 500 000 unités par an au lieu des ridicules 80 000 unités de Treblinka. Lang va s'attacher à accomplir la mission qui lui a été assignée : tuer le plus grand nombre de Juifs et éliminer le plus efficacement possible les cadavres. Après la guerre et la chute d'Hitler, il est emprisonné, puis condamné à la pendaison après son procès où il affirmera avoir seulement suivi les ordres, indiquant d'un air naturel qu'il a supervisé et participé activement au meurtre de « seulement » 2,5 millions de personnes au lieu des 3,5 millions prévus3.<br /><br />Tout au long du livre, il se montre incapable de sentiments et même d'action personnelle, car sa conduite lui a toujours été dictée par un chef en qui il portait une confiance totale. À la fin, on le sent cependant en colère se disant trahi par Himmler, qui, tel un lâche, s'est suicidé, et n'a ainsi pas voulu assumer son rôle dans l'extermination des Juifs, laissant Rudolf seul responsable de ses actes. Jusqu'au bout, il assume cependant son idée du chef, en répétant froidement et méthodiquement qu'il est le seul responsable de ce qui s'est passé à Auschwitz, et en énonçant sans difficulté les atrocités commises. Son seul moment de doute survient lorsque sa femme apprend ses activités, mais, ayant été choisi pour ses rares qualités de conscience il n'accorde pas d'importance à la morale.",4.35,464,Paperback, ,36,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/640690._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/640690._

There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. <br /><br />Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. <br /><br />In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place. <br /><br />Description from Amazon.com",3.77,160,Hardcover, ,1198,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641604.Purple_Cow,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641604.Purple_Cow

The guiding theme of these reflections on language is found in Heidegger's lecture notes for a 1939 seminar that focused on J. G. Herder's treatise <i>On the Origin of Language</i>. This course, given just after the completion of his <i>Contributions to Philosophy</i>, sheds new light on the force of language in Heidegger's thought and shows the first openings to his later, better-known works dedicated to the topic of language. The result of this project is to outline how it is that thinking the being of the word moves out of metaphysics into the poetic word and its relation to history. A crucial work, this course brings the reader close to a decisive moment in Heidegger's thought, letting us see how he struggled forward to new ways of thinking how it is that ""language as language"" can be thought.",3.84,189,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641815.On_the_Essence_of_Language,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641815.On_the_Essence_of_Language

A correspondent for the <i>Toronto Star,</i> Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braque and Picasso were experimenting with cubist form; James Joyce, long living in self-imposed exile from his native Dublin, had just completed <i>Ulysses;</i> Gertrude Stein held court at 27 Rue de Fleurus, and deemed young Ernest a member of <i>une gneration perdue;</i> and T.S. Eliot was a bank clerk in London. It was during these years that the as-of-yet unpublished young writer gathered the material for his first novel <i>The Sun Also Rises,</i> and the subsequent masterpieces that followed.<br /><p>Among these small, reflective sketches are unforgettable encounters with the members of Hemingway's slightly rag-tag circle of artists and writers, some also fated to achieve fame and glory, others to fall into obscurity. Here, too, is an evocation of the Paris that Hemingway knew as a young man - a map drawn in his distinct prose of the streets and cafes and bookshops that comprised the city in which he, as a young writer, sometimes struggling against the cold and hunger of near poverty, honed the skills of his craft.<br /></p><p><i>A Moveable Feast</i> is at once an elegy to the remarkable group for expatriates that gathered in Paris during the twenties and a testament to the risks and rewards of the writerly life.</p>",4.03, , , ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641996._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641996._

It ended in August, with seven desperate children in search of a creature of unspeakable evil in the drains beneath Derry. In search of It. And somehow it ended.<br /><br />Or so they thought. Then.<br /><br />On a spring night in 1985 Mike Hanlon, once one of those children, makes six calls. Stan Uris, accountant. Richie ""Records"" Tozier, L.A. disc jockey. Ben Hanscom, renowned architect. Beverly Rogan, dress designer. Eddie Kaspbrak, owner of a successful New York limousine company. And Bill Denbrough, bestselling writer of horror novels, Bill Denbrough who now only stutters in his dreams. <br /><br />These six men and one woman have forgotten their childhoods,have forgotten the time when they were Losers...but an unremembered promise draws them back, the present begins to rhyme dreadfully with the past, and when the Losers reunite, the wheels of fate lock together and roll them towards the ultimate terror.<br /><br />In the biggest and most ambitious book of his career, Stephen King gives us not only his most towering epic of horror but a surprising re-illumination of the corridor where we pass from the bright mysteries of childhood to those of maturity.<br />--front flap",4.24,1142,Hardcover, ,560,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/644173.It,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/644173.It

Browning’s shocking account of how a unit of average middle-aged Germans became the cold-blooded murderers of tens of thousands of Jews—now with a new afterword and additional photographs. <br /><br /><i>Ordinary Men</i> is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of  RPB 101 were not fanatical Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.<br /><br />While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition.  <br /><br /><i>Ordinary Men</i> is a powerful, chilling, and important work, with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.  ",4.10,271,Paperback, ,640,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/647492.Ordinary_Men,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/647492.Ordinary_Men

The chakras, kundalini, mudras, shakti, nadis, bandhas, and many other topics are explained. This is the first edition of the classic manual on Hatha Yoga to meet high academic, literary, and production standards. It’s for people who practice Yoga, and for anyone with an interest in heath and fitness, philosophy, religion, spirituality, mysticism, or meditation.<br /><br />From the Introduction:<br />Over the last half millennium, one book has established itself as the classic work on Hatha Yoga—the book you are holding in your hands. An Indian yogi named Svatmarama wrote the Hatha Yoga Pradipika in the fifteenth century C.E. Drawing on his own experience and older works now lost, he wrote this book for the student of Yoga. He wrote this book for you.<br /><br />Sample Verses:<br />Yoga succeeds by these six: enthusiasm, openness, courage, knowledge of the truth, determination, and solitude.<br /><br />Success is achieved neither by wearing the right clothes nor by talking about it. Practice alone brings success. This is the truth, without a doubt.<br /><br />When the breath is unsteady, the mind is unsteady. When the breath is steady, the mind is steady, and the yogi becomes steady. Therefore one should restrain the breath.<br /><br />As salt and water become one when mixed, so the unity of self and mind is called samadhi.<br /><br />He who binds the breath, binds the mind. He who binds the mind, binds the breath.<br /><br />Center the self in space and space in the self. Make everything space, then don’t think of anything.<br /><br />Empty within, empty without, empty like a pot in space. Full within, full without, full like a pot in the ocean.<br /><br />Don’t think of external things and don’t think of internal things. Abandon all thoughts, then don’t think of anything.<br /><br />Reviews:<br />“Beautifully printed and translated. Wonderful pictures, too.”<br />—Dominik Wujastyk, Indology<br /><br />“Accurate and accompanied by clear pictures, this translation of an informative Sanskrit text is a very useful addition to the growing literature on Yoga in Western languages.”<br />—Ashok Aklujkar, University of British Columbia<br /><br />“Written over five-hundred years ago, the text is considered by many a seminal work on the practice of Hatha Yoga.”<br />—Chris Meehan, Kalamazoo Gazette<br /><br />“His style is straightforward, clear, and elegant. . . . the people at YogaVidya.com are to be complimented for bringing this text to the general public and for doing so in a most attractive manner. This is the book you want after you have finished with the popular texts.”<br />—Dennis Littrell, Amazon<br /><br />“There is a certain magic at work here—it is as if an Indian yogi named Svatmarama has projected himself through time, expressing himself through Akers. . . . Part of the charm of Akers’s translation is that he breathes life into the ancient text by retaining its esoteric barriers and anachronisms, while at the same time clearly and simply presenting useful postures for students of Yoga. The book is well illustrated with photographs that depict a model demonstrating the postures. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika is a must for serious students of Yoga, and for those of us not so serious, it is informative and entertainingly readable.”<br />—Michael Perkins, Woodstock Times<br /><br />“Ably translated into English by Brian Dana Akers, The Hatha Yoga Pradipika is the classic source book on Hatha Yoga. . . . This faithful reproduction of the crucial text features the original Sanskrit side-by-side with the exacting English translation. . . . an impressive and highly recommended reference for students and devoted practitioners of Hatha Yoga.”<br />—Midwest Book Review<br /><br />“One of the key texts that we recommend to all of our students and graduates.”<br />—Train Yoga Instructor Courses<br /><br />“Your introduction and translation of the text is a delight to read. I’m eager to teach it.”<br />—Christian Lee Novetzke, University of Washington<br /><br />“One of the key texts of Yoga - I love this translation - it’s so readable and simple.”<br />—Sarah Raspin, Oak Tree Yoga<br /><br />“A new, crisp, no-nonsense translation of this great classic on the practice of Hatha Yoga. . . . If one, like me, holds that the work of the translator is to be as discreet as possible, then this very faithful translation is probably the best available. . . . The publisher, YogaVidya.com, also produces a version of the Gheranda Samhita, and, I am told, is working on the Shiva Samhita.

Healthy soil is teeming with life — not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants, and thus become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial substances, many of them toxic to humans as well as other forms of life. But there is an alternative to this vicious circle: to garden in a way that strengthens, rather than destroys, the soil food web — the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. By eschewing jargon and overly technical language, the authors make the benefits of cultivating the soil food web available to a wide audience, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals.<br />",4.40,196,Hardcover, ,89,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/655223.Teaming_with_Microbes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/655223.Teaming_with_Microbes

He was also one of the most remarkable double agents Britain has ever produced. Inside the traitor was a man of loyalty; inside the villain was a hero. The problem for Chapman, his spymasters, and his lovers was to know where one persona ended and the other began.<br /><br />In 1941, after training as a German spy in occupied France, Chapman was parachuted into Britain with a revolver, a wireless, and a cyanide pill, with orders from the Abwehr to blow up an airplane factory. Instead, he contacted MI5, the British Secret Service. For the next four years, Chapman worked as a double agent, a lone British spy at the heart of the German Secret Service who at one time volunteered to assassinate Hitler for his countrymen. Crisscrossing Europe under different names, all the while weaving plans, spreading disinformation, and, miraculously, keeping his stories straight under intense interrogation, he even managed to gain some profit and seduce beautiful women along the way.<br /><br />The Nazis feted Chapman as a hero and awarded him the Iron Cross. In Britain, he was pardoned for his crimes, becoming the only wartime agent to be thus rewarded. Both countries provided for the mother of his child and his mistress. Sixty years after the end of the war, and ten years after Chapman’s death, MI5 has now declassified all of Chapman’s files, releasing more than 1,800 pages of top secret material and allowing the full story of Agent Zigzag to be told for the first time.<br /><br />A gripping story of loyalty, love, and treachery, <i>Agent Zigzag</i> offers a unique glimpse into the psychology of espionage, with its thin and shifting line between fidelity and betrayal.",4.10,364,Hardcover, ,974,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/655627.Agent_Zigzag,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/655627.Agent_Zigzag

The billionaire commanded his empire by correspondence, scrawling thousands of handwritten memos to unseen henchmen. It was the only time Howard Hughes risked writing down his orders, plans, thoughts, fears, and desires. Hughes claimed the papers were so sensitive—“the very most confidential, almost sacred information as to my innermost activities”—that not even his most trusted aides or executives were allowed to keep the messages he sent them. But in the early-morning hours of June 5, 1974, unknown burglars staged a daring break-in at Hughes’s supposedly impregnable headquarters and escaped with all the confidential files. Despite a top-secret FBI investigation and a million-dollar CIA buyback bid, none of the stolen secret papers were ever found—until investigative reporter Michael Drosnin cracked the case.<br />In <i>Citizen Hughes</i>, Drosnin reveals the true story of the great Hughes heist—and of the real Howard Hughes. Based on nearly ten thousand never-before-published documents, more than three thousand in Hughes’s own handwriting, <i>Citizen Hughes</i> is far more than a biography, or even an unwilling autobiography.

The authors, however, bring this story alive in a fast-moving book, and the reader sees how events of that time are very relevant for today's financial world. In spite of all of our advances, including a stronger monetary system and modern tools for managing risk, Bruner and Carr help us understand that we are not immune to a future crisis.-<br /> --Dwight B. Crane, Baker Foundation Professor, Harvard Business School -Bruner and Carr provide a thorough, masterly, and highly readable account of the 1907 crisis and its management by the great private banker J. P. Morgan. Congress heeded the lessons of 1907, launching the Federal Reserve System in 1913 to prevent banking panics and foster financial stability. We still have financial problems. But because of 1907 and Morgan, a century later we have a respected central bank as well as greater confidence in our money and our banks than our great-grandparents had in theirs.-<br /> --Richard Sylla, Henry Kaufman Professor of the History of Financial Institutions and Markets, and Professor of Economics, Stern School of Business, New York University<br /><br />-A fascinating portrayal of the events and personalities of the crisis and panic of 1907. Lessons learned and parallels to the present have great relevance. Crises and panics are as much a part of our future as our past.-<br /> --John Strangfeld, Vice Chairman, Prudential Financial<br /><br />-Who would have thought that a hundred years after the Panic of 1907 so much remained to be written about it? Bruner and Carr break significant new ground because they are willing to do the heavy lifting of combing through massive archival material to identify and weave together important facts. Their book will be of interest not only to banking theorists and financial historians, but also to business school and economics students, for its rare ability to teach so clearly why and how a panic unfolds.-<br /> --Charles Calomiris, Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions, Columbia University, Graduate School of Business",3.85,258,Hardcover, ,55,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658129.The_Panic_of_1907,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658129.The_Panic_of_1907

The vintage stories in the Q School's near and distant past tell of emotional and physical breakdown---and courage, as well---under pressure: Jim Carter's self-confessed ""choke stories"" of 1990 and 1992; Mark McCumber's recurring lost-scorecard nightmare; Peter Jacobsen's ordeal with a cheater on the Mexican border; Jim McLean's bizarre arrest on the qualifier's eve; and Mac O'Grady's violent celebration of his long-awaited Q School success. The players captured in these pages turn white with panic, vomit their breakfast, sleep in their cars, practice on interstate ranges, lose golf shoes, forget contact lenses and make fateful decisions based on faulty information.<br /><br />Sifting back through several eras, Gould explains the innocent aims of the first Q Schools and uncovers the tournament's pivotal role in the momentous split-up of the PGA and the PGA TOUR. He examines the difficult question of how professional golf should go about bringing in new players and letting former players regain their privileges. In the voices of forgotten or never-known tour pros from the 1970s, he narrates the frustrating ""rabbit era"" that Q School helped create, and revisits the infamous ""breakaway Q School"" of 1968. In notes that accompany this book's exclusive year-by-year scoring records, the author picks out hidden turning points, bits of trivia and strange coincidences in the lives of tour players past and present.<br /><br />These profiles and snapshots of the earliest Q School survivors and the most recent graduates, as well, are woven together in a warm, engaging and insightful narrative. <i>Q School Confidential</i>, sometimes bleak, sometimes triumphant, provides the first and only inside look at a cruel and unusual tournament that many consider golf's toughest test of all.",3.88,336,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658246.Q_School_Confidential,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658246.Q_School_Confidential

  <i>Strong Motion</i>
</a>, now claims a place in that tradition with <i>The Corrections,</i> his funny, desolating, unsparing account of a divided, deeply unhappy American family.<br /><br /><p>At times evocative of two classic portraits of domestic and spiritual malaise, Richard Yates's <a href=""http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0375708448"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><i>Revolutionary Road</i></a> and Joseph Heller's <a href=""http://cart2.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0684841215"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><i>Something Happened</i></a>, <i>The Corrections</i> ultimately stands squarely on its own. The narrative focuses on three critical months in the history of the Lambert family, longtime residents of the fictional midwestern city of St. Jude. Albert, the patriarch, is a once-formidable figure whose frequent rages and implacable rectitude have dominated life in the Lambert household for nearly 50 years. As the novel begins, Albert had just been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Against the perfectly articulated background of his physical and mental deterioration, Enid -- Albert's long-suffering, perpetually dissatisfied wife -- develops a single, overriding obsession: to see her scattered family return to St. Jude for one last Christmas together.</p> <br /><br /><p>The bulk of the story depicts the disordered lives of the three departed Lambert children: Gary, a grasping, increasingly unhappy investment banker with family troubles of his own; Chip, a former professor and failed screenwriter who drifts into a dangerous, highly illegal investment scam in economically depressed Lithuania; and Denise, a gifted chef lost in a maze of sexual confusion and ""moral chaos."" In time, and by various circuitous routes, all three will find their way to that climactic Christmas in St. Jude, and to a final confrontation with the ghosts of the past, a confrontation that is painful, tragic, and liberating, all at once.</p><br /><br /><p>Supremely intelligent and deeply affecting, <i>The Corrections</i> anatomizes both a family and a society, gracefully illuminating the inner lives of a handful of characters struggling to escape ""the givens of the self,"" and to find and apply ""the corrections"" that will transform and redeem their lives. Through a combination of wit, empathy, and precise observation, Franzen himself transforms the familiar materials of domestic drama into something luminous and new, giving us a powerful, often beautiful novel of clear -- and possibly enduring -- significance. <i>(Bill Sheehan)</i></p>",3.80,568,Hardcover, ,211,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658770.The_Corrections,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/658770.The_Corrections

Too few people do. In fact, surveys show that 80 to 95 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with their jobs. Considering that most of us will work nearly 100,000 hours during our lifetimes (half the waking hours of our entire adult lives!), it's sad that our work doesn't bring us the rewards--both financial and emotional--that we deserve. <i>Love Your Job!</i> looks at the people behind the statistics and at the emotions those people feel: how they may fear change in their jobs, how they strive for a better life at work and home, and how they sometimes truly can love what they do for a living.<br /><br />Dr. Paul Powers is a management psychologist who has helped all kinds of people--from CEOs to mechanics, from returning war vets to new graduates--find and keep jobs they love. In <i>Love Your Job!</i> he shares his experience and his heartfelt belief that people can go beyond the day-to-day obligations and stresses of their jobs to get more out of the hours, weeks, and years they spend at work and find real meaning in what they do.<br /><br />There are many long, boring, and sometimes cynical books on how to write a resume, dress for success, and look the interviewer in the eye; <i>Love Your Job!</i> isn't one of them. Rather than showing you how to manipulate your way into getting a better-paying job, it encourages you to look inside yourself at what is really important to you and to bring your best self to your work, whatever it may be.<br /><br />In a series of one-page reflections, anecdotes, and exercises, <i>Love Your Job!</i> can be read either from start to finish or in small doses, when you need to lift your spirits. The book contains four sections, as well as an introduction and resource list:<br /><br /><br />What does it mean to love your job? Reflections on what work means to you and what's important in a job. Can you keep loving your job? Solid advice and motivational exercises that will help you develop the skills and the courage to make changes in the job you're in. What if you don't have a job you love? Practical and inspirational hints for looking at your skills, meeting people who can help you, and overcoming your fear of change. Is there life outside your job? Reflections on how you can find time for your families and communities, as well as your job. The <i>Love Your Job!</i> exercises give this book a special focus. They range from practical (e.g., listing your skills and networking contacts) to deeply emotional (e.g., dreaming about the job or life you want to have, confronting your fears of both failure and success).<br /><br /><i>Love Your Job!</i> informs you, inspires you, and challenges you, not only to look outside at the world of work, but also to look inside yourself at what work means to you.",2.50,210,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/660034.Love_Your_Job_,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/660034.Love_Your_Job_

But ""the West"" is the more dangerous mirage of our own time, Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit argue, and the idea of ""the West"" in the minds of its self-proclaimed enemies remains largely unexamined and woefully misunderstood. Occidentalism is their groundbreaking investigation of the demonizing fantasies and stereotypes about the Western world that fuel such hatred in the hearts of others.<br /><br />We generally understand ""radical Islam"" as a purely Islamic phenomenon, but Buruma and Margalit show that while the Islamic part of radical Islam certainly is, the radical part owes a primary debt of inheritance to the West. Whatever else they are, al Qaeda and its ilk are revolutionary anti-Western political movements, and Buruma and Margalit show us that the bogeyman of the West who stalks their thinking is the same one who has haunted the thoughts of many other revolutionary groups, going back to the early nineteenth century. In this genealogy of the components of the anti-Western worldview, the same oppositions appear again and again: the heroic revolutionary versus the timid, soft bourgeois; the rootless, deracinated cosmopolitan living in the Western city, cut off from the roots of a spiritually healthy society; the sterile Western mind, all reason and no soul; the machine society, controlled from the center by a cabal of insiders—often Jews—pulling the hidden levers of power versus an organically knit-together one, a society of ""blood and soil."" The anti-Western virus has found a ready host in the Islamic world for a number of legitimate reasons, they argue, but in no way does that make it an exclusively Islamic matter.<br /><br />A work of extraordinary range and erudition, <b>Occidentalism</b> will permanently enlarge our collective frame of vision",3.51,176,Paperback, ,69,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/661211.Occidentalism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/661211.Occidentalism

""In a Grove,"" which was the basis for Kurosawa's classic film <em>Rashomon</em>, tells the chilling story of the killing of a samurai through the testimony of witnesses, including the spirit of the murdered man. The fable-like ""Yam Gruel"" is an account of desire and humiliation, but one in which the reader's sympathy is thoroughly unsettled. And in ""The Martyr,"" a beloved orphan raised by Jesuit priests is exiled when he refuses to admit that he made a local girl pregnant.

Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."" It is typical of Márquez that it will be many pages before his narrative circles back to the ice &amp; many chapters before the hero of One Hundred Years of Solitude stands before the firing squad. In between, he recounts such wonders as an entire town struck with insomnia, a woman who ascends to heaven while hanging laundry &amp; a suicide that defies the laws of physics: ""A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down steps &amp; climbed over curbs, passed along the Street of the Turks, turned a corner to the right &amp; another to the left, made a right angle at the Buendía house, went in under the closed door, crossed thru the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went on to the other living room, made a wide curve to avoid the dining-room table, went along the porch w/the begonias &amp; passed w/out being seen under Amaranta's chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano José, &amp; went thru the pantry &amp; came out in the kitchen, where Úrsula was getting ready to crack 36 eggs to make bread. 'Holy Mother of God!' Úrsula shouted."" The story follows 100 years of Macondo, a village founded by José Arcadio Buendía &amp; occupied by descendants all sporting variations on their progenitor's name: his sons, José Arcadio &amp; Aureliano, &amp; grandsons, Aureliano José, Aureliano Segundo &amp; José Arcadio Segundo. Then there are the women--the two Úrsulas, a handful of Remedios, Fernanda &amp; Pilar--who struggle to remain grounded even as their menfolk build castles in the air. If it's possible for a novel to be highly comic &amp; deeply tragic at the same time, then One Hundred Years does the trick. Civil war rages thruout, hearts break, dreams shatter &amp; lives are lost, yet the effect is literary pentimento, with sorrow's outlines bleeding thru the vibrant colors of Márquez' magical realism. Consider the ghost of Prudencio Aguilar, whom José Arcadio Buendía has killed in a fight. So lonely is the man's shade that it haunts Buendía's house, searching anxiously for water w/which to clean its wound. Buendía's wife, Úrsula, is so moved that ""the next time she saw the dead man uncovering the pots on the stove she understood what he was looking for, &amp; from then on she placed water jugs all about the house."" With One Hundred Years of Solitude Márquez introduced Latin American literature to a worldwide readership.
