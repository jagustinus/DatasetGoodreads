In his work, Heaney explored, recorded, and preserved both the disappearing agrarian life of his origins and the dramatic rise of sectarianism and the subsequent outbreak of the Northern Irish “Troubles” beginning in the late 1960s. At the same time, Heaney consistently imagined a new region of Northern Ireland where the conflicts that have long beset it and, by extension, the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom might be synthesized and resolved. Finally, there is a third region Heaney committed himself to explore and map—the spirit region, that world beyond our ken.    In <i>Seamus Heaney’s Regions</i>, Richard Rankin Russell argues that Heaney’s regions—the first, geographic, historical, political, cultural, linguistic; the second, a future where peace, even reconciliation, might one day flourish; the third, the life beyond this one—offer the best entrance into and a unified understanding of Heaney’s body of work in poetry, prose, translations, and drama. As Russell shows, Heaney believed in the power of ideas—and the texts representing them—to begin resolving historical divisions. For Russell, Heaney’s regionalist poetry contains a “Hegelian synthesis” view of history that imagines potential resolutions to the conflicts that have plagued Ireland and Northern Ireland for centuries. Drawing on extensive archival and primary material by the poet, <i>Seamus Heaney’s Regions </i>examines Heaney’s work from before his first published poetry volume, <i>Death of a Naturalist</i> in 1966, to his most recent volume, the elegiac <i>Human Chain</i> in 2010, to provide the most comprehensive treatment of the poet’s work to date.<br /><br /> ""Richard Rankin Russell's <i>Seamus Heaney's Regions</i> is a major and original contribution; it is hard to think of another critical work on Heaney that is so complete in its coverage, from the earliest activities to Human Chain. Russell is extremely well-versed in Heaney's writings and extends his analysis beyond the usual concentration on the poetry to bring in the crucial prose and dramatic works, including the early, largely forgotten items. The breadth of his approach makes his book of interest to scholars in such neighboring fields as social geography, history, and theology as well as contemporary literature."" —<b>Bernard O'Donoghue, Wadham College, University of Oxford</b><br /><br /> <br />""<i>Seamus Heaney's Regions</i> will be welcomed by the many students and scholars who study Heaney, but also by those interested in the turbulent post–World War II period in Northern Ireland. Since Heaney is one of the best known contemporary poets, Russell's book should appeal to a wide audience. Russell gives readers an overview of Heaney's career. Unlike some studies of Heaney, Russell’s Regions includes many insightful commentaries on his essays and translations."" —<b>Henry Hart, Mildred and J.B. Hickman Professor of English and Humanities, The College of William and Mary </b><br /><br /> <br />""<i>Seamus Heaney’s Regions</i> radically transforms our understanding of the poet’s sense of place, his political consciousness, and his visionary art. Drawing on a wealth of knowledge and extensive archival research, Richard Rankin Russell offers us a superb account of Seamus Heaney as a global regionalist, a poet whose localities extend beyond the national to the spiritual. Thoughtfully attentive to the cultural contours of the writings and sensitively attuned to their formal and stylistic qualities, this is a book that will shape and inform our appreciation of Heaney’s poetic achievements for years to come."" —<b>Stephen Regan, Durham University</b>",4.80,536,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19300261-seamus-heaney-s-regions,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19300261-seamus-heaney-s-regions

To save Harry, his own writing career, and eventually even himself, Marcus must answer three questions, all of which are mysteriously connected: Who killed Nola Kellergan?

Salinger published his first story in <i>The New Yorker</i> at age twenty-nine. Three years later came <i>The Catcher in The Rye</i>, a novel that has sold more than sixty-five million copies and achieved mythic status since its publication in 1951. Subsequent books introduced a new type in contemporary literature: the introspective, hyperarticulate Glass family, whose stage is the Upper East Side. Yet we still know little about Salinger’s personal life and less about his character.<br /><br />This was by design. In 1953, determined to escape media attention, Salinger fled to New Hampshire, where he would live until his death in 2010. Even there, privacy proved elusive: a <i>Time</i> cover story; a memoir by Joyce Maynard (who dropped out of Yale as a freshman to move in with him); and a legal battle over an unauthorized biography, which darkened his last decades. Yet he continued to write, and is rumored to have left behind a mass of work that his estate intends to publish.<br /><br />Thomas Beller, a novelist who grew up in Manhattan, is the ideal guide to Salinger’s world. He gives us a sense of life at <i>The New Yorker</i> (where he was once a staff writer) and a portrait of editor Gus Lobrano, whose relationship with Salinger has rarely been written about. He visits Salinger’s summer camp and the apartment buildings where the author lived. He reads the famous works with obsessive attention, finding in them an image of his own life experience. The result is a quest biography about learning to know yourself in order to know your subject. <i>J.D.

He explores questions like:<br /><br />- How are we stuck in an old framework of productivity that inhibits real innovation?<br /><br />- What about today’s working environment makes mindfulness necessary?<br /><br />- What new vocabulary and methodology do we need to develop to meet our changing circumstances?<br /><br />- Is productivity what we should really care about anyway?<br /><br />Mindfulness and Stress Reduction with Daniel Goleman, best-selling author of Emotional Intelligence.

While under considerable pressure from his publisher to make a change, Ball insisted on keeping the leading character in his novel a black man. Ball made the right decision and the book garnered him much praise for progressive thinking and a keen understanding of racial prejudice. Ball wrote other books that featured the hero of In the Heat of the Night, detective Virgil Tibbs, including The Cool Cottontail (1966), and Johnny Get Your Gun (1969). Later in life, Ball worked as a part-time police offer in Los Angeles and also trained in the martial arts.

Drawing on stories of leaders as diverse as AG Lafley of Procter &amp; Gamble, Meg Whitman of eBay, Victoria Hale of the Institute for One World Health, and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys, Martin shows how integrative thinkers are relentlessly diagnosing and synthesizing by asking probing questions—including “What are the causal relationships at work here?” and “What are the implied trade-offs?” <br /> </p><p>Martin also presents a model for strengthening your integrative thinking skills by drawing on different kinds of knowledge—including conceptual and experiential knowledge. <br /> </p><p>Integrative thinking can be learned, and <i>The Opposable Mind</i> helps you master this vital skill.</p>",3.74,227,Kindle Edition, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19370926-opposable-mind,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19370926-opposable-mind

Photographed by Bruce Buckley, the full-color images highlighted in this book show each skill in an easy-to-follow format, providing new and experienced 'crossers a valuable resource for learning the sport. ""'Skills Drills and Bellyaches' is an incredible addition to the cyclocross community,"" Powers says. ""The contents of this book are going to help you improve your cyclocross riding without doing any intervals, without any long rides, and without any rigorous training plans."" Powers added that learning the concepts and techniques explained in the book ""will be one of many steps in a long journey to becoming a cyclo-boss!"" If you have been racing 'cross for several seasons, you may ask yourself why you need a book teaching the fundamental skills of the sport. Schieken and Tille look at it like this: Every time you dismount from your bike you are either gaining or losing time on your competition. For instance, if you are a habitual stutter-stepper on remounts, this can cost you around one second each time you get back on your bike. If you are on a course that requires three remounts per lap and you do six laps in your race, that's 18 seconds wasted. Let's say you have similar issues on the dismount. Same math, 18 seconds lost. You are now 36 seconds behind a competitor who is equally fit, but gets on and off the bike more proficiently. Even if you have years of 'cross racing under your bibshorts, you can always make improvements to your game. What is discussed in this new book helps show you the way.

  <b>They all thought he was gone. But he was alive and trapped inside his own body for ten years.</b>
</p><br /><p>In January 1988 Martin Pistorius, aged twelve, fell inexplicably sick. First he lost his voice and stopped eating. Then he slept constantly and shunned human contact. Doctors were mystified. Within eighteen months he was mute and wheelchair-bound. Martin's parents were told an unknown degenerative disease left him with the mind of a baby and less than two years to live.</p><br /><p>Martin was moved to care centers for severely disabled children. The stress and heartache shook his parents’ marriage and their family to the core. Their boy was gone. Or so they thought.</p><br /><p><i>Ghost Boy </i>is the heart-wrenching story of one boy’s return to life through the power of love and faith. In these pages, readers see a parent’s resilience, the consequences of misdiagnosis, abuse at the hands of cruel caretakers, and the unthinkable duration of Martin’s mental alertness betrayed by his lifeless body.</p><br /><p>We also see a life reclaimed—a business created, a new love kindled—all from a wheelchair. Martin's emergence from his own darkness invites us to celebrate our own lives and fight for a better life for others.</p>",4.01,286,Kindle Edition, ,310,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19394829-ghost-boy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19394829-ghost-boy

Or of the cold beef eaten by Willoughby on his journey of repentance to see Marianne?<br /><br />Why is it so appropriate that the scene of Emma's disgrace should be a picnic, and how do the different styles of housekeeping in Mansfield Park relate to the social issues of the day?<br /><br />While Jane Austen does not luxuriate in cataloguing meals in the way of Victorian novelists, food in fact plays a vital part in her novels.<br /><br />Her mainly domestic plots are deeply imbued with the rituals of giving and sharing meals. The attitudes of her characters to eating, to housekeeping and to hospitality are important indicators of their moral worth. This culminates in the artistic triumph of Emma, in which repeated references to food not only contribute to the portrait of her world, but provide an extended metaphor for the interdependence of a community.<br /><br />In this original, lively and well-researched book, Maggie Lane not only offers a fresh perspective on the novels of Jane Austen, but illuminates a fascinating period of food history, as England stood on the brink of urbanisation, middle-class luxury, and a revolution in the role of women.<br /><br />Ranging over topics from greed to gender to mealtimes and manners, and drawing on the novels, letters and Austen family papers, she also discusses Jane Austen's own ambivalent attitude to the provision and enjoyment of food.<br /><br />'Jane Austen And Food' is a brilliant and original study of one of England's greatest novelists and will fascinate her many fans.<br /><br />'This book will enrich our interpretation of Jane Austen's fiction, for Ms Lane makes us look afresh at the use of food as symbol and metaphor.’ Jane Austen Society Newsletter<br /><br />Maggie Lane is the author of many books on Jane Austen including 'Jane Austen's Family', 'Jane Austen's England', 'Jane Austen and Names', 'Understanding Austen' and the forthcoming 'Growing Older with Jane Austen'.

XX europeo y desembocará en una de las autocracias más destructivas de la historia de la humanidad</b>.<br /><br />La Revolución Rusa es uno de los acontecimientos más importantes del S. XX en Europa porque supone la creación del primer gobierno socialista en el mundo y antecede a la creación de la URSS y al cruel gobierno de Stalin, dos hechos sin los cuales, no se puede dar cuenta de la historia mundial del S. XX. Breve Historia de la Revolución Rusa nos presenta este conflicto de un modo claro que no renuncia, sin embargo, a explicar detalladamente no sólo los procesos que llevaron a la creación de la URSS sino las distintas ambiciones de los agentes implicados en tales procesos. Desde una perspectiva imparcial veremos las injusticias y las traiciones cometidas tanto por el zar Nicolás II como por los ejecutores de la revolución.<br /><br />Comienza Íñigo Bolinaga analizando la situación del Imperio ruso bajo el régimen despótico del zar Nicolás II, ajeno a la miseria del campesinado ruso muy atrasado con respecto al resto de Europa. No nos puede extrañar que tras la revolución frustrada de 1905, los burgueses le alzaran en el 17 y derrocaran al zar sin problemas, sin embargo, la debilidad del gobierno provisional hizo que tuviera que recurrir a los bolcheviques que no querían desaprovechar la oportunidad de obtener el gobierno ruso. Tras ganar al Ejército blanco que contaba con la ayuda de EEUU, Francia e Inglaterra, el Ejército rojo bolchevique instaura un gobierno socialista y crea la URSS que engloba los dispares territorios que antes administrara el imperio.<br /><br />El nuevo gobierno no será ajeno a las conspiraciones y traiciones y, en la última parte del libro se analizan los hechos que llevaron al sucesor menos capacitado de todos los aspirantes al gobierno de la URSS, Stalin, al poder. Analizará Íñigo Bolinaga los distintos subterfugios por los que Stalin se irá librando de toda oposición, incluyendo a sus aliados iniciales e incluso a la propia mujer de Lenin. Esta criba ideológica no tendrá fin y concluirá en una de las autocracias más terroríficas de la historia.<br /><br />Razones para comprar la obra:<br /><br />- La obra aclara no sólo la Revolución Rusa, también todos los procesos ideológicos y políticos que llevaron a la creación de la URSS.<br /><br />- La Revolución Rusa estableció un régimen imprescindible para entender hechos tan relevantes del S. XX como la Segunda Guerra Mundial o la Guerra Fría.<br /><br />- El autor nos descubre hechos poco conocidos como la revolución anarquista independiente que se dio en Ucrania y que, tras varios intentos de asimilación por parte de los comunistas, fue aniquilada.<br /><br />- El autor narra los complejos procesos históricos con un estilo novelesco y en un lenguaje diáfano que ayuda a la asimilación de los contenidos.<br /><br />Entender las distintas facciones implicadas en la Revolución Rusa, la situación de Rusia bajo el imperio del zar o la actuación de personajes como Lenin, Trotski o Stalin en el gobierno de la URSS en fundamental para entender las complicadas pugnas ideológicas que convirtieron al S. XX en uno de los más convulsos de la historia de la humanidad.",3.96,272,Kindle Edition, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486469-breve-historia-de-la-revoluci-n-rusa,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19486469-breve-historia-de-la-revoluci-n-rusa

One can feel her innocence and precociousness by experiencing her world through her journal, which is both poignant and captivating.<br /><br />While on the surface it might seem that she had all the material possessions a girl could wish for, she often expressed an internal longing for growth on a more personal level. We can often catch glimpses of the woman we would later come to know through the subsequent story of her life at Grey Gardens. <br /><br />She reveals a very strong love and attachment for her mother, a passion for dance, and endures numerous bouts of illness, requiring days of confinement. Despite her fragile health, she is a good swimmer and tennis player and wins her share of tournaments. 1929 finds Edie becoming more and more aware of boys and falling in love with a particular East Hampton summer boy.<br /> <br />We see a somber event unfolding in one entry entitled, “A Death,” on the day her great grandmother passes away. For an eleven year old, her reflection on the woman’s life is memorable and touching. <br /><br />Parties at Grey Gardens are described in detail when all the guests have rolled up the carpet to dance and Little Edie’s idea of a splendid evening is stealing away to her mother’s room where she tries on all the coats and wraps. <br /><br />During the year, life passages happen on a routine basis and she is astute at recording them, either deaths of loved ones, or the birth of still another cousin, one whose name happens to be Jacqueline Bouvier.",4.02,176,Kindle Edition, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19499802-i-only-mark-the-hours-that-shine,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19499802-i-only-mark-the-hours-that-shine

The Rise of Modern Philosophy is the fascinating story of the emergence, from the early sixteenth to the early nineteenth century, of great ideas and intellectual systems that shaped modern thought. Kenny introduces us to some of the world's most original and influential thinkers, and shows us the way to an understanding of their famous works. The thinkers we meet include <br />René Descartes, traditionally seen as the founder of modern philosophy; the great British philosophers Hobbes, Locke, and Hume; and the towering figure of Immanuel Kant, who perhaps more than any other made philosophy what it is today. <br />In the first three chapters Kenny tells the story chronologically: his lively accessible narrative brings the philosophers to life and fills in the historical and intellectual background to their work. It is ideal as the first thing to read for someone new to the history of modern philosophy. In the seven chapters that follow Kenny looks closely at each of the main areas of philosophical exploration in this period: knowledge and understanding; the nature of the physical universe; metaphysics <br />(the most fundamental questions there are about existence); mind and soul; the nature and content of morality; political philosophy; and God. <br />A selection of intriguing and beautiful illustrations offer a vivid evocation of the human and social side of philosophy.

Cold War veteran and CIA Operations Director Thomas Stansfield knows he must prepare his people for the next war. The rise of Islamic terrorism is coming, and it needs to be met abroad before it reaches America’s shores. Stansfield directs his protégée, Irene Kennedy, and his old Cold War colleague, Stan Hurley, to form a new group of clandestine operatives who will work outside the normal chain of command—men who do not exist.<br /><br />What type of man is willing to kill for his country without putting on a uniform?

Rapp starts in Istanbul, where he assassinates the Turkish arms dealer who sold the explosives used in the Pan Am attack. Rapp then moves onto Hamburg with his team and across Europe, leaving a trail of bodies. All roads lead to Beirut, though, and what Rapp doesn’t know is that the enemy is aware of his existence and has prepared a trap. The hunter is about to become the hunted, and Rapp will need every ounce of skill and cunning if he is to survive the war-ravaged city and its various terrorist factions.<br /><br />As action-packed, fast-paced, and brutally realistic as it gets, Flynn’s latest page-turner shows readers how it all began.

""There is a balm in Gilead,"" his neighbor Clara Morrow reads from the dust jacket, ""to make the wounded whole.""<br /><br />While Gamache doesn’t talk about his wounds and his balm, Clara tells him about hers. Peter, her artist husband, has failed to come home. Failed to show up as promised on the first anniversary of their separation. She wants Gamache’s help to find him. Having finally found sanctuary, Gamache feels a near revulsion at the thought of leaving Three Pines.

  <strong>A War Zone of the Soul</strong>
</p><br /><p>Dr. W. Lee Warren’s life as a neurosurgeon in a trauma center began to unravel long before he shipped off to serve the Air Force in Iraq in 2004. When he traded a comfortable if demanding practice in San Antonio, Texas, for a ride on a C-130 into the combat zone, he was already reeling from months of personal struggle.</p><br /><p>At the 332nd Air Force Theater Hospital at Joint Base Balad, Iraq, Warren realized his experience with trauma was just beginning. In his 120 days in a tent hospital, he was trained in a different specialty—surviving over a hundred mortar attacks and trying desperately to repair the damages of a war that raged around every detail of every day. No place was safe, and the constant barrage wore down every possible defense, physical or psychological.</p><br /><p>One day, clad only in a T-shirt, gym shorts, and running shoes, Warren was caught in the open while round after round of mortars shook the earth and shattered the air with their explosions, stripping him of everything he had been trying so desperately to hold on to.</p><br /><p>Warren’s story is an example of how a person can go from a place of total loss to one of strength, courage, and victory. Whether you are in the midst of your own crisis of faith, failed relationship, financial struggle, or illness, you will be inspired to remember that how you respond determines whether you survive—spiritually, emotionally, and sometimes physically.</p><br /><p>It is the beginning of a long journey home.</p>",4.42,331,Kindle Edition, ,86,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19631029-no-place-to-hide,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19631029-no-place-to-hide

As they confront an array of common catastrophes—a colicky baby, a faltering marriage, stalled ambitions—the wife analyzes her predicament, invoking everything from Keats and Kafka to the thought experiments of the Stoics to the lessons of doomed Russian cosmonauts. She muses on the consuming, capacious experience of maternal love, and the near total destruction of the self that ensues from it as she confronts the friction between domestic life and the seductions and demands of art.<br /><br /> With cool precision, in language that shimmers with rage and wit and fierce longing, Jenny Offill has crafted an exquisitely suspenseful love story that has the velocity of a train hurtling through the night at top speed.

Believing Abraham's unreserved obedience to be the essential leap of faith needed to make a full commitment to his religion, Kierkegaard himself made great sacrifices in order to dedicate his life entirely to his philosophy and to God. The conviction shown in this religious polemic - that a man can have an exceptional mission in life - informed all Kierkegaard's later writings, and was also hugely influential for both Protestant theology and the existentialist movement.<br /><br />Alastair Hannay's introduction elucidates Kierkegaard's philosophy and the ways in which it conflicted with more accepted contemporary views.

Before becoming a princess, she was merely a maid who washed dishes by day and by night slept upon a bookshelf in the village library. But now, she is heir to a throne and has her own servants. She expected neither wealth nor pomp in this life. Never hoped to find a prince who longed to find her. Never even believed a happily ever after was possible. She should have trusted her instincts. For in the days after her wedding day, when life was to be settled, complete, dark clouds of war begin to blot out the sunrises that follow. When her new husband, the Captain of the Guard, is forced to leave her and go to battle, the annuls of his exploits are horrible, but even more terrifying is the day his letters stopped coming. And when the Castle Keep, which promised safety and protection, is burned to the ground, there is no one there to save Princess Constance, save Princess Constance herself. For those who have ever felt trapped, lost, belittled, abused, broken, and a prisoner of life, take heart, for it still could be worse.

In his brief and explosively creative life—he committed suicide a few years later at the age of thirty-seven—Van Gogh made us see the world in a new way.

  <b>In the second volume of the Southern Reach Trilogy, questions are answered, stakes are raised, and mysteries are deepened . . .<br /></b>
  <br />
</p><p>In <i>Annihilation</i>,<i> </i>Jeff VanderMeer introduced Area X—a remote and lush terrain mysteriously sequestered from civilization. This was the first volume of a projected trilogy; well in advance of publication, translation rights had already sold around the world and a major movie deal had been struck.<br />     Just months later, <i>Authority</i>, the second volume, is here. For thirty years, the only human engagement with Area X has taken the form of a series of expeditions monitored by a secret agency called the Southern Reach. After the disastrous twelfth expedition chronicled in <i>Annihilation</i>,<i> </i>the Southern Reach is in disarray, and John Rodriguez, aka “Control,” is the team’s newly appointed head. From a series of interrogations, a cache of hidden notes, and hours of profoundly troubling video footage, the secrets of Area X begin to reveal themselves—and what they expose pushes Control to confront disturbing truths about both himself and the agency he’s promised to serve. And the consequences will spread much further than that.<br />     The Southern Reach trilogy will conclude in fall 2014 with <i>Acceptance</i>.<br /></p>",3.52,353,Kindle Edition, ,324,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20410190-authority,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20410190-authority

Gallup presents the remarkable findings of its massive in-depth study of great managers those who excelled at turning each employee s talent into performance. <br />Companies compete to find and keep the best employees using pay, benefits, promotions, and training.

There, in St. Petersburg—the once-glittering capital of Peter the Great’s Russia—Nicola and Rob unearth a tale of love and sacrifice, of courage and redemption . . . an old story that seems personal and small, perhaps, against the greater backdrops of the Jacobite and Russian courts, but one that will forever change their lives.",4.08,544,Kindle Edition, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489790-the-firebird,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489790-the-firebird

He’s a curmudgeon—the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him “the bitter neighbor from hell.” But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn’t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time?<br /><br />Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove’s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul.

Even those who support a woman's right to an abortion often qualify their support by saying abortion is a ""bad thing,"" an ""agonizing decision,"" making the medical procedure so remote and radioactive that it takes it out of the world of the everyday, turning an act that is normal and necessary into something shameful and secretive.

Today there are three cats for every dog on the planet, and yet cats remain more mysterious, even to their most adoring owners. Unlike dogs, cats evolved as solitary hunters, and, while many have learned to live alongside humans and even feel affection for us, they still don’t quite “get us” the way dogs do, and perhaps they never will. But cats have rich emotional lives that we need to respect and understand if they are to thrive in our company. <br /><br />In <i>Cat Sense</i>, renowned anthrozoologist John Bradshaw takes us further into the mind of the domestic cat than ever before, using cutting-edge scientific research to dispel the myths and explain the true nature of our feline friends. Tracing the cat’s evolution from lone predator to domesticated companion, Bradshaw shows that although cats and humans have been living together for at least eight thousand years, cats remain independent, predatory, and wary of contact with their own kind, qualities that often clash with our modern lifestyles. Cats still have three out of four paws firmly planted in the wild, and within only a few generations can easily revert back to the independent way of life that was the exclusive preserve of their predecessors some 10,000 years ago. Cats are astonishingly flexible, and given the right environment they can adapt to a life of domesticity with their owners—but to continue do so, they will increasingly need our help. If we’re to live in harmony with our cats, Bradshaw explains, we first need to understand their inherited quirks: understanding their body language, keeping their environments—however small—sufficiently interesting, and becoming more proactive in managing both their natural hunting instincts and their relationships with other cats.<br /><br />A must-read for any cat lover, <i>Cat Sense</i> offers humane, penetrating insights about the domestic cat that challenge our most basic assumptions and promise to dramatically improve our pets’ lives—and ours.<br /><br />",3.53,336,Paperback, ,15,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20578527-cat-sense,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20578527-cat-sense

W. Norton  Company,eng,false,"<strong>Four years after his #1 bestseller <em>The Big Short</em>, Michael Lewis returns to Wall Street to report on a high-tech predator stalking the equity markets.</strong><br /><br /><em>Flash Boys</em> is about a small group of Wall Street guys who figure out that the U.S. stock market has been rigged for the benefit of insiders and that, post–financial crisis, the markets have become not more free but less, and more controlled by the big Wall Street banks. Working at different firms, they come to this realization separately; but after they discover one another, the flash boys band together and set out to reform the financial markets. This they do by creating an exchange in which high-frequency trading—source of the most intractable problems—will have no advantage whatsoever.<br /><br />The characters in <em>Flash Boys</em> are fabulous, each completely different from what you think of when you think “Wall Street guy.” Several have walked away from jobs in the financial sector that paid them millions of dollars a year. From their new vantage point they investigate the big banks, the world’s stock exchanges, and high-frequency trading firms as they have never been investigated, and expose the many strange new ways that Wall Street generates profits.<br /><br />The light that Lewis shines into the darkest corners of the financial world may not be good for your blood pressure, because if you have any contact with the market, even a retirement account, this story is happening to you. But in the end, <em>Flash Boys</em> is an uplifting read. Here are people who have somehow preserved a moral sense in an environment where you don’t get paid for that; they have perceived an institutionalized injustice and are willing to go to war to fix it.",4.14,288,Hardcover, ,1919,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20604826-flash-boys,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20604826-flash-boys

Her old encounters with overdrawn bank accounts and oversized ambitions in the big city have given way to a new set of challenges. The first essay, ""Matricide,"" opens without flinching:<br /><br /><i>People who weren't there like to say that my mother died at home surrounded by loving family. This is technically true, though it was just my brother and me and he was looking at Facebook and I was reading a profile of Hillary Clinton in the December 2009 issue of </i>Vogue<i>.</i><br /><i></i><br />Elsewhere, she carefully weighs the decision to have children—""I simply felt no calling to be a parent. As a role, as my role, it felt inauthentic and inorganic""—and finds a more fulfilling path as a court-appointed advocate for foster children. In other essays, she skewers the marriage-industrial complex and recounts a harrowing near-death experience following a sudden illness. Throughout, Daum pushes back against the false sentimentality and shrink-wrapped platitudes that surround so much of contemporary American experience and considers the unspeakable thoughts many of us harbor—that we might not love our parents enough, that ""life's pleasures"" sometimes feel more like chores, that life's ultimate lesson may be that we often learn nothing. <br /> But Daum also operates in a comic register. With perfect precision, she reveals the absurdities of the New Age search for the ""Best Possible Experience,"" champions the merits of cream-of mushroom-soup casserole, and gleefully recounts a quintessential ""only-in-L.A."" story of playing charades at a famous person's home.<br /> Combining the piercing insight of Joan Didion with humor reminiscent of Nora Ephron's, Daum dissects our culture's most dangerous illusions, blind spots, and sentimentalities while retaining her own joy and compassion. Through it all, she dramatizes the search for an authentic self in a world where achieving an identity is never simple and never complete.",3.75,256,Hardcover, ,629,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613724-the-unspeakable,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613724-the-unspeakable

In this book Lars Svendsen examines the nature of boredom, how it originated, its history, how and why it afflicts us, and why we cannot seem to overcome it by any act of will.A diverse and vague phenomenon, described as anything from ‘tame longing without any particular object’ (Schopenhauer), ‘a bestial and indefinable affliction’ (Dostoevsky), to ‘time’s invasion of your world system’ (Joseph Brodsky), boredom allows many interpretations. In exploring these, Lars Svendsen brings together observations from philosophy, literature, psychology, theology and popular culture, examining boredom’s pre-Romantic manifestations in medieval torpor, philosophies of the subject from Pascal to Nietzsche, and modern related concepts of alienation and transgression, taking in texts by Samuel Beckett, J. G. Ballard, Andy Warhol and many others.A witty and entertaining account that considers a serious issue, it will appeal to anyone who has ever felt bored, and wanted to know why.",3.85,192,Kindle Edition, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20638175-a-philosophy-of-boredom,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20638175-a-philosophy-of-boredom

I think it’s because you’re on the limit right from the beginning. It has more tragedy — mechanical tragedy, crashes, rolled tires — it’s a game of mistakes, it’s very much like a Shakespearean drama.” –Richard Fries<br /><br />Cyclocross has, in recent years, become the fastest growing form of cycling in the US, according to USA Cycling. And the elite racers, race promoters and the cycling industry all are in agreement that there’s no end in sight. But, until now, there hasn’t been a book written about cyclocross in the US: it’s past, present and future. There’ve been books on training for cyclocross, and Europe has their own ompendiums about their great racers, but no one in the US has taken it upon him or herself to write about the US greats, from Jeremy Powers to Katie Compton to the US Grand Prix of Cyclocross to the Cannondale-CyclocrossWorld team. This book looks at them all, from the greats who started to build the sport in the US in the 1970s to the juniors who are the greatest hope for the future of cyclocross. And throughout the pages are the stories of triumph, of defeat, of fun and of suffering. But through each of those stories, there is a deep-seated, almost manic, love for the sport and for what it means. Cyclocross isn’t road racing, it isn’t mountain biking, it’s an entity unto itself and with it comes a unique culture that Tim Johnson, one of the greats in the sport, laughingly described as “unscented flypaper.” As he explains: you don’t know what you’re getting into until you see it for yourself, and then you’re stuck.<br /><br />Welcome to American ‘cross.<br /><br />For a beer-drinking cowbell-ringing mud-slinging good time, look no further than cyclocross, or in this case, Mud, Snow and Cyclocross: How ‘Cross Took Over US Cycling.",3.48,179,Kindle Edition, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20641548-mud-snow-and-cyclocross,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20641548-mud-snow-and-cyclocross

Jonathan Eig's masterful narrative revolves around four principal characters: the fiery feminist Margaret Sanger, who was a champion of birth control in her campaign for the rights of women but neglected her own children in pursuit of free love; the beautiful Katharine McCormick, who owed her fortune to her wealthy husband, the son of the founder of International Harvester and a schizophrenic; the visionary scientist Gregory Pincus, who was dismissed by Harvard in the 1930s as a result of his experimentation with <em>in vitro</em> fertilization but who, after he was approached by Sanger and McCormick, grew obsessed with the idea of inventing a drug that could stop ovulation; and the telegenic John Rock, a Catholic doctor from Boston who battled his own church to become an enormously effective advocate in the effort to win public approval for the drug that would be marketed by Searle as Enovid.<br /><br /><br />Spanning the years from Sanger’s heady Greenwich Village days in the early twentieth century to trial tests in Puerto Rico in the 1950s to the cusp of the sexual revolution in the 1960s, this is a grand story of radical feminist politics, scientific ingenuity, establishment opposition, and, ultimately, a sea change in social attitudes.

Midnight in Siberia chronicles David Greene's journey on the Trans-Siberian Railway, a 6,000-mile cross-country trip from Moscow to the Pacific port of Vladivostok. In quadruple-bunked cabins and stopover towns sprinkled across the country s snowy landscape, Greene speaks with ordinary Russians about how their lives have changed in the post-Soviet years.<br /><br />These travels offer a glimpse of the new Russia a nation that boasts open elections and newfound prosperity but continues to endure oppression, corruption, a dwindling population, and stark inequality.<br /><br />We follow Greene as he finds opportunity and hardship embodied in his fellow train travelers and in conversations with residents of towns throughout Siberia.<br /><br />We meet Svetlana, an entrepreneur who runs a small hotel in Ishim, fighting through corrupt layers of bureaucracy every day. Greene spends a joyous evening with a group of babushkas who made international headlines as runners-up at the Eurovision singing competition. They sing Beatles covers, alongside their traditional songs, finding that music and companionship can heal wounds from the past. In Novosibirsk, Greene has tea with Alexei, who runs the carpet company his mother began after the Soviet collapse and has mixed feelings about a government in which his family has done quite well. And in Chelyabinsk, a hunt for space debris after a meteorite landing leads Greene to a young man orphaned as a teenager, forced into military service, and now figuring out if any of his dreams are possible.<br /><br />Midnight in Siberia is a lively travel narrative filled with humor, adventure, and insight.

In Zaragoza, Spain, a ""citizen card"" can get you on the free city-wide Wi-Fi network, unlock a bike share, check a book out of the library, and pay for your bus ride home.

Others may fear deleterious side-effects or interactions with psychiatric drugs their clients are already taking. Even more pervasive is the safety concern that their clients may inappropriately experiment with these treatments in lieu of more potent and, sometimes, necessary conventional care.<br /><br /><br /><br />This book addresses all these common concerns and more when it comes to treating anxiety and depression, providing an essential framework for understanding holistic care and helping to make sense of the alternative solutions available.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bongiorno, a naturopath who regularly works with mental health clients, walks readers through the fundamentals, laying out the basic principles of holistic care, the most salient CAM research to date as well as its safety concerns, and steps to take to determine if it’s appropriate to introduce a CAM modality to your client’s treatment. He also explains when holistic approaches may not be appropriate.<br /><br /><br /><br />Readers are then taught how to assess lifestyle and physiological factors that can contribute to a client’s anxiety and depression, such as sleep, diet, caffeine intake, exercise, sunlight exposure, media use, low blood sugar, cholesterol levels, thyroid issues, hormone issues, digestive health, and more.<br /><br /><br /><br />With an understanding of these underlying factors in place, the book goes on to outline the most effective vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and mind-body therapies for anxiety and depression—from amino acids to zinc, acupuncture to Qi gong, and everything in between—including dosages, best applications, and contraindications. How to work integratively when a client is already on an anxiolytic or antidepressant is also covered.

Without you, there is no us. It is a chilling scene, but gradually Suki Kim, too, learns the tune and, without noticing, begins to hum it. It is 2011, and all universities in North Korea have been shut down for an entire year, the students sent to construction fields - except for the 270 students at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on impassively from the walls of every room, and where Suki has accepted a job teaching English. Over the next six months, she will eat three meals a day with her young charges and struggle to teach them to write, all under the watchful eye of the regime. <br /><br />Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic, especially for Suki, whose letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only from her minders but from her colleagues - evangelical Christian missionaries who don't know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn't share their faith. She is mystified by how easily her students lie, unnerved by their obedience to the regime. To them, everything in North Korea is the best, the tallest, the most delicious, the envy of all nations. Still, she cannot help but love them - their boyish enthusiasm, their eagerness to please, the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished. <br /><br />As the weeks pass, she begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond their own - at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely and, more dangerously, at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country where defectors risk torture and execution. The students in turn offer Suki tantalizing glimpses into their lives, from their thoughts on how to impress girls to their disappointment that soccer games are only televised when the North Korean team wins. Then Kim Jong-il dies, leaving the students devastated, and leading Suki to question whether the gulf between her world and theirs can ever be bridged.<br /><br />Without You, There Is No Us offers a moving and incalculably rare glimpse of life in the world's most unknowable country, and at the privileged young men she calls ""soldiers and slaves.""",3.90,291,Hardcover, ,1783,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20685373-without-you-there-is-no-us,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20685373-without-you-there-is-no-us

In this groundbreaking study Roham Alvandi offers a revisionist account of the shah's relationship with the United States by examining the partnership he forged with Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. Based on extensive research in the British and U.S. archives, as well as a wealth of Persian-language diaries, memoirs, and oral histories, this work restores agency to the shah as an autonomous international actor and suggests that Iran evolved from a client to a partner of the United States under the Nixon Doctrine.<br /><br /><em>Nixon, Kissinger, and the Shah </em>offers a detailed account of three key historical episodes in the Nixon-Kissinger-Pahlavi partnership that shaped the global Cold War far beyond Iran's borders. It examines the emergence of Iranian primacy in the Persian Gulf as the Nixon administration looked to the shah to fill the vacuum created by the British withdrawal from the region in 1971. It then turns to the peak of the partnership after Nixon and Kissinger's historic 1972 visit to Iran, when the shah succeeded in drawing the United States into his covert war against Iraq in Kurdistan. Finally, it focuses on the decline of the partnership under Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, through a history of the failed negotiations from 1974 to 1976 for an agreement on U.S. nuclear exports to Iran. Taken together, these episodes map the rise of the fall of Iran's Cold War partnership with the United States during the decade of superpower detente, Vietnam, and Watergate.<br /><br />This work of American diplomatic history, international relations, and Middle Eastern Studies provides critical historic background on Iran's ambitions for primacy in the Persian Gulf, its nuclear program, and what a US-Iran strategic partnership might look like in the future.<br />",4.00,255,Hardcover, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20707653-nixon-kissinger-and-the-shah,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20707653-nixon-kissinger-and-the-shah

A collection of stories, thoughts, ideas, lists, and haiku from the mind of one of our most beloved entertainers, <em>Yes Please</em> offers Amy’s thoughts on everything from her “too safe” childhood outside of Boston to her early days in New York City, her ideas about Hollywood and “the biz,” the demon that looks back at all of us in the mirror, and her joy at being told she has a “face for wigs.” <em>Yes Please</em> is a chock-full of words and wisdom to live by.",3.83,231,ebook, ,838,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20764862-yes-please,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20764862-yes-please

William Burroughs, obsesionado con éste, aseguró que la frase era una contraseña mágica: «Se dice que un iniciado que desee conocer la respuesta a cualquier pregunta -aﬁrmó en una de sus obras- sólo necesita repetir estas palabras cuando se duerme y la respuesta llegará en un sueño». A comienzos de los años noventa, el escritor seguía considerando a Sabbah como uno de sus mentores. Su escandalosa vida y la radicalidad de toda su obra lo habían convertido en un símbolo para rebeldes y anarquistas, llegando a ser uno de los precursores ideológicos del movimiento punk. Entonces, el mundo se rendía ante Nirvana, considerada la última gran banda de rock and roll y Kurt Cobain, su cantante, el profeta de una nueva generación.<br /><br />Tras la muerte del cantante, ocultas entre cientos de páginas y cuadernos manuscritos, aparecieron cuatro hermosas fotografías en las que se le veía paseando en compañía de Burroughs. Cada una de las fotografías, hasta entonces desconocidas, contaban su propia historia. También encerraban un misterio. Habían sido tomadas en octubre de 1993, cuando Cobain cumplió su gran sueño: visitar a Burroughs, su mayor héroe y una de sus más importantes inﬂuencias.<br /><br />En Nada es verdad, todo está permitido. El día que Kurt Cobain conoció a William Burroughs, desﬁlan viejos cantantes de blues como Son House, Robert Johnson o Skip James, junto a la permanente sombra del gran Leadbelly, el legendario ladrón Jack Black, la historia del forajido William Quantrill o la ﬁgura de los falsos predicadores. El libro es un recorrido por una parte importante del siglo veinte, centrándose en las conexiones entre dos de sus principales héroes (Burroughs y Cobain) e indagando en la relación entre música y subversión, arte y rebelión. En sus páginas, escritores outsiders, músicos y artistas oscuros, comparten un mismo fuego y bailan en torno a la ﬁgura de Burroughs, quien parece hablarles, como si fuesen ellos los destinatarios de la dedicatoria incluida en Ciudades de la noche roja: «A todos los escribas y artistas y practicantes de la magia a través de los cuales se han manifestado estos espectros...

Interwoven with themes of brutality and faith, guilt and fear, helplessness and survival, the characters in these stories struggle to make meaning out of chaos. <br /><br />In ""Redeployment"", a soldier who has had to shoot dogs because they were eating human corpses must learn what it is like to return to domestic life in suburbia, surrounded by people ""who have no idea where Fallujah is, where three members of your platoon died."" In ""After Action Report"", a Lance Corporal seeks expiation for a killing he didn't commit, in order that his best friend will be unburdened. A Morturary Affairs Marine tells about his experiences collecting remains - of U.S. and Iraqi soldiers both. A chaplain sees his understanding of Christianity, and his ability to provide solace through religion, tested by the actions of a ferocious Colonel. And in the darkly comic ""Money as a Weapons System"", a young Foreign Service Officer is given the absurd task of helping Iraqis improve their lives by teaching them to play baseball. These stories reveal the intricate combination of monotony, bureaucracy, comradeship and violence that make up a soldier's daily life at war, and the isolation, remorse, and despair that can accompany a soldier's homecoming. <br /><br />Redeployment is poised to become a classic in the tradition of war writing. Across nations and continents, Klay sets in devastating relief the two worlds a soldier inhabits: one of extremes and one of loss. Written with a hard-eyed realism and stunning emotional depth, this work marks Phil Klay as one of the most talented new voices of his generation.",3.97,304,Kindle Edition, ,103,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20799196-redeployment,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20799196-redeployment

Drawing on his experience as one of the foremost statesmen of the modern era—advising presidents, traveling the world, observing and shaping the central foreign policy events of recent decades—Kissinger now reveals his analysis of the ultimate challenge for the twenty-first century: how to build a shared international order in a world of divergent historical perspectives, violent conflict, proliferating technology, and ideological extremism.<br /><br />There has never been a true “world order,” Kissinger observes. For most of history, civilizations defined their own concepts of order. Each considered itself the center of the world and envisioned its distinct principles as universally relevant. China conceived of a global cultural hierarchy with the Emperor at its pinnacle. In Europe, Rome imagined itself surrounded by barbarians; when Rome fragmented, European peoples refined a concept of an equilibrium of sovereign states and sought to export it across the world. Islam, in its early centuries, considered itself the world’s sole legitimate political unit, destined to expand indefinitely until the world was brought into harmony by religious principles. The United States was born of a conviction about the universal applicability of democracy—a conviction that has guided its policies ever since.<br /><br />Now international affairs take place on a global basis, and these historical concepts of world order are meeting. Every region participates in questions of high policy in every other, often instantaneously. Yet there is no consensus among the major actors about the rules and limits guiding this process, or its ultimate destination. The result is mounting tension.<br /><br />Grounded in Kissinger’s deep study of history and his experience as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, <i>World Order</i> guides readers through crucial episodes in recent world history. Kissinger offers a unique glimpse into the inner deliberations of the Nixon administration’s negotiations with Hanoi over the end of the Vietnam War, as well as Ronald Reagan’s tense debates with Soviet Premier Gorbachev in Reykjavík. He offers compelling insights into the future of U.S.–China relations and the evolution of the European Union, and examines lessons of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Taking readers from his analysis of nuclear negotiations with Iran through the West’s response to the Arab Spring and tensions with Russia over Ukraine, <i>World Order</i> anchors Kissinger’s historical analysis in the decisive events of our time.<br /><br />Provocative and articulate, blending historical insight with geopolitical prognostication, <i>World Order</i> is a unique work that could come only from a lifelong policymaker and diplomat.",4.06,420,Hardcover, ,648,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821140-world-order,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821140-world-order

When the old world is unexpectedly brought down in a total war, the band seizes control of the country, and the new regime it founds as the vanguard of a new world order is ruthlessly dominated from within by the former seminarian until he stands as the absolute ruler of a vast and terrible state apparatus, with dominion over Eurasia. But the largest country in the world is also a poor and backward one, far behind the great capitalist countries in industrial and military power, encircled on all sides. Shortly after seizing total power, Stalin conceives of the largest program of social reengineering ever attempted: the root-and-branch uprooting and collectivization of agriculture and industry across the entire Soviet Union. To stand up to the capitalists he will force into being an industrialized, militarized, collectivized great power is an act of will. Millions will die, and many more will suffer, but Stalin will push through to the end against all resistance and doubts. Where did such power come from? We think we know the story well. Remarkably, Stephen Kotkin’s epic new biography shows us how much we still have to learn.<br /><br /> The product of a decade of scrupulous and intrepid research, <i>Stalin</i> contains a host of astonishing revelations. Kotkin gives an intimate first-ever view of the Bolshevik regime’s inner geography, bringing to the fore materials from Soviet military intelligence and the secret police. He details Stalin’s invention of a fabricated trial and mass executions as early as 1918, the technique he would later impose across the whole country. The book places Stalin’s momentous decision for collectivization more deeply than ever in the tragic history of imperial Russia. Above all, Kotkin offers a convincing portrait and explanation of Stalin’s monstrous power and of Russian power in the world. <i>Stalin</i> restores a sense of surprise to the way we think about the former Soviet Union, revolution, dictatorship, the twentieth century, and indeed the art of history itself.<br />",3.82,976,Hardcover, ,152,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821221-stalin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821221-stalin

How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? <br /><br />In <i>Sapiens</i>, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors?

Now you can see exactly how it was done, so you can get that exact same look every time.<br /><br />In these extra pages, each spread allows you to dig in a little deeper and really unlock the power of these recipes. Scott breaks each spread into four segments: (1) he explains exactly what you're seeing behind the scenes, (2) he lists all of his camera settings, and lens and lighting info--it's all there, (3) he gives you his thought process, so you learn exactly why he does it this way, and (4) he shares all the post-processing in Lightroom or Photoshop that goes on after the shoot (this is something other books leave out). Plus, the whole book is packed with tips and insights you won't find anywhere else.<br /><br />This isn't a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed concepts.

It isn't easy returning to civilian life, especially burdened as he is with a staggering case of PTSD or hunted as he is by an enemy determined to seek an eye-for-eye--neither of which can he battle until he confronts the truth of what happened one fateful day in the high mountain ranges of the Hindu Kush. <br /> <br />. . .

A recent eBay auction for the only known copy of a particular record topped out at $37,100.

Throughout this history, potters, sculptors, painters, poets, novelists, cartoonists, song-writers, photographers and film-makers have been there to record and make sense of it all. In her encyclopaedic investigation of the shifting social, political and cultural resonances of this most visceral of sports, Kasia Boddy throws new light on an elemental struggle for dominance whose weapons are nothing more than fists. From Daniel Mendoza to Mike Tyson, boxers have embodied and enacted our anxieties about race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality. Looking afresh at everything from neo-classical sculpture to hip-hop lyrics, Boddy explores the way in which the history of boxing has intersected with the history of mass media, and sheds new light on the work of such diverse figures as Henry Fielding and Spike Lee, Charlie Chaplin and Philip Roth, James Joyce and Mae West, Bertolt Brecht and Charles Dickens.

She has no choice if she's going to clear her father's name and recover the missing relic before <br />the impending summer solstice. <br />What's at stake? Just the end of the world as Kyra knows it. <br />From the author of ""Blackwood ""comes a fresh, thrilling urban fantasy that will appeal to fans of Neil Gaiman, Cassandra Clare, and Rick Riordan... <br />""<br />""",3.42,416,Paperback, ,104,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21030057-the-woken-gods,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21030057-the-woken-gods

Wegner (1914-2007) is inseparable from his unrivalled chairs, which have helped Danish design achieve international recognition. Any fan of design has his or her favorite among Wegner's approximately 500 creations, and there is hardly an interior design magazine that has not included an illustration of his elegant China Chair (1943) or Y Chair (1950). Even John F. Kennedy sat on the Round Chair, now known simply as The Chair (1949). Trained as a furniture maker, Wegner typically made his prototypes by hand, using traditional joinery techniques such as tongue-and-groove or finger joints. In the process, he often pushed the limitations of wood, giving his designs an unequaled elegance. Their beauty was matched by their practicality: he considered comfort and ergonomics to be equally as important as appearance. Despite his concern for functionality, his personality and sense of humor also shone through his works, as evidenced by his splendid Peacock Chair (1947) or the masculine Ox Chair (1960), available with or without horns.",4.44,256,Hardcover, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21039048-wegner,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21039048-wegner

Based in the latest research in neuroscience, this audiobook offers dozens of little things you can do every day to rewire your brain and create an upward spiral towards a happier, healthier life.</b><br /><br />Depression doesn't happen all at once. It starts gradually and builds momentum over time. If you go through a difficult experience, you may stop taking care of yourself. You may stop exercising and eating healthy, which will end up making you feel even worse as time goes on. You are caught in a downward spiral, but you may feel too tired, too overwhelmed, and too scared to try and pull yourself back up. The good news is that just one small step can be a step in the right direction.<br /><br />In <i>The Upward Spiral</i>, neuroscientist Alex Korb demystifies the neurological processes in the brain that cause depression and offers effective ways to get better ""one little step at a time"". In the book, you'll discover that there isn't ""one big solution"" that will solve your depression. Instead, there are dozens of small, practical things you can do to alleviate your symptoms and start healing. Some are as simple as relaxing certain muscles to reduce feelings of anxiety, while others involve making small efforts toward more positive social interactions. Small steps in the right direction can have profound effects giving you the power to literally ""reshape"" your brain.<br /><br />Like most people, you probably didn't wake up one day and find yourself completely depressed. Instead, it probably happened over time, as a series of reactions to difficult situations and negative thinking. But if you are ready to reverse the trajectory of your depression and find lasting happiness, this book will show you how.",4.26,240,Paperback, ,227,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413760-the-upward-spiral,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413760-the-upward-spiral

The death is dismissed as a wolf attack, but Maija feels certain that the wounds could only have been inflicted by another man. Compelled to investigate despite her neighbors' strange disinterest in the death and the fate of Eriksson's widow, Maija is drawn into the dark history of tragedies and betrayals that have taken place on Blackåsen.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.<br /><br />We all have a voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It’s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it’s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.<br /><br /><em>10% Happier</em> takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.",3.92,256,Kindle Edition, ,372,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21419710-10-happier,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21419710-10-happier

Con treinta y seis años, Nicolás Boullosa no se siente en el albor de ninguna crisis de la mediana edad. Tampoco hay rastro de despecho existencial. <br /> <br />Nicolás Boullosa no quiere nada de nadie ni culpa a nadie de nada. La vida le trata bien y no está indignado. No ha acudido en los últimos años a ninguna manifestación del 15M, ni a concentración alguna de los partidarios o contrarios a la independencia de Cataluña. <br /> <br />Nicolás Boullosa cree llevar una existencia plena, con un propósito cuantificable y puesto a prueba a diario. Trabaja duro en la web que ha fundado desde casa y escribe narrativa en los ratos libres que se gana a pulso. Su oficina es su centro de retiro voluntario, lejos del pancartismo y los achaques victimistas. <br /> <br />Percibe la última década, la del umbral de la madurez, como el mejor tercio de su existencia. Comparte proyecto profesional con su mujer, videógrafa estadounidense y madre de sus tres hijos. <br /> <br />Sabe a qué juega y con qué herramientas. Ha elegido su propio camino, no ha recibido nunca una subvención ni mucho menos usado la influencia de otros para lograr su cometido. Ha leído en los clásicos que la única exigencia inaplazable es no engañarse a uno mismo: como un libertario ácrata del siglo XIX, Nicolás Boullosa quiere ser mejor cada momento, depender lo mínimo de terceros para cumplir con sus retos cotidianos... <br /> <br />Justo ahora, cuando cree haber encontrado en la voluntad racional individual el camino para autorrealizarse, la esfera colectiva contraataca, exigiendo al ciudadano con escrúpulos a que se posicione en algún extremo y apoye, así, alguna cruzada. <br /> <br />Ha pasado un lustro desde el inicio de la crisis; el malestar y los extremismos colectivos enarbolan las viejas banderas idealistas. Construcciones etéreas y con esencia platónica como la Provicencia o el Pueblo desempolvan viejas consignas y todo el mundo parece ser independentista de algo, antimonárquico, revolucionario de algo otro, refundador de lo de más allá. <br /> <br />La cotidianidad de Nicolás Boullosa revive la gran batalla de todos los tiempos: aristotélicos contra platónicos; razón contra misticismo; paciencia, perseverancia, propósito personal, autosuficiencia y libre albedrío contra misiones colectivas de ""sacrificio"", ""solidaridad"" y ""misericordia"" a favor de la ""causa"", el ""proceso"" o la ""misión"", expresiones que -cree- propulsan el populismo y le causan arcadas. <br /> <br />Desde su oficina doméstica, Nicolás Boullosa busca una temática para su segunda novela, después de que la primera, autopublicada en la tienda de Amazon, pasara desapercibida. Mientras afronta con el sudor frío del escritor principiante el síndrome de la página en blanco, alguien pica a la puerta. <br /> <br />El extraño visitante se declara ""lector"" de su primer libro. Percibe entonces que el extraño tiene la potestad de cambiar su existencia, poniendo en riesgo la tranquilidad que nadie le ha regalado... Hasta que el riesgo se convierte en enseñanza. Oportunidad. <br /> <br />La rebelión del charna es un viaje por la transitoriedad de la existencia, complemento filosófico contemporáneo del primer libro del autor (Triskelion, una novela histórica donde se combinan los orígenes de su propia vida en un pasado remoto y el germen de la Ilustración).",5.00,308,Kindle Edition, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425229-la-rebeli-n-del-charna,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425229-la-rebeli-n-del-charna

I was not born to be defined by someone else, but by myself, and myself only.” When, in the fall of 1987, the poet Quincy Troupe traveled to the south of France to interview James Baldwin, Baldwin’s brother David told him to ask Baldwin about everything—Baldwin was critically ill and David knew that this might be the writer’s last chance to speak at length about his life and work.<br /><br />The result is one of the most eloquent and revelatory interviews of Baldwin’s career, a conversation that ranges widely over such topics as his childhood in Harlem, his close friendship with Miles Davis, his relationship with writers like Toni Morrison and Richard Wright, his years in France, and his ever-incisive thoughts on the history of race relations and the African-American experience.<br /><br />Also collected here are significant interviews from other moments in Baldwin’s life, including an in-depth interview conducted by Studs Terkel shortly after the publication of <i>Nobody Knows My Name</i>.

This was the crucial half-century of Rome's spectacular rise to imperial status, but Roman interest in its eastern neighbors began a little earlier, with the First Illyrian War of 229, and climaxed later with the infamous destruction of Corinth in 146. <br /> Taken at the Flood chronicles this momentous move by Rome into the Greek east. Until now, this period of history has been overshadowed by the threat of Carthage in the west, but events in the east were no less important in themselves, and Robin Waterfield's account reveals the peculiar nature of Rome's eastern policy. For over seventy years, the Romans avoided annexation so that they could commit their military and financial resources to the fight against Carthage and elsewhere. Though ultimately a failure, this policy of indirect rule, punctuated by periodic brutal military interventions and intense diplomacy, worked well for several decades, until the Senate finally settled on more direct forms of control. <br /> Waterfield's fast-paced narrative focuses mainly on military and diplomatic maneuvers, but throughout he interweaves other topics and themes, such as the influence of Greek culture on Rome, the Roman aristocratic ethos, and the clash between the two best fighting machines the ancient world ever produced: the Macedonian phalanx and Roman legion. The result is an absorbing account of a critical chapter in Rome's mastery of the Mediterranean.",3.84,320,Kindle Edition, ,15,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21517671-taken-at-the-flood,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21517671-taken-at-the-flood

Tres jóvenes españoles abandonan su anodina y predestinada existencia de provincias en busca de otro porvenir. Sus orígenes, cultura y valores difieren pero comparten, sin saberlo, el mismo anhelo: labrar su propio futuro lejos de su terruño. <br /><br />En la España de élites ilustradas y jansenistas de Carlos III, los tres muchachos identifican por distintos motivos una idéntica utopía geográfica: los confines de Nueva España, más allá de las Provincias Internas del altiplano septentrional mexicano. <br /><br />Un descendiente de hidalgos y conversos extremeños, un menestral catalán de Barcelona con orígenes pirenaicos y un seminarista de provincias gallego, se opondrán a lo que la rígida providencia ha planeado para ellos. Partirán primero hacia Cádiz para, desde allí, viajar hacia Nueva España con el salvoconducto de una compañía comercial barcelonesa. <br /><br />La casualidad unirá la empresa individual de los aventureros. A medida que conozcan los detalles de sus respectivas historias, acumularán certezas de que sus conocimientos y habilidades se complementan, como si alguien o algo se hubiera conjurado desde tiempos inmemoriales para encajar, ahora, su existencia. Solos, son meros buscavidas; unidos, sin embargo, constituyen la última esperanza para desentrañar el significado de un antiguo mensaje críptico. <br /><br />Parten de Cádiz con una misión común: localizar a fray Junípero Serra, la mayor eminencia del Imperio sobre la obra de Ramon Llull y, a la vez, un humilde misionero franciscano entregado a su tarea en los confines del remoto territorio de la California Nueva. Durante su viaje, entenderán a los Argonautas y a Odiseo. Tratarán de desentrañar el enigma viajando hacia él, para averiguar si el recorrido geográfico conduce al espiritual, y a la inversa. <br /><br />La empresa de los tres muchachos dará con uno de los textos más importantes jamás escritos, cuya belleza será aprovechada por Benjamin Franklin, padre fundador de Estados Unidos, para la mayor empresa jamás acometida.

Few people know of it: a broken web of ancient passageways and abandoned rooms. A young woman lives there, tucked among the sprawling tunnels of the Underthing, snug in the heart of this forgotten place.<br /><br />Her name is Auri, and she is full of mysteries.<br /><br /><i>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</i> is a brief, bittersweet glimpse of Auri’s life, a small adventure all her own. At once joyous and haunting, this story offers a chance to see the world through Auri’s eyes. And it gives the reader a chance to learn things that only Auri knows...<br /><br />In this book, Patrick Rothfuss brings us into the world of one of <i>The Kingkiller Chronicle’s</i> most enigmatic characters.

The marketing people aren’t going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I’d rather be honest with you right out of the gate.<br /><br />First, if you haven’t read my other books, you don’t want to start here.<br /><br />My first two books are <i>The Name of the Wind</i> and <i>The Wise Man’s Fear</i>. If you’re curious to try my writing, start there. They’re the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you’re probably going to feel pretty lost.<br /><br />Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it’s only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don’t go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn’t do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you’re looking for a continuation of Kvothe’s storyline, you’re not going to find it here.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you’d like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you’re curious about the Underthing and alchemy.

Si su anterior obra, <i>Tierra desacostumbrada</i>, multiplicó el número de sus entusiastas lectores —fue considerado mejor libro de 2008 por <i>The New York Times</i> y se vendieron más de 700 mil ejemplares sólo en Estados Unidos—, esta nueva novela ha vuelto a concitar la admiración de la crítica y ha sido finalista del Premio Booker y del National Book Award. Con sus minuciosos retratos de emigrantes indios marcados por un abrupto choque cultural, que los aboca a un inevitable conflicto de identidad, Lahiri teje un delicado y complejo tapiz de las emociones humanas que fascina por su profundidad y carácter universal.<br /><br />Los hermanos Subhash y Udayan viven en un humilde barrio de Calcuta donde, durante la temporada de lluvias, un lecho seco entre dos lagunas se transforma en un gran espejo de agua.

How does a thing become mine? Liberal philosophy since John Locke has championed the salutary effects of private property but has avoided the more difficult questions of property's ontology.

In these antebellum texts, ownership is not an abstract legal form but a lived relation, a dynamic of embodiment emerging within specific cultural spaces--a disputed frontier, a city agitated by class conflict.<br /><br />Luck challenges accounts that map property practice along a trajectory of abstraction and ""virtualization."" The book also reorients recent Americanist work in emotion and affect by detailing a broader phenomenology of ownership, one extending beyond emotion to such sensory experiences as touch, taste, and vision.

Flavia being Flavia, a budding chemist and sleuth, that gift is a charred and mummified body, which tumbles out of a bedroom chimney. Now, while attending classes, making friends (and enemies), and assessing the school’s stern headmistress and faculty (one of whom is an acquitted murderess), Flavia is on the hunt for the victim’s identity and time of death, as well as suspects, motives, and means.

Combined, these factors are doing nothing less than overturning the global system and ushering in a new (dis)order. <br />For most, that is a disaster-in-waiting, but not for the Americans.

This is Krista Bremer’s accidental jihad.</strong> <br /><br />Fifteen years ago, she was a surfer from a secular middle-class family who dreamed of a comfortable American life of adventure, romance, and opportunity. Then, on a running trail in North Carolina, she met Ismail. Kind, sincere, and passionate, Ismail came from another world: one of eight children, he’d been raised in an impoverished fishing village in Libya. When Krista later realized she was carrying his child—and she and Ismail made the decision to become a family—she embarked on a journey she never could have imagined.<br /><br />Arriving in Libya to meet her relatives, Krista is engulfed by a tribe of extended family for whom faith informs every act, big or small. She discovers both overwhelming hospitality and unimaginable oppression as she spends her days within a circle of Muslim women who challenge her notions of femininity, freedom, and what it means to be family.<br /><br />In this unlikely love story, we see a marriage of opposites, watching Krista and Ismail negotiate unforeseen differences at every turn: when their daughter decides to don a head scarf; during Ismail’s monthlong fast of Ramadan; as Krista attempts to explain Christmas trees and Valentine’s Day gifts. In any marriage, we might discover that our mate is foreign to us, with vastly different memories and assumptions about home,family, and the world. Krista learns to embrace the differences, both intellectually and emotionally, and on the way finds the meaning of true intimacy.<br /><br />Fascinating, profoundly moving, and enlightening, <em>My Accidental Jihad</em> explores what it means to open one’s mind to another culture—and just as important, to open one’s heart.</p>",3.50,304,Kindle Edition, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21936329-my-accidental-jihad,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21936329-my-accidental-jihad

Fans of Paula Hawkins’ <em>The Girl on the Train</em> will love this modern reimagining of Patricia Highsmith’s classic <em>Strangers on a Train</em> from the author of the acclaimed <em>The Girl with a Clock for a Heart</em>—which the <em>Washington Post</em> said “should be a contender for crime fiction’s best first novel of 2014.”<br /><br />On a night flight from London to Boston, Ted Severson meets the stunning and mysterious Lily Kintner. Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him. Ted and his wife were a mismatch from the start—he the rich businessman, she the artistic free spirit—a contrast that once inflamed their passion, but has now become a cliché.<br /><br />But their game turns a little darker when Ted jokes that he could kill Miranda for what she’s done. Lily, without missing a beat, says calmly, “I’d like to help.” After all, some people are the kind worth killing, like a lying, stinking, cheating spouse. . . .<br /><br />Back in Boston, Ted and Lily’s twisted bond grows stronger as they begin to plot Miranda's demise. But there are a few things about Lily’s past that she hasn’t shared with Ted, namely her experience in the art and craft of murder, a journey that began in her very precocious youth.<br /><br />Suddenly these co-conspirators are embroiled in a chilling game of cat-and-mouse, one they both cannot survive . . . with a shrewd and very determined detective on their tail.",4.03,311,Hardcover, ,7869,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21936809-the-kind-worth-killing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21936809-the-kind-worth-killing

Almost four years after the war’s end, the city is still in ruins, a physical wasteland and a political symbol about to rupture. In the West, a defiant, blockaded city is barely surviving on airlifted supplies; in the East, the heady early days of political reconstruction are being undermined by the murky compromises of the Cold War. Espionage, like the black market, is a fact of life. Even culture has become a battleground, with German intellectuals being lured back from exile to add credibility to the competing sectors.<br /><br />Alex Meier, a young Jewish writer, fled the Nazis for America before the war. But the politics of his youth have now put him in the cross-hairs of the McCarthy witch-hunts. Faced with deportation and the loss of his family, he makes a desperate bargain with the fledgling CIA: he will earn his way back to America by acting as their agent in his native Berlin. But almost from the start things go fatally wrong. A kidnapping misfires, an East German agent is killed, and Alex finds himself a wanted man. Worse, he discovers his real assignment — to spy on the woman he left behind, the only woman he has ever loved. Changing sides in Berlin is as easy as crossing a sector border. But where do we draw the lines of our moral boundaries? At betrayal? Survival? Murder?<br /><br />Joseph Kanon’s compelling thriller is a love story that brilliantly brings a shadowy period of history vividly to life.",3.65,371,Paperback, ,717,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21943244-leaving-berlin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21943244-leaving-berlin
