The difference, though, between young Master Mole and his peers is that this British lad keeps a diary - an earnest chronicle of longing and disaster that has charmed more than five million readers since its two-volume initial publication. From teen-aged Adrian's anguished adoration of a lovely, mercurial schoolmate to his view of his parents' constantly creaking relationship to his heartfelt but hilarious attempts at cathartic verse, here is an outrageous triumph of deadpan - and deadly accurate - satire. ABBA, Princess Di's wedding, street punks, Monty Python, the Falklands campaign . . . all the cultural pageantry of a keenly observed era marches past the unique perspective of Sue Townsend's brilliant comic creation: A .

A correspondent for the <i>Toronto Star,</i> Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braque and Picasso were experimenting with cubist form; James Joyce, long living in self-imposed exile from his native Dublin, had just completed <i>Ulysses;</i> Gertrude Stein held court at 27 Rue de Fleurus, and deemed young Ernest a member of <i>une gneration perdue;</i> and T.S. Eliot was a bank clerk in London. It was during these years that the as-of-yet unpublished young writer gathered the material for his first novel <i>The Sun Also Rises,</i> and the subsequent masterpieces that followed.<br /><p>Among these small, reflective sketches are unforgettable encounters with the members of Hemingway's slightly rag-tag circle of artists and writers, some also fated to achieve fame and glory, others to fall into obscurity. Here, too, is an evocation of the Paris that Hemingway knew as a young man - a map drawn in his distinct prose of the streets and cafes and bookshops that comprised the city in which he, as a young writer, sometimes struggling against the cold and hunger of near poverty, honed the skills of his craft.<br /></p><p><i>A Moveable Feast</i> is at once an elegy to the remarkable group for expatriates that gathered in Paris during the twenties and a testament to the risks and rewards of the writerly life.</p>",4.03,206,Paperback, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115257.Par_s_era_una_fiesta,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115257.Par_s_era_una_fiesta

Four years before his death, Will Durant began work on an abbreviated version of his highly acclaimed eleven-volume series, ""The Story of Civilization."" The project was conceived as a series of audio lectures, but Durant soon realized that the dialogues could be developed into a book that would serve as a wonderfully readable introduction to the subject of history.<br /><br />Durant completed twenty-one of a proposed twenty-three chapters before his death in 1981, at the age of ninety-six. Those chapters span thousands of years of human history -- from Confucius to Shakespeare, from the Roman Empire to the Reformation, finally ending in the eighteenth century. The manuscript was recently found by Will Durant scholar John Little -- twenty years after Durant finished it -- and its discovery is a major event, not only for lovers of his prose, but for students of history and philosophy the world over.<br /><br />""Heroes of History"" is a book of life-enhancing wisdom and optimism, complete with Durant's wit, knowledge, and unique ability to explain events and ideas in simple, exciting terms. It is the lessons of our heritage passed on for the edification and benefit of future generations -- a fitting legacy from America's most beloved historian and philosopher.<br /><br />Will Durant's popularity as America's favorite teacher of history and philosophy remains undiminished by time. His books are accessible to readers of every kind, and his unique ability to compress complicated ideas and events into a few pages without ever ""talking down"" to the reader, enhanced by his memorable wit and a razor-sharp judgment about men and their motives, made all of his books huge bestsellers. ""Heroes of History"" carries on this tradition of making scholarship and philosophy understandable to the general reader, and making them good reading, as well.<br /><br />At the dawn of a new millennium and the beginning of a new century, nothing could be more appropriate than this brilliant book that examines the meaning of human civilization and history and draws from the experience of the past the lessons we need to know to put the future into context and live in confidence, rather than fear and ignorance.<br /><br />Will Durant's work is marked by his own special quality as a writer -- he is tough-minded, optimistic, courageous, and convinced that without a knowledge of the past there is no wisdom to guide us to the future. ""Heroes of History"" was his last word on the subject, and much of it has been aimed directly at the doubts and fears of people today. It is a major, and unexpected, literary and historical event.<br /><br />This book is also available on audio tape and CD format, read by Will and Ariel Durant.

After reluctantly leaving his family in Boston, Waterhouse arrives in England and is almost killed by a mysterious Infernal Device. Having been away from the war-decimated country for two decades, Waterhouse quickly learns that although many things have changed, there is still violent revolution simmering just beneath the surface of seemingly civilized society. With Queen Anne deathly ill and Tories and Whigs jostling for political supremacy, Waterhouse and Newton vow to figure out who is trying to kill certain scientists and decipher the riddle behind the legend of King Solomon's gold, a mythical hoard of precious metal with miraculous properties.<br /><br />Arguably one of the most ambitious -- and most researched -- stories ever written, Stephenson's Baroque Cycle is set in one of the most turbulent and exciting times in human history. Filled with wild adventure, political intrigue, social upheaval, civilization-changing discoveries, cabalistic mysticism, and even a little romance, this massive saga is worth its weight in (Solomon's) gold. <br /><i>Paul Goat Allen</i>",4.32,908,Paperback, ,567,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116257.The_System_of_the_World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116257.The_System_of_the_World

He changed the world of sports and went on to change the world itself. As Muhammad Ali, he would become the most recognized face on the planet. Ali was a transcendent athlete and entertainer, a heavyweight Fred Astaire, a rapper before rap was born. He was a mirror of his era, a dynamic figure in the racial and cultural battles of his time. This unforgettable story of his rise and self-creation, told by a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer, places Ali in a heritage of great American originals.<br /> <br />Cassius Clay grew up in the Jim Crow South and came of athletic age when boxers were at the mercy of the mob. From the start, Clay rebelled against everything and everyone who would keep him and his people down. He refused the old stereotypes and refused the glad hand of the mob. And, to the confusion and fury of white sportswriters, who were far more comfortable with the self-effacing Joe Louis, Clay came forward as a rebel, insistent on his political views, on his new religion, and, eventually, on a new name. His rebellion nearly cost him the chance to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world.<br /> <br />King of the World features some of the pivotal figures of the 1960s--Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, John F. Kennedy--and its pivotal events: the civil rights movement, political assassinations, the war in Vietnam. Muhammad Ali is a great hero and a beloved figure in American life.

Cultural icons that have stood the test of time (Odysseus, Leaves of Grass, Cleopatra, the Taj Mahal, D-Day) appear alongside entries on such varied concerns as cryptography, the digital divide, the European Union, Kwanzaa, pheromones, SPAM, Type A and Type B personalities, Web browsers, and much, much more.<br /> As our world becomes more global and interconnected, it grows smaller through the terms and touchstones that unite us. As E. D. Hirsch writes in the preface, ""Community is built up of shared knowledge and values -- the same shared knowledge that is taken for granted when we read a book or newspaper, and that is also taken for granted as part of the fabric that connects us to one another."" A delicious concoction of information for anyone who wants to be in the know, The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy brilliantly confirms once again that it is ""an excellent piece of work . . . stimulating and enlightening"" (New York Times) -- the most definitive and comprehensive family sourcebook of its kind.",4.15,672,Hardcover, ,44,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117131.The_New_Dictionary_of_Cultural_Literacy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117131.The_New_Dictionary_of_Cultural_Literacy

Do economic forces of supply and demand help or harm the pursuit of creativity? This book seeks to redress the current intellectual and popular balance and to encourage a more favorable attitude toward the commercialization of culture that we associate with modernity. Economist Tyler Cowen argues that the capitalist market economy is a vital but underappreciated institutional framework for supporting a plurality of co-existing artistic visions, providing a steady stream of new and satisfying creations, supporting both high and low culture, helping consumers and artists refine their tastes, and paying homage to the past by capturing, reproducing, and disseminating it. Contemporary culture, Cowen argues, is flourishing in its various manifestations, including the visual arts, literature, music, architecture, and the cinema.<br /><br />Successful high culture usually comes out of a healthy and prosperous popular culture. Shakespeare and Mozart were highly popular in their own time. Beethoven's later, less accessible music was made possible in part by his early popularity. Today, consumer demand ensures that archival blues recordings, a wide array of past and current symphonies, and this week's Top 40 hit sit side by side in the music megastore. High and low culture indeed complement each other.<br /><br />Cowen's philosophy of cultural optimism stands in opposition to the many varieties of cultural pessimism found among conservatives, neo-conservatives, the Frankfurt School, and some versions of the political correctness and multiculturalist movements, as well as historical figures, including Rousseau and Plato. He shows that even when contemporary culture is thriving, it appears degenerate, as evidenced by the widespread acceptance of pessimism. He ends by considering the reasons why cultural pessimism has such a powerful hold on intellectuals and opinion-makers.",3.69,288,Paperback, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117137.In_Praise_of_Commercial_Culture,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117137.In_Praise_of_Commercial_Culture

Here John Ikenberry asks the question, what do states that win wars do with their newfound power and how do they use it to build order? In examining the postwar settlements in modern history, he argues that powerful countries do seek to build stable and cooperative relations, but the type of order that emerges hinges on their ability to make commitments and restrain power.<br /><br />The author explains that only with the spread of democracy in the twentieth century and the innovative use of international institutions--both linked to the emergence of the United States as a world power--has order been created that goes beyond balance of power politics to exhibit ""constitutional"" characteristics. The open character of the American polity and a web of multilateral institutions allow the United States to exercise strategic restraint and establish stable relations among the industrial democracies despite rapid shifts and extreme disparities in power.<br /><br />Blending comparative politics with international relations, and history with theory, ""After Victory"" will be of interest to anyone concerned with the organization of world order, the role of institutions in world politics, and the lessons of past postwar settlements for today. It also speaks to today's debate over the ability of the United States to lead in an era of unipolar power.",3.65,320,Paperback, ,13,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117205.After_Victory,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117205.After_Victory

Chiang Kai-shek was one of the most influential world figures of the twentieth century. The leader of the Kuomintang, the Nationalist movement in China, by 1928 he had established himself as head of the government in Nanking. But while he managed to survive the political storms of the 1930s, Chiang's power was continually being undermined by the Japanese on one side and the Chinese Communists on the other. Drawing extensively on original Chinese sources and accounts by contemporaneous journalists, acclaimed author Jonathan Fenby explores little-known international connections in Chiang's story as he unfolds a story as fascinating in its conspiratorial intrigues as it is remarkable for its psychological insights.

You'd have something from every major food group, run around the playground for a while, and you looked and felt fine. But today it's not so simple. Schools are actually feeding the American crisis of childhood obesity and malnutrition. Most cafeterias serve a veritable buffet of processed, fried, and sugary foods, and although many schools have attempted to improve, they are still not measuring up: 78 percent of the school lunch programs in America do not meet the USDA's nutritional guidelines.<br /><br />Chef Ann Cooper has emerged as one of the nation's most influential and most respected advocates for changing how our kids eat. In fact, she is something of a renegade lunch lady, minus the hairnet and scooper of mashed potatoes. Ann has worked to transform cafeterias into culinary classrooms. In <em>Lunch Lessons</em>, she and Lisa Holmes spell out how parents and school employees can help instill healthy habits in children.<br /><br />They explain the basics of good childhood nutrition and suggest dozens of tasty, home-tested recipes for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. The pages are also packed with recommendations on how to eliminate potential hazards from the home, bring gardening and composting into daily life, and how to support businesses that provide local, organic food.<br /><br />Yet learning about nutrition and changing the way you run your home will not cure the plague of obesity and poor health for this generation of children. Only parental activism can spark widespread change. With inspirational examples and analysis, <em>Lunch Lessons</em> is more than just a recipe book—it gives readers the tools to transform the way children everywhere interact with food.",3.59,288,Hardcover, ,50,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117796.Lunch_Lessons,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117796.Lunch_Lessons

It has remained in print continuously since its initial appearance, and has recently given rise to some unexpected new offshoots. In 1997, Avon Books released an amended version of the text that restored the middle section -- a downbeat novella published independently as <i>You Can Never Go Back</i> -- to its originally intended place. In early 1999, Haldeman contributed a second related novella --<i>A Separate War</i> -- to Robert Silverberg's anthology, <i>Far Horizons</i>. Most recently, Haldeman reversed his own frequently stated position by publishing a novel-length sequel titled <i>Forever Free</i>. It seems appropriate, in light of this creative flurry, to return to the source -- <i>The Forever War</i> itself -- and take another look.<br /><br /><i>The Forever War</i> was Joe Haldeman's second novel. His first, <i>War Year</i>, was published in 1972, and was a realistic, frankly autobiographical account of its author's experiences as a combat soldier in Vietnam. These experiences, radically reconfigured, also found their way into <i>The Forever War</i>, which is very much a reflection of the lingering effects of the ""seemingly endless"" war in Vietnam. Haldeman's version of that conflict begins in 1996, just one generation after the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. In that year, the combined forces of Earth declare war against an apparently hostile race of aliens known as Taurans. As part of the military response to the Tauran threat, William Mandella, the narrator-hero, is drafted and placed in an elite combat unit composed of the best and brightest members of his own generation. <br /><p><br />In order to engage the remote, enigmatic Taurans, Mandella and his cohorts must travel through a series of ""collapsars,"" anomalous gateways in the fabric of quantum space. Passage through these gateways results in a relativistic phenomenon known as ""time dilation."" By the end of Mandella's first, bloody campaign (which covers about two years of subjective time), more than 25 years have elapsed on his home planet. He returns to Earth to find himself a stranger in a very strange land, where he knows almost no one and where the patterns of day-to-day life have changed beyond recognition. Unable to cope with these changes, he reenters the barbarous but familiar society of the army, accompanied by his friend, lover, and fellow soldier, Marygay Potter. <br /></p><p><br />Back in uniform, Mandella finds himself trapped, once again, in an endless cycle of violence and temporal displacement. He endures (and barely survives) a series of lethal, faceless encounters with an enemy that no one, least of all the political and military leaders of Earth, can begin to understand. In the resulting chaos, the one constant in Mandella's life is his relationship with Marygay. Finally, even that is taken away, and he is left with nothing but the prospect of dying for an incomprehensible cause.<br /></p><p><br />Throughout this process, relativity continues to impose its distortions. As the war carries Mandella and his fellow soldiers toward an increasingly remote series of battlefields, centuries roll by on Earth. In the course of these centuries, populations rise and fall, historical epochs flower and fade, and humanity evolves in unexpected directions. Eventually, at the tail end of a pointless, infinitely protracted war, Mandella returns -- a young/old man of barely 30 -- to a radically altered society he can neither recognize nor live in. In the end, he is forced to confront the fundamental irony of his thousand-year military career: Having left his home to do battle with aliens, he himself has now become the alien, and has no place in the world he fought to preserve.<br /></p><p><br /><i>The Forever War</i> is very much concerned with alienation, which assumes a cruel and quite literal form during the course of the story. And though, like all good novels, it is many things at once -- acerbic portrait of the military mentality; imaginative extrapolation of the principles of relativity; meditation on the future of warfare in a technologically advanced society -- it derives much of its power from its compelling portrait of disenfranchised soldiers detached, by the very nature of their experiences, from the social mainstream. In a way, <i>The Forever War</i> serves as an extravagant metaphor for the actual condition of the soldiers who fought in Vietnam, and who returned home to a divided society that failed, almost completely, to acknowledge their efforts or honor their sacrifices.<br /></p><p><br />After more than a quarter of a century, <i>The Forever War</i> continues to matter, continues to engage our sympathy for the individual men and women caught in the movement of huge, impersonal forces. Like <i>Catch-22</i>, to which it bears a familial resemblance, <i>The Forever War</i> is a novel about the desperate search for sanity in an unreasoning world, and the universality of its concerns makes it as fresh and relevant today as it was in 1975, when the national nightmare of Vietnam was still raw and recent. Literary prognostication may be a fool's game, but the betting here is that <i>The Forever War</i> will endure well into the newly arrived millennium. Its energy, compassion, and bitter, hard-won wisdom are timeless qualities that should, by rights, continue to speak to new generations of readers.<br /></p><p>

It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Waterhouse and Detachment 2702—commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse's crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a ""data haven"" in Southeast Asia—a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.<br /><br />A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, <em>Cryptonomicon</em> is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

Back in print in a newly designed edition, this influential cultural, architectural, and social history of New York is even more popular, selling out its first printing on publication. Rem Koolhaas's celebration and analysis of New York depicts the city as a metaphor for the incredible variety of human behavior. At the end of the nineteenth century, population, information, and technology explosions made Manhattan a laboratory for the invention and testing of a metropolitan lifestyle -- ""the culture of congestion"" -- and its architecture.<br /><br /> ""Manhattan,"" he writes, ""is the 20th century's Rosetta Stone . . . occupied by architectural mutations (Central Park, the Skyscraper), utopian fragments (Rockefeller Center, the U.N. Building), and irrational phenomena (Radio City Music Hall)."" Koolhaas interprets and reinterprets the dynamic relationship between architecture and culture in a number of telling episodes of New York's history, including the imposition of the Manhattan grid, the creation of Coney Island, and the development of the skyscraper. <i>Delirious New York</i> is also packed with intriguing and fun facts and illustrated with witty watercolors and quirky archival drawings, photographs, postcards, and maps.

Katherine Shorter Sherritt Sagamore, 8 1/2 months pregnant, is a blue-blooded library scientist and founding mother of the American Society for the Preservation of Storytelling. Her husband Peter, 8 1/2 months nervous, is a blue-collar storyteller with a penchant for brevity. Sailing in the Chesapeake Bay, they tell each other tales to break the writer's block handed Peter by his Muse, to ease the weight of Katherine's pregnancy, to entertain, and to enlighten. Along with their stories, we learn of the Bay itself—past and present. The beloved Chesapeake, where young Peter once indulged his Huck Finn fantasy, is in danger of becoming what he dubs a moral cesspool; where nature is in a losing struggle with man; where the hallowed Deniston School for Girls is being pressured by the CIA to sell land to the Soviet embassy; and where the old Sagamore homestead might or might not be the newest espionage station on the shoreline.",4.00,655,Paperback, ,21,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118154.The_Tidewater_Tales,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118154.The_Tidewater_Tales

For a period of nearly six years, the German U-boat force attempted to blockade and isolate the British Isles in hopes of forcing the British out of the war, thereby thwarting both the Allied strategic air assault on German cities and Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Occupied France. Fortunately for the Allies, the U-boat force failed to achieve either of these objectives, but in the attempt they sank 2,800 Allied merchant ships, while the Allies sank nearly 800 U-boats. On both sides, tens of thousands of sailors perished.<br />     <br />For decades, an authoritative and definitive history of the Battle of the Atlantic could not be attempted, since London and Washington agreed to withhold all official code-breaking and U-boat records in order to safeguard the secrets of code breaking in the postwar years. The accounts that did appear were incomplete and full of false conclusions and errors of fact, often leaving the entirely wrong impression that the German U-boats came within a whisker of defeating the Allies, a myth that is finally laid to rest in this account.<br />     <br />Clay Blair, acclaimed author of the bestselling naval classic Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War Against Japan, has drawn from the official records as well as the work of German, British, American, and Canadian naval scholars. Never before has Hitler's U-boat war been chronicled with such authority, fidelity, objectivity, and detail. The result is this magnificent and monumental work, crammed with vivid and dramatic scenes of naval actions and dispassionate but startling new revelations, interpretations, and conclusions about all aspects of the Battle of the Atlantic.  ",4.11,864,Paperback, ,33,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118678.Hitler_s_U_Boat_War,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118678.Hitler_s_U_Boat_War

Since American women purchase and consume more wine than American men, 77% and 60% respectively, a voice is needed to help women understand that their busy professional and social lifestyles can be well paired with wine. Master Sommelier and successful television host Alpana Singh, twenty-nine, happens to be just the person who can help them do it.<br /><br />Alpana Singh is uniquely qualified to talk about wine, contemporary women and relationships. At age twenty-six she became the youngest woman to be inducted into the world’s most exclusive sommelier organization, the hundred-and-twenty-member Court of Master Sommeliers. She spent five years as sommelier at a world famous four star restaurant, Everest of Chicago.

Her mental journal of these “social observations” came in handy as she wrote her first book, <i>Alpana Pours</i>.<br /><br /><i>Alpana Pours</i> reaches readers in playful language they will understand, and in a highly entertaining manner they will enjoy. Women want to know how to select wine when entertaining important clients, pair wine with food they and their partner are preparing together, choose the right wines for hostess gifts, bridal showers, a first meeting with a boyfriend’s parents and what wine to, or not to, order on a first date. <i>Alpana Pours</i> supplies tips on these and a myriad of other topics including “dating” and “dealing with guys.” The book’s gender riff on wine and lifestyle is unique and will definitely grab reader’s attention.",3.56,220,Paperback, ,27,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118790.Alpana_Pours,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118790.Alpana_Pours

Knopf,eng,false,"From Neal Gabler, the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in twentieth-century American entertainment and cultural history.<br />Seven years in the making and meticulously researched - Gabler is the first writer to be given complete access to the Disney archives - this is the full story of a man whose work left an ineradicable brand on our culture but whose life has largely been enshrouded in myth.<br />Gabler shows us the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood of discipline and deprivation and making his way to Hollywood. We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films - most notably <i>Snow White</i>, <i>Pinocchio</i>, <i>Fantasia</i>, <i>Dumbo</i>, and <i>Bambi</i> - who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.<br />We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word <i>Disneyfication</i> to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one's personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of ""Walt Disney's America."" We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.<br />Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic. But whatever the characterizations of Disney's personal life, he appealed to the nation by demonstrating the power of wish fulfillment and the triumph of the American imagination. Walt Disney showed how one could impose one's will on the world.<br />This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man - of both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.",4.01,851,Hardcover, ,546,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118824.Walt_Disney,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118824.Walt_Disney

Sidney Kirkpatrick sets the painter’s life and art in the wider context of the changing world he devoted himself to portraying, and he also addresses the artist’s private life—the contradictory impulses, obsessions, and possible psychological illness that fired his work. Kirkpatrick underscores Eakins’s unflinching integrity as an artist and discloses how his profound appreciation of the beauty of the human form was both the source of his greatness and ultimately of his undoing.

Not so much enfolded as trapped in the bosom of the most venal media clique in London, Richard is losing it on all fronts: he's losing his heart to Ursula Bentley, a nubile and vacuous magazine columnist; he's in danger of losing his job at the pretentious listings magazine Rendezvous; he's losing his mind courtesy of Colombia's chief illegal export; and, worst of all, he's losing his soul ... to Bell.

The events of October and November 1969 are now documented in Andru Reeve's ""Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Complete Story of the Paul McCartney Death Hoax"". What made the McCartney death rumour the object of such fascination was the elaborate theory - Paul had been replaced by a ""double"" following his death in a fiery car crash in 1966 - and supporting ""clues"", supposedly planted by the Beatles on their album covers and in their recorded songs. This book probes the origins and recounts the evolving story of the ""Paul-is-dead"" hoax, a shared cultural memory lampooned as recently as February 13, 1993, when McCartney himself was interviewed about his alleged demise during the ""Chris Farley Show"" segment of ""Saturday Night Live"". Andru Reeve's account includes interviews with principles in the development and dissemination of the story - disc-jockey Russ Gibb of Detroit's WKNR radio, college sophomore Fred LaBour (then writing for the University Michigan's ""Michigan Daily""), Dartanyan Brown (then associate editor of Drake University's ""Drake Times-Dephic""), and John Summer, Ohio Wesleyan University's in-house death-hoax expert, as well as comments from the national media perspective by NBC's John Chancellor and ABC anchor Howard K. Smith. As to the origins of the rumour that swept the American Midwest, the entire US, and then circulated around the globe, Reeve points out that rumours of McCartney's death in a car crash had originally made the rounds in England in the first few months of 1967, but were quickly quashed when the press determined that there was no truth to them. Reeve further speculates that the revival of the car-crash story may have its origins in a song called ""Saint Paul,"" a song written by performer Terry Knight and released on Capitol Records a full five months before the rumour gained national prominence, a song which received significant airplay in Knight's adopted hometown - Detroit, Michigan. The main text of ""Turn Me On, Dead Man"" is supported by three appendices, including a discussion of 70 of the ""clues"" to Paul's death purportedly hidden in the Beatles' albums and songs, a reprint of a study by Barbara Suczek called ""The Curious Case of the 'Death' of Paul McCartney"" (originally published in 1972 in the journal ""Urban Life and Culture""), and a look at other rumours associated with the Beatles - Lord Sitar, The Masked Marauders, Futz and Klaatu. An ""Afterword"" by death-rumour expert/lecturer Joel Galzier concludes the work.",3.75,218,Hardcover, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119211.Turn_Me_On_Dead_Man,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119211.Turn_Me_On_Dead_Man

But within thirty years, by even conservative estimates, we will have burned our way through most of the oil that is easily accessible. And well before then, the side effects of an oil-based society—economic volatility, geopolitical conflict, and the climate-changing impact of hydrocarbon pollution—will render fossil fuels an all but unacceptable solution.

Why is this? </p><p> It is because a new species is being born. <i>The Seat of the Soul</i> is about this birth. This new species longs for harmony, cooperation, sharing, and reverence for Life. It uses higher orders of logic and justice -- those of the heart. The number of people who are becoming aware of this birth is growing very fast, because the new species is being born inside all of us. </p><p> <i>The Seat of the Soul</i> provides a vocabulary for this new species -- a vocabulary of authentic power, the alignment of the personality with the soul. Human experience is exploding beyond the five senses, and <i>The Seat of the Soul</i> is about that, too. This is the most exciting time to be on Earth, and <i>The Seat of the Soul</i> describes why. </p><p> As we become aware of our new abilities and values, like a baby opening its eyes and stretching its arms and legs for the first time, we are also becoming aware of an entirely new potential that we have never had before. I have been writing a book about this new potential for nine years. I am looking forward to sharing that with you, too. </p><p> The tremendous growth of interest in <i>The Seat of the Soul</i> is humbling to me. I dream of a world where people respect each other and the living Earth, and spiritual growth is the first priority. I work daily to develop the awareness, compassion, and intentions that are necessary to create it. The extraordinary reception of <i>The Seat of the Soul</i> shows me, among other things, how many fellow souls are doing the same. </p><p> The more this happens, the more I see myself, with gratitude, as a traveler among travelers, an experimenter among experimenters, and a soul among souls. </p><p> Gary Zukav<br /> 1999</p>",4.00,256,Hardcover, ,669,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119760.The_Seat_of_the_Soul,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119760.The_Seat_of_the_Soul

Did a deadly genetic disease help our ancestors survive the bubonic plagues of Europe? Will a visit to the tanning salon help lower your cholesterol? Why do we age? Why are some people immune to HIV? Can your genes be turned on -- or off?<br /><br />Dr. Sharon Moalem turns our current understanding of illness on its head and challenges us to fundamentally change the way we think about our bodies, our health, and our relationship to just about every other living thing on earth, from plants and animals to insects and bacteria.<br /><br />Through a fresh and engaging examination of our evolutionary history, Dr. Moalem reveals how many of the conditions that are diseases today actually gave our ancestors a leg up in the survival sweepstakes. When the option is a long life with a disease or a short one without it, evolution opts for disease almost every time.<br /><br />Everything from the climate our ancestors lived in to the crops they planted and ate to their beverage of choice can be seen in our genetic inheritance.

According to Garry Stevens, however, successful architects owe their success not so much to genius as to social background and a host of other factors that have very little to do with native talent. To concentrate only on the profession of architecture is to ignore the much larger field of architecture, which structures the entire social universe of the architect and of which architects are only one part. This book critically surveys that field, exposing many myths and debunking a number of heroes in the process. Using the conceptual apparatus of French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, Stevens describes the field of architecture on two levels. First, he provides a detailed account of the field as it is at any given point in time, describing the different components and their relationships. Second, he analyzes the dynamics of the field through time, from the Renaissance to the present. He discusses the system of architectural education, as well as everyday aspects such as the competition for reputation. He concludes that throughout history, the most eminent architects have been connected to each other by master-pupil and collegiate relations. These networks, which still exist, provide a mechanism for architectural influence that runs parallel to that of the university-based schools.",3.67,264,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119988.The_Favored_Circle,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119988.The_Favored_Circle

Not only was the writing extraordinary but its sudden and spectacular appearance itself seemed magical. In fact, Latin American literature has a long and rich tradition that reaches back to the Colonial period and is filled with remarkable writers too little known in the English-speaking world. The short story has been a central part of this tradition, from Fray Bartolome de las Casas' narrative protests against the Spanish Conquistadors' abuses of Indians, to the world renowned Ficciones of Jorge Luis Borges, to the contemporary works of such masters as Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Rosario Ferre, and others. <br /> Now, in The Oxford Book of Latin American Short Stories, editor Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria brings together fifty-three stories that span the history of Latin American literature and represent the most dazzling achievements in the form. In his fascinating introduction, Gonzalez Echevarria traces the evolution of the short story in Latin American literature, explaining why the genre has flourished there with such brilliance, and illuminating the various cultural and literary tensions that resolve themselves in ""magical realism."" The stories themselves exhibit all the inventiveness, the luxuriousness of language, the wild metaphoric leaps and uncanny conjunctions of the ordinary with the fantastic that have given the Latin American short story its distinctive and unforgettable flavor: From the Joycean subtlety of Machado de Assis's ""Midnight Mass,"" to the brutal parable of Julio Ramon Ribeyro's ""Featherless Buzzards,"" to the startling disorientation of Alejo Carpentier's ""Journey Back to the Source,"" (which is told backwards, because a sorcerer has waved his wand and made time flow in reverse), to the haunting reveries of Maria Luisa Bombal's ""The Tree."" Readers familiar with only the most popular Latin American writers will be delighted to discover many exciting new voices here, including Catalina de Erauso, Ricardo Palma, Rubin Dario, Augusto Roa Bastos, Christina Peri Rossi, along with Borges, Garcia Marquez, Fuentes, Cortazar, Vargas Llosa, and many others. Gonzalez Echevarria also provides brief and extremely helpful headnotes for the each selection, discussing the author's influences, major works, and central themes.<br /> Short story lovers will find a wealth of satisfactions here, in terrains both familiar and uncharted. But the unique strength of The Oxford Book of Latin American Short Stories is that it allows us to see the connections between writers from Peru to Puerto Rico and from the sixteenth century to the present--and thus to view in a single, unprecedented volume one of the most diverse and fertile literary landscapes in the world.",3.75,496,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/120261.The_Oxford_Book_of_Latin_American_Short_Stories,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/120261.The_Oxford_Book_of_Latin_American_Short_Stories

This collection proceeds chronologically, from poetry and short stories written in Buñuel's youth in Spain to an essay written in 1980, not long before his death. Newly translated into English, the writings offer startling insights into the filmmaker's life and thought. <br /> The earliest pieces came well before Buñuel joined the Surrealist movement in Paris and created the landmark film <i>Un chien andalou</i> with Salvador Dalí. Yet these and the early Surrealist writings reveal the inventiveness of the mind that would later create such masterpieces of cinema as <i>L'Age d'or</i>, <i>Los olvidados</i>, <i>Viridiana</i>, <i>The Milky Way</i>, <i>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</i>, and <i>That Obscure Object of Desire</i>. <br /> Later writings, which include screenplays and reflections on his own and others' films, illuminate many aspects of Buñuel's career, as well as the ways of thinking and perceiving that underlie his unique cinematic style. The final essay by this extraordinary artist sums up his view of the worldstill vibrant and full of contradictionsat the end of his life.</p>",4.11,277,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/120542.An_Unspeakable_Betrayal,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/120542.An_Unspeakable_Betrayal

In the process, the boy learns to look and finds that, for him, the camera is a means of finding things his naked eye has missed--things like inevitability of his mother's departure and the love that still binds his family.",3.76,83,Paperback, ,56,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121404.Journey,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121404.Journey

The book overall contains less detail concerning specific events than typical autobiographies. This is because his purpose in writing wasn't primarily historical. His aim was to identify &amp; describe the events surrounding his accidental discovery of &amp; consequent search for the phenomenon he labelled ""Joy"". This word was the best translation he could make of the German idea of Sehnsucht, longing. That isn't to say the book is devoid of information about his life. He recounts his early years with a measure of amusement sometimes mixed with pain. <br /><br />However, while he does describe his life, the principal theme of the book is Joy as he defined it. This Joy was a longing so intense for something so good &amp; so high up it couldn't be explained with words. He's struck with ""stabs of joy"" throughout life. He finally finds what it's for at the end. He writes about his experiences at Malvern College in 1913, aged 15. Though he described the school as ""a very furnace of impure loves"" he defended the practice as being ""the only chink left thru which something spontaneous &amp; uncalculating could creep in."" The book's last two chapters cover the end of his search as he moves from atheism to theism &amp; then from theism to Christianity. He ultimately discovers the true nature &amp; purpose of Joy &amp; its place in his own life. <br /><br />The book isn't connected with his unexpected marriage in later life to Joy Gresham. The marriage occurred long after the period described, though not long after the book was published. His friends were quick to notice the coincidence, remarking he'd really been ""Surprised by Joy"". ""Surprised by Joy"" is also an allusion to Wordsworth's poem, ""Surprised by Joy-Impatient As The Wind"", relating an incident when Wordsworth forgot the death of his beloved daughter.",4.06,185,Paperback, ,1311,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121732.Surprised_by_Joy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121732.Surprised_by_Joy

At 13, an orphan, and unhappily married, Miyax runs away from her husband's parents' home, hoping to reach San Francisco and her pen pal. But she becomes lost in the vast Alaskan tundra, with no food, no shelter, and no idea which is the way to safety. Now, more than ever, she must look hard at who she really is. Is she Miyax, Eskimo girl of the old ways? Or is she Julie (her ""gussak""-white people-name), the modernized teenager who must mock the traditional customs? And when a pack of wolves begins to accept her into their community, Miyax must learn to think like a wolf as well. If she trusts her Eskimo instincts, will she stand a chance of surviving?

After two grueling years on the island of Tarawa, battling feral dogs, machete-wielding neighbors, and a lack of beer on a daily basis, Maarten Troost was in no hurry to return to the South Pacific. But as time went on, he realized he felt remarkably out of place among the trappings of twenty-first-century America.

When Sylvia gets pregnant, they decamp for slightly-more-civilized Fiji, a fallen paradise where the local chiefs can be found watching rugby in the house next door.

The extraordinary new novel from the critically acclaimed author of <em>Love in the Asylum</em> and <em>The Mermaids Singing</em> is a darkly absorbing, deeply realistic portrait of adolescence, family, and grief.<br /><br />The Fureys are a family divided in time. Five years ago, the eldest son, Hugh, left home in the middle of the night and never returned. After two years of exhausting and fruitless searching, his parents, estranged by grief, try to put the tragedy behind them. His mother recovers from an emotional breakdown by losing herself in a new career. His father, having lost his faith as well as his position as a theology professor, takes on the role of caregiver for their remaining two children with lackluster effort.<br /><br />Owen and Lena, left to fend for themselves, hold on to the memory of their brother with increasingly self-destructive obsessions. Ten-year-old Owen, prompted by the iconic angels in his father's former study, calls on Hugh as a guardian angel as his own sexual experimentation turns dangerous. Fifteen-year-old Lena explores drugs, boys, and truancy, and begins a search for Hugh—and for herself—through the lens of his old camera. As she spirals increasingly out of control, she forces the family to face their past . . . and find a future.<br /><br />A moving, lyrically written novel that captures the darkness of adolescence and the complex relationships within a family, Lisa Carey's <em>Every Visible Thing</em> is a story born of grief and disillusionment that is ultimately a testament to the power of hope, faith, and love.",3.71,320,Hardcover, ,69,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122942.Every_Visible_Thing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122942.Every_Visible_Thing

The disembodied yet interconnected characters include Sara, a 19-year-old chambermaid who has recently died at the hotel; her bereaved sister, Clare, who visits the scene of Sara's death; Penny, an advertising copywriter who is staying in the room opposite; Lise, the Global's depressed receptionist; and the homeless Else who begs on the street outside. Smith's ambitious prose explores all facets of language and its uses. Sara takes us through the moment of her exit from the world and beyond; in her desperate, fading grip on words and senses she gropes to impart the meaning of her death in what she terms ""the lift for dishes""--then comes a flash of clarity: ""That's the name for it, the name for it; that's it; dumb waiter dumb waiter dumb waiter."" Blended with hers are other voices: Penny's bland journalese and Else's obsession with metaphysical poetry. <p> <i>Hotel World</i> is not an easy read: disturbing and witty by turns, with its stream-of-consciousness narrators reminiscent of Virgina Woolf's <i>The Waves</i>, its deceptively rambling language is underpinned by a formal construction. Exploring the ""big themes"" of love, death and millennial capitalism, it takes as its starting point Muriel Spark's <i>Momento Mori</i> (""Remember you must die"") and counteracts this axiom with a resolute ""Remember you must live"".

Mr. Compton taught Pope and Young how to make and use archery <br />equipment. This mixture of sportsmen and talent inspired the able writings of <br />Saxton Pope, thus spawning the birth of recreational bowhunting. Pope and <br />Young traveled to distant lands as far as Africa to take Lions with their <br />sticks and strings. Both men wrote many articles in the sporting magazines of <br />their time and Saxton Pope wrote 5 books, <i>The Medical History of Ishi</i>, <br /><i>Yahi Archery</i>, <i>A Study of Bows and Arrows</i>, <i>Hunting with the Bow &amp; Arrow</i>, and <i>Adventurous Bowmen</i>.

But the little girl who first performed ""Jingle Bells"" at the tender age of four on stage with her mother was blessed with her own talent, zest for living, and knack for survival. This is the first insider portrait of one of Hollywood's most celebrated families-- and a remarkably intimate and loving chronicle of an astonishing childhood and a struggle to overcome a legacy of fame and self-destructive behavior. The question follows her to this day: ""What's it like to be Dorothy's daughter?"" Although by appearances glamorous and at times truly thrilling, growing up as the daughter of Judy Garland and producer Sid Luft was anything but a journey over the rainbow. With unsparing candor, Lorna Luft reveals a rare story of a little girl, her half-sister Liza Minnelli, and baby brother trying desperately to hang on to the mother whose life seemed destined to burn brightly but briefly. A beautiful and brilliant performer, Judy was a warm and funny woman who loved her children unconditionally-- but she was also the victim of a powerful dependence on alcohol and prescription drugs, which eventually claimed her life.<br /><br />Now her daughter, Lorna, makes an extraordinary journey back into the spiral of love, addiction, pain, and loss that lurked behind a charmed facade. Filled with behind-the-scenes dramas, hilarious untold stories, and little-known details of Garland family life, it is a tribute to Lorna's victory over her own past. The proud mother of two children, she has at last laid the groundwork that enables her to share the tale only she could tell, unveiling the intensely personal side of life as Judy Garland's daughter.<br /><br />Ultimately a story of forgiveness and hope, of love and its limitations, ""Me And My Shadows"" is a deeply moving testament to the healing powers of embracing one's past, facing one's demons, and charting a course of self-love and discovery.",3.87,432,Hardcover, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123467.Me_and_My_Shadows,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123467.Me_and_My_Shadows

Can thought arise out of matter? Can a self, a soul, a consciousness, an ""I"" arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? <i>I Am a Strange Loop</i> argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is the ""strange loop""--a special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. Deep down, a human brain is a chaotic seething soup of particles, on a higher level it is a jungle of neurons, and on a yet higher level it is a network of abstractions that we call ""symbols."" The most central and complex symbol in your brain or mine is the one we both call ""I."" The ""I"" is the nexus in our brain where the levels feed back into each other and flip causality upside down, with symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse. For each human being, this ""I"" seems to be the realest thing in the world. But how can such a mysterious abstraction be real--or is our ""I"" merely a convenient fiction? Does an ""I"" exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the all-powerful laws of physics? These are the mysteries tackled in <i>I Am a Strange Loop</i>, Douglas R. Hofstadter's first book-length journey into philosophy since <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i>.

Jung's insistence on the psychogenic and symbolic significance of such states is even more timely now than then. As R. D. Laing stated... 'It was Jung who broke the ground here, but few followed him.'""--From the introduction by Sonu Shamdasani<br /><br /><br />Jung's seminar on Kundalini yoga, presented to the Psychological Club in Zurich in 1932, has been widely regarded as a milestone in the psychological understanding of Eastern thought and of the symbolic transformations of inner experience. Kundalini yoga presented Jung with a model for the developmental phases of higher consciousness, and he interpreted its symbols in terms of the process of individuation. With sensitivity toward a new generation's interest in alternative religions and psychological exploration, Sonu Shamdasani has brought together the lectures and discussions from this seminar. In this volume, he re-creates for today's reader the fascination with which many intellectuals of prewar Europe regarded Eastern spirituality as they discovered more and more of its resources, from yoga to tantric texts. Reconstructing this seminar through new documentation, Shamdasani explains, in his introduction, why Jung thought that the comprehension of Eastern thought was essential if Western psychology was to develop. He goes on to orient today's audience toward an appreciation of some of the questions that stirred the minds of Jung and his seminar group: What is the relation between Eastern schools of liberation and Western psychotherapy? What connection is there between esoteric religious traditions and spontaneous individual experience? What light do the symbols of Kundalini yoga shed on conditions diagnosed as psychotic? Not only were these questions important to analysts in the 1930s but, as Shamdasani stresses, they continue to have psychological relevance for readers on the threshold of the twenty-first century. This volume also offers newly translated material from Jung's German language seminars, a seminar by the indologist Wilhelm Hauer presented in conjunction with that of Jung, illustrations of the cakras, and Sir John Woodroffe's classic translation of the tantric text, the <i>Sat-cakra Nirupana.</i><br /> ?",4.07,128,Paperback, ,15,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123675.The_Psychology_of_Kundalini_Yoga,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123675.The_Psychology_of_Kundalini_Yoga

And central to Caribbean literature is the short story, with its ties with the oral tradition. Now, The Oxford Book of Caribbean Short Stories, edited by Stewart Brown and John Wickham, brings together fifty-two stories in a major anthology representing over a century's worth of pan-Caribbean short fiction. This breathtaking collection is unique--and indispensable--in its inclusion of authors from the English, French, Spanish, and Dutch-speaking Caribbean. <br />The distinctly Anglophone viewpoint of such prominent authors as, Jean Rhys, Sam Sevlon, V.S. Naipual, and E.A. Markham is richly contrasted by contributions from French, Spanish, and Dutch writers like Alejo Carpentier, Ren Depestre, and Thea Doelwijt, while the new generation--represented by such writers as Edwidge Danticat and Patrick Chamoiseau--points the way forward for Caribbean writing into the twenty-first century. With his stimulating introduction, Brown provides an up-to-date overview of Caribbean writing. Exploring the literature's themes of history, race, social justice, identity, and migration, he traces its evolution from the gritty naturalism of the Anglophone tradition to the magical realism of the French and Spanish traditions to a body of contemporary pan-Caribbean literature that cannot be contained in any convenient linguistic, geographical, or thematic definition. <br />Charting the shifting ideologies and styles of this century--from the flamboyant wit of Samuel Selvon to the deceptive simplicity of Jamaica Kincaid--The Oxford Book of Caribbean Short Stories delivers a wealth of satisfactions in a single volume with unprecedented range.",3.89,476,Paperback, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123960.The_Oxford_Book_of_Caribbean_Short_Stories,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123960.The_Oxford_Book_of_Caribbean_Short_Stories

James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa—'Most excellent among Women'—the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company.<br /><br />It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant.<br /><br />In <b>White Mughals</b>, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. <b>White Mughals</b>, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.",3.93,580,Paperback, ,291,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124432.White_Mughals,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124432.White_Mughals

In one, it advanced the enlightenment project of a universal civilization. In the other, it framed terms for peaceful coexistence between warring communities and different ways of life. Each of these liberal ideals of toleration, developed when a single worldview dominated society, has many historic achievements to its credit. But how relevant is traditional liberalism in a world where Kosovo represents the collapse of the spirit of cohabitation?<br /><br />In a spirited attack on today’s liberal orthodoxies, Gray argues that establishing a <i>modus vivendi</i> between different cultures and regimes should be at the heart of contemporary liberalism. In this major contribution to political theory, Gray proposes a new framework for liberal thought that addresses these burning issues.<br /><br /><br />",3.85,176,Paperback, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124543.Two_Faces_of_Liberalism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124543.Two_Faces_of_Liberalism

He was a controversial figure who emerged during the 1960s, and his enigmatic style and influence have grown steadily since his death in 1971. Known as a poet, mystic, and shaman, the ""Lizard King"" performed rock concerts like rituals and took the worship of Dionysus seriously, carrying the torch of Pagan ideals all the way to death. Because of his bizarre cult status, the real man has gradually disappeared behind the myth. <br /><br />In <i>The Lizard King: The Essential Jim Morrison,</i> Morrison's biographer Jerry Hopkins reassesses Morrison's life and offers profound insights about Jim as a man, rather than the rock star he became. Through a series of interviews with rock journalists Ben Fong-Torres, John Tobler, Bob Chorush, Salli Stevenson, and others, readers will learn about an articulate, intelligent, and witty man who consciously created his own myth, then lived to regret it.

Como señala Zadie Smith, dos son las preocupaciones básicas que crean el vínculo de unión en todas estas narraciones, por otro lado tan variadas y diferentes: la primera es el miedo a la muerte y la segunda, la publicidad. Ambas íntimamente ligadas. La muerte nos priva del cuerpo, de la conciencia, pero existe una segunda muerte que se analiza en estos relatos con mayor apasionamiento aún: la muerte de la autenticidad. La publicidad acecha en estas historias como una encarnación del mal en el mundo, algo que reemplaza la voz humana por textos publicitarios. A esto hay que añadir, sin duda alguna, el sentido del humor, otra de las características comunes de esta antología; sentido del humor que roza en ocasiones la ferocidad. Es ésta, pues, una asombrosa colección de relatos que pone de manifiesto la extraordinaria riqueza del panorama actual de la narrativa estadounidense y su heterogeneidad.

When tipsy, 23-year-old Maurey Pierce Talbot accidentally drives through her Wyoming town with her baby on the roof of her car, she realizes just how far she has sunk since her father's death left her distraught and almost unhinged. (She writes him daily picture postcards, knowing full well he is gone but unable to come to terms with her loss.) <br /><br />After attempting suicide and being thrown out by her philandering husband, she meets Lloyd and Shane, two recovering alcoholics who have devised a scheme to smuggle Coors beer to the East Coast. Longing to be reunited with her eight-year-old daughter Shannon in North Carolina (Sandlin chronicled Shannon's birth in Skipped Parts ), Maurey decamps on an unlikely odyssey, pulling a horse trailer full of beer behind a broken-down old ambulance, sipping Yukon Jack from the bottle as her companions search for AA meetings. Maurey is not yet ready to deal with her alcoholism or her reluctance to be loved, but the hardships of the road and the bonds that unite this group of refugees (others join them along the way) will change that. <br /><br />Maurey's wry, cocksure voice evokes both her cowgirl roots and the novel's '70s setting. Despite the bickering, sarcasm, cynicism and personal tragedy that season the lives of his colorful, credible characters, Sandlin fashions a convincing tale of redemption.<br /><br />-<b>Publishers Weekly</b>",3.99,416,Paperback, ,42,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125155.Sorrow_Floats,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125155.Sorrow_Floats
