The stranger claims to be the child of a lost Mughal princess, the youngest sister of Akbar's grandfather Babar: Qara Koz, 'Lady Black Eyes', a great beauty believed to possess powers of enchantment and sorcery, who is taken captive first by an Uzbek warlord, then by the Shah of Persia, and finally becomes the lover of a certain Argalia, a Florentine soldier of fortune, commander of the armies of the Ottoman Sultan. When Argalia returns home with his Mughal mistress the city is mesmerized by her presence, and much trouble ensues. <i>The Enchantress of Florence</i> is the story of a woman attempting to command her own destiny in a man's world. It brings together two cities that barely know each other - the hedonistic Mughal capital, in which the brilliant emperor wrestles daily with questions of belief, desire and the treachery of sons, and the equally sensual Florentine world of powerful courtesans, humanist philosophy and inhuman torture, where Argalia's boyhood friend ""il Machia"" - Niccolo' Machiavelli - is learning, the hard way, about the true brutality of power. These two worlds, so far apart, turn out to be uncannily alike, and the enchantments of women hold sway over them both. But is Mogor's story true? And if so, then what happened to the lost princess?

Murray is adept at holding together a complex narrative and creating characters who reach out emotionally to the reader upon first meeting.<br /><br />Global in scope, classical in form, evocative of place, and deeply emotional, this collection marks the beginning of what promises to be an illustrious career.",3.87,274,Paperback, ,49,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319874.A_Few_Short_Notes_on_Tropical_Butterflies,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319874.A_Few_Short_Notes_on_Tropical_Butterflies

He buys the work; tracks down the artist, Bill Wechsler; and the two men embark on a life-long friendship.<br />Leo's story, which spans twenty-five years, follows the evolution of the growing involvement between his family and Bill's-an intricate constellation of attachments that includes the two men; their wives, Erica and Violet; and their children, Matthew and Mark. The families live in the same building in New York, share a house in Vermont during the summer, keep up a lively exchange of thoughts and ideas, and find themselves permanently altered by one another. Over the years, they not only enjoy love but endure loss-in one case sudden, incapacitating loss; in another, a different kind, one that is hidden and slow-growing, and which insidiously erodes the fabric of their lives.<br />Intimate in tone and seductive in its complexity, the novel moves seamlessly from inner worlds to outer worlds, from the deeply private to the public, from physical infirmity to cultural illness. Part family novel, part psychological thriller, ""What I Loved"" is a beautifully written exploration of love, loss, and betrayal-and of a man's attempt to make sense of the world and go on living.<br />",4.06,384,Hardcover, ,29,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1320533.What_I_Loved,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1320533.What_I_Loved

So begins a relationship that spans twenty years, as it takes Julian and Mia across the country and through the depths of family tragedy, love and friendship, money and ambition, desire and tensions of faith.<br /><br />From the moment he was born, Julian Wainwright has lived a life of Waspy privilege. The son of a Yale-educated investment banker, he grew up in a huge apartment on Sutton Place, high above the East River, and attended a tony Manhattan private school. Yet, more than anything, he wants to get out–out from under his parents’ influence, off to Graymont College, in western Massachusetts, where he hopes to become a writer.<br /><br />When he arrives, in the fall of 1986, Julian meets Carter Heinz, a scholarship student from California with whom he develops a strong but ambivalent friendship. Carter’s mother, desperate to save money for his college education, used to buy him reversible clothing, figuring she was getting two items for the price of one. Now, spending time with Julian, Carter seethes with resentment. He swears he will grow up to be wealthy–wealthier, even, than Julian himself.<br /><br />Then, one day, flipping through the college facebook, Julian and Carter see a photo of Mia Mendelsohn. Mia from Montreal, they call her. Beautiful, Jewish, the daughter of a physics professor at McGill, Mia is – Julian and Carter agree – dreamy, urbane, stylish, refined.<br /><br />But Julian gets to Mia first, meeting her by chance in the college laundry room. Soon they begin a love affair that–spurred on by family tragedy–will carry them to graduation and beyond, taking them through several college towns, over the next ten years. Then Carter reappears, working for an Internet company in California, and he throws everyone’s life into turmoil: Julian’s, Mia’s, his own.<br /><br />Starting at the height of the Reagan era and ending in the new millennium, Matrimony is about love and friendship, about money and ambition, desire and tensions of faith. It asks what happens to a marriage when it is confronted by betrayal and the specter of mortality. What happens when people marry younger than they’d expected? Can love endure the passing of time?<br /><br />In its emotional honesty, its luminous prose, its generosity and wry wit, Matrimony is a beautifully detailed portrait of what it means to share a life with someone–to do it when you’re young, and to try to do it afresh on the brink of middle age.",3.10,291,Hardcover, ,241,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1330763.Matrimony,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1330763.Matrimony

But by performing the essential historical task of separating what happened from what did not, and by distinguishing in this way the choices which have been made from those which have yet to be decided, it is my hope that this effort will help to establish that common basis for understanding which is essential for the debate over specific issues to proceed most effectively. This book, then, is scarcely the last word on the Owens Valley conflict: the final chapter, after all, has yet to be written. The story that has emerged here is at once very different and more troubling than the conventional treatments of the conflict as a simplistic political morality play. Any attempt to deal with so controversial a subject, however, is almost certain to spark controversy itself. For that reason, with the exception of a small collection of private letters, this work is constructed entirely from the published documents and other materials available to the general public, anchoring the narrative in sources the reader can consult to trace the line of my argument on any point with which he or she may disagree. In addition, the work as a whole has been reviewed for technical accuracy by officials of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, although the department is in no way responsible for the content of this study or the conclusions drawn from it.",4.16,584,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1341609.Water_and_Power,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1341609.Water_and_Power

Testimonials to physical work have always celebrated the dignity, the economic and moral value, even the nobility of blue-collar labor, but rarely the thought required to get the job done right. The lightning-fast organization and mental calculations of the waitress; the complex spatial mathematics of the carpenter; the aesthetic and intellectual dexterity of the hair stylist—our failure to acknowledge or respect these qualities has undermined a large portion of America’s working population. In <i>The Mind at Work</i> award-winning writer Mike Rose sets the record straight by taking a long hard look at the intellectual demands of common work.<p> Integrating personal stories of his own working-class family with interviews, vivid snapshots of people on the job, and current research in social science and cognitive psychology, Rose draws a brilliantly original portrait of America at work. As he probes the countless decisions, computations, and subtle judgments made every day by welders and plumbers, waitresses and electricians, Rose redefines the nature of important work and overturns the “hand/brain” dichotomy that blinds us to the real contributions of working people.</p>",3.76,288,Hardcover, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1347973.The_Mind_at_Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1347973.The_Mind_at_Work

In addition to his poetic work, Vallejo also wrote theater, journalistic essays and fiction. However, compared with the critical studies of his poetry, there is very little analysis of his other work available. Vallejo's prose fiction, complement and projection of his poetic work, has rarely been studied but it merits close examination. When Vallejo's prose is contextualized chronologically, aesthetically and ideologically, a significantly richer reading of both his prose and poetry is enabled, which contributes to a deeper understanding of the author's literary intentions. In El Tungsteno and in Paco Yunque, in addition to the author's concerns about social and ideological themes, the reader can see the aesthetic conception of a politically committed art and the ways in which the author, who was never neutral, either in the political or in the social sphere, utilized fiction as a medium to engage the reader and awaken his conscience. At the same time, Vallejo was preoccupied with showing the dynamics within the narrative structure through which the different narrative levels are permeated by one primary thematic relationship: corruption. For this reason, from the moment these two texts were first published, Peruvian, as well as foreign, critics recognized their importance in expressing the artistic vision through which Vallejo denounced the corruption and destruction that pervaded all levels of society, a corruption and destruction provoked by the politics of environmental and human destruction and manipulation that industrialized nations imposed upon countries with deficient social and political infrastructures. In Paco Yunque, Vallejo also underlines the sociocultural problem that is created when a deviant masculinity develops in members of the upper classes, revealing endemic evils of a society which have their origin in homes and schools, and which have consequences for the entire country. This edition, by Prof. Flor Maria Rodrigues-Arenas, includes a detailed introductory analysis and footnotes that allow the reader to better comprehend the text and understand its importance within Hispanic American literature.""",3.65,168,Paperback, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1348873.El_Tungsteno_Paco_Yunque,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1348873.El_Tungsteno_Paco_Yunque

What parent doesn’t think back longingly to a time when carefree play with other kids and a simpler life was the norm? Childhood should be a precious time of oasis from the realities of the adult world, yet in today’s fast-paced, achievement-obsessed, ever-more-dangerous society, this is increasingly not the case. <br /><br /> Based on renowned early childhood development expert Nancy Carlsson-Paige’s thirty years of researching and writing about young children, this groundbreaking book helps parents navigate the cultural currents shaping, and too often harming, the lives of kids today and restore childhood to the very best of what it can and should be. <br /><br /> There are three attributes critical to all children’s healthy development, Carlsson-Paige explains: time and space for creative play, a feeling of security in today’s often frightening world, and strong, meaningful relationships with both adults and other children—attributes that we, as a society, are failing to protect and nurture. Grounded in child development theory and research, <i>Taking Back Childhood</i> reveals practical, hands-on steps parents can take to create a safe, open, and imaginative environment in which kids can relish childhood and flourish as human beings.",3.93,304,Hardcover, ,48,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1356249.Taking_Back_Childhood,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1356249.Taking_Back_Childhood

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.</p><p>Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.</p><p>The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.</p><p><i>In Veronika Decides to Die,</i> Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, <i>Veronika Decides to Die</i> questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.</p>",3.70,240,Soft Cover, ,18,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1358478._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1358478._

Well, that just may be a career breaker. Odds are the idea or product that will transform your business or industry tomorrow is out there right now, hiding in the shadows of the Fringe, raw, messy, untamed, and just waiting to be exploited. Trapping, taming, and marketing it is the key to burying your competition and staying ahead of your market.<br /><br />Deviance is nothing more than a marked separation from the norm and is the source of innovation, the kind of breakthrough thinking that creates new markets and tumbles traditional ones. Positive deviation is an inexhaustible font of new ideas, products, and services. It’s the source of all creative thinking and dynamic new market development and ultimately the basis of all incremental profit. <br /><br /><b>The Deviant’s Advantage</b> describes how deviance proceeds along a traceable trajectory from the Fringe, where it originates but has zero commercial potential; to the Edge, where word of mouth creates a limited audience; to the Realm of the Cool, where the buzz and market momentum really start to build; to the Next Big Thing, where demand is honed and intensifies; finally landing at Social Convention, the heart of the mass market. <br /><br />Ryan Mathews and Watts Wacker, two of America’s most respected futurists, trace the “Path of the Devox” (the voice, spirit, or incarnation of deviant ideas, products, and individuals), using it as a way to explain how and why:<br />* Christian fundamentalism morphed from college Bible studies to Republican party king-making<br />* Reebok cares more about what’s on the feet of kids in Detroit and Philadelphia than what the so-hip-it-hurts set is wearing in New York or on Rodeo Drive<br />* Napster exploded from an idea germinating inside a sixteen-year-old to a movement with 60 million subscribers that very nearly destroyed the music industry<br />* Hugh Hefner went from America’s most public pornographer to a cultural icon with decidedly Puritan sensibilities<br /><br />Mathews and Wacker also look at what happens to formerly deviant products and ideas after they are replaced by the next wave from the Fringe—how they morph into Cliché (where their commercial potential may actually increase), become Icons or even Archetypes, or fade into Oblivion, and how you can profitably manage even a fading concept.<br /><br />Looking for the next big idea for your business? Then it’s past time to quit staring at the Social Convention for inspiration and start scouring the Fringes of society. Tomorrow’s breakthrough concept is lurking out there right now, in the mind of a deviant individual. Your choice is simple: find it and exploit it, or be buried by those who do.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.64,288,Hardcover, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1374695.The_Deviant_s_Advantage,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1374695.The_Deviant_s_Advantage

And since 2003, this remarkable project has been collecting the stories of everyday Americans and preserving them for future generations. In New York City and in mobile recording booths traveling the country-from small towns to big cities, at Native American reservations and an Army post-StoryCorps is collecting the memories of Americans from all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life. The project represents a wondrous nationwide celebration of our shared humanity, capturing for posterity the stories that define us and bind us together.<br /><br /> In <i>Listening Is an Act of Love</i>, StoryCorps founder and legendary radio producer Dave Isay selects some of the most remarkable stories from the already vast collection and arranges them thematically into a moving portrait of American life. The voices here connect us to real people and their lives-to their experiences of profound joy, sadness, courage and despair, to good times and hard times, to good deeds and misdeeds.<br /><br /> To read this book is to be reminded of how rich and varied the American storybook truly is, how resistant to easy categorization or caricature. Above all, this book honors the gift each StoryCorps participant has made, from the raw material of his or her life, to the Americans who will come after.

What <i>The Year of Magical Thinking</i> did for grief, what <i>Drinking: A Love Story</i> did for alcoholism, now Split does for divorce. Prescriptive yet full of pragmatic advice, insight and black humor, Split is a finely wrought tourniquet for a broken union and its attendant trauma. <br /><br /> Suzanne Finnamore, author of the novel Otherwise Engaged, didn�t see it coming. Well, perhaps she saw something�for example, a cocktail napkin on which her husband, N, had scribbled a Cole Porter love song and someone else�s name�but she refused to acknowledge it. She was busy tending to their one-year-old son, then applying makeup, donning high heels, and mixing a martini to greet N with when he arrived home at night. Until the night N came home, told her she looked beautiful, changed his clothes, and announced that he was leaving. <br /><br /> In crystalline, riveting prose, Finnamore tells the story of her divorce, and her marriage, and how it all imploded and came back together, changed.

Priceless and beautiful, the book is one of the earliest Jewish volumes ever to be illuminated with images. When Hanna, a caustic loner with a passion for her work, discovers a series of tiny artifacts in its ancient binding—an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair—she begins to unlock the book’s mysteries. The reader is ushered into an exquisitely detailed and atmospheric past, tracing the book’s journey from its salvation back to its creation. <br /><br />In Bosnia during World War II, a Muslim risks his life to protect it from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of fin-de-siècle Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in the struggle against the city’s rising anti-Semitism. In inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it from burning. In Barcelona in 1492, the scribe who wrote the text sees his family destroyed by the agonies of enforced exile. And in Seville in 1480, the reason for the Haggadah’s extraordinary illuminations is finally disclosed. Hanna’s investigation unexpectedly plunges her into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics. Her experiences will test her belief in herself and the man she has come to love. <br /><br />Inspired by a true story, <i>People of the Book</i> is at once a novel of sweeping historical grandeur and intimate emotional intensity, an ambitious, electrifying work by an acclaimed and beloved author.",4.02,372,Hardcover, ,10214,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1379961.People_of_the_Book,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1379961.People_of_the_Book

Es la obra literaria más influyente no solo de la Era de Oro de la Literatura Española, pero también de toda literatura en la lengua española. El Quijote es una obra fundadora de la Literatura Occidental, siendo parte del Canon Occidental, siendo considerada la novela moderna, además de ser la más leída después de la Biblia. Es la primera obra genuinamente desmitificadora de la tradición caballeresca y cortés por su tratamiento burlesco. Representa la primera novela moderna y la primera novela polifónica; como tal, ejerció un enorme influjo en toda la narrativa europea.<br /><br />El título de esta fue <i>El Ingenioso caballero don Quijote de la Mancha</i> y consta de 74 capítulos. En el prólogo, Cervantes se defiende irónicamente de las acusaciones del lopista Avellaneda y se lamenta de la dificultad del arte de novelar: la fantasía se vuelve tan insaciable como un perro hambriento. En la novela se juega con diversos planos de la realidad al incluir, dentro de ella, la edición de la primera parte del Quijote y, posteriormente, la de la apócrifa Segunda parte, que los personajes han leído. Cervantes se defiende de las inverosimilitudes que se han encontrado en la primera parte, como la misteriosa reaparición del rucio de Sancho después de ser robado por Ginés de Pasamonte y el destino de los dineros encontrados en una maleta de Sierra Morena, etc.<br /><br />Así pues, en esta segunda entrega don Quijote y Sancho son conscientes del éxito editorial de la primera parte de sus aventuras y ya son célebres. De hecho, algunos de los personajes que aparecerán en lo sucesivo han leído el libro y los reconocen. Es más, en un alarde de clarividencia, tanto Cervantes como el propio don Quijote manifiestan que la novela pasará a convertirse en un clásico de la literatura y que la figura del hidalgo se verá a lo largo de los siglos como símbolo de La Mancha.<br /><br />La obra empieza con el renovado propósito de don Quijote de volver a las andadas y sus preparativos para ello, no sin la fiera resistencia de su sobrina y el ama. El cura y el barbero tienen que confesar la locura de don Quijote y urden, junto al bachiller Sansón Carrasco, un nuevo plan que les permita recluir a don Quijote por un largo tiempo en su aldea. Por su parte, don Quijote renueva los ofrecimientos a Sancho prometiéndole la ansiada ínsula a cambio de su compañía. Sancho reacciona obsesionándose con la idea de ser gobernador y cambiar de estatus social, lo que provoca la burla de su esposa Teresa Panza.

Prescott effectively captures the pain experienced by his characters and how it leads them to terrifying acts of desperation.",3.78,400,Paperback, ,20,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1387868.Comes_the_Dark,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1387868.Comes_the_Dark

Now, in <i>Children of God Go Bowling</i>, we find Shannon in her mid-thirties and still besieged by reminders that her life is anything but normal. Her friends are blossoming in marital bliss, everyone seems to own a home, and even her baby sister is having a baby. Why, in the march to adulthood, has she been left behind? <p> In an effort to be proactive, Shannon embarks upon a feng shui-inspired campaign to make room in her life for a future—or at least the hope of one. She joins group therapy (to meet new people), accepts blind dates (hey, you never know), and even gives organized religion a go (with mixed results). Of course, surprises await her in the struggle against anxiety—and from some unlikely sources. </p><p> With encore performances by Shannon’s mother, Flo (called “one of the great moms of American fiction” by Garrison Keillor), and other indelible characters from <i>Welcome to My Planet, Children of God Go Bowling</i> is the heroic, heartbreaking, hilarious story of a woman making her life happen when it didn’t quite happen for her.</p>",3.46,304,Hardcover, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1388025.Children_of_God_Go_Bowling,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1388025.Children_of_God_Go_Bowling

The novel is a seemingly simple, touching idyll of young love. But its simplicity is deceptive, for the story is imbued with a passionate lyricism and that brooding melancholy that pervades much of Hamsun's writing. The star-crossed young lovers are Johannes, the miller's son, and Victoria, the daughter of the lord of the manor. Their moment of ecstasy is as brief and transitory as their desire, and they prove perversely cruel to each other.<br /><br />Born in 1859 in Norway, Knut Hamsun was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920.<br />",3.75,172,Paperback,چاپ دوم,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1388831._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1388831._

In this reappraisal of racial and economic inequality in modern America, Thomas Sugrue explains how Detroit and many other once prosperous industrial cities have become the sites of persistent racialized poverty. He challenges the conventional wisdom that urban decline is the product of the social programs and racial fissures of the 1960s. Probing beneath the veneer of 1950s prosperity and social consensus, Sugrue traces the rise of a new ghetto, solidified by changes in the urban economy and labor market and by racial and class segregation.<br /><br /><br />In this provocative revision of postwar American history, Sugrue finds cities already fiercely divided by race and devastated by the exodus of industries. He focuses on urban neighborhoods, where white working-class homeowners mobilized to prevent integration as blacks tried to move out of the crumbling and overcrowded inner city. Weaving together the history of workplaces, unions, civil rights groups, political organizations, and real estate agencies, Sugrue finds the roots of today's urban poverty in a hidden history of racial violence, discrimination, and deindustrialization that reshaped the American urban landscape after World War II.",4.22, ,Hardcover, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1395794.The_Origins_of_the_Urban_Crisis,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1395794.The_Origins_of_the_Urban_Crisis

She arrives with her young son, desperately in need of time to herself—time to come to terms with her husband's sudden decision to end their marriage. Over the course of the summer, childhood memories come into sharp focus, especially with the reappearance of Travis, the man for whom, when they were both teenagers, she harbored a secret crush. Now, suddenly free, she must decide whether she's ready to take a second chance at love.<br /><br /> More unsettling, however, is the discovery of an unmailed letter written by BJ's grandmother Nonna to BJ's own late mother filled with revelations both startling and confusing. Finding secrets within secrets, BJ begins piecing together the truth of the past.<br /><br /><i>Summers at Blue Lake</i> is an engrossing and rewarding debut novel in the tradition of works by popular novelists such as Elizabeth Berg, Sue Miller, and Anita Shreve.",3.46,323,Paperback, ,47,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1403277.Summers_at_Blue_Lake,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1403277.Summers_at_Blue_Lake

Few deserved it more. The glamorous widow of statesman Averell Harriman had sheltered the Democratic party through a dozen years of exile and had used her late husband's fortune and her own drive to raise $12 million for the party and, ultimately, Clinton's campaign. But long before she became a diplomat, Pamela Harriman had an international reputation - as courtesan of the century. The ambitious eldest child of an English baron, Pamela was eager to flee rural life when her formal education ended at sixteen. Red-haired, voluptuous, and sexy at eighteen, when she claims to have met Adolf Hitler, she married Winston Churchill's only son at the onset of World War II and moved into No. 10 Downing Street. A volatile marriage to Randolph Churchill propelled the seductive young mother into wartime affairs with such powerful men as Harriman, Edward R. Murrow, and top generals on both sides of the Anglo-American alliance. After the war, Pamela divorced, moving to France and into liaisons with wealthy playboys Aly Khan, Gianni Agnelli, and Elie de Rothschild. Her second marriage, to Sound of Music producer Leland Hayward, put her at the crossroads of Broadway and Hollywood in the 1960s. After Hayward's death, a family feud, and a flirtation with Frank Sinatra, she married the seventy-nine-year-old Harriman. The former ambassador, New York governor, and presidential candidate introduced her to a new generation of world leaders as well as Democratic party officials delighted to welcome a beautiful and energetic doyenne. Unauthorized, but based on months of exclusive talks with Pamela Harriman, plus interviews with nearly two hundred friends, relatives, and critics, Life of the Party is the first inside look at the spectacular life and rise of a remarkable woman.",3.72,512,Hardcover, ,29,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1426313.Life_of_the_Party,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1426313.Life_of_the_Party

So, 23-year-old Jennifer decides to pursue peaceful (permanent) oblivion on the beach near her home in Venice, California, drifting on a lethal combination of Xanax and tequila. But she can't even get that right.<br /><br />Jennifer's depression is no match for her Nana's determination. Gabby Zuckerman refuses to let her granddaughter self-destruct. With promises made to Jennifer's father and doctors, Gabby whisks Jennifer back to her home in New York City, intending to prove to Jennifer that her life cannot possibly be over yet. In fact, it has just begun. Through jaunts in Central Park to road trips to Maine, Gabby teaches Jennifer how to trust and hope again. And by relating her own tragic and heroic experience during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Gabby bestows upon Jennifer an understanding of her own life's value. But when Gabby reveals a secret--one that proves to be Jennifer's toughest challenge yet--Jennifer struggles to find out whether the gift will sustain her.<br /><br />Combining the unabashedly heart-warming sentiment of Robert James Waller's <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i> or Nicholas Sparks's <i>Message in a Bottle</i> with the irreverent humor of Jennifer Weiner's <i>In Her Shoes</i>, Goldstein's <i>All That Matters</i> is an inspirational first novel that leads readers to the core of what matters in life--family, hope, and savoring each moment.",3.42,208,Hardcover, ,114,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1441484.All_That_Matters,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1441484.All_That_Matters

A woman is slain in, of all places, the cabin of an airliner in mid flight. A dozen potential witnesses, including the sharply observant Hercule Poirot, are present when the deed is done; yet nobody notices anything amiss until the victim is discovered not to be asleep, as the steward had thought, but cleverly murdered.<br />One great point about Poirot is his ability to judge the true significance of trivia in the light of his special brand of imaginative logic. In no case of Poirot's has his gift been more valuable. Somewhere, among the trifling and apparently inconsequential actions of the passengers, or among the odd assortment of belongings that a search of their baggage reveals, is the key that will begin to make everything clear.<br /><br /><b>Why didn't they ask Evans?</b><br />People had fallen over cliffs before, and at first there seemed to be nothing extraordinary about the accident at Marchbolt. The man was a stranger, and presumably unaware of the perils of the cliff path.<br />There was nothing Bobby could do except wait with him for the help that would surely arrive too late. As he waited, the dying man suddenly spoke. ""Why didn't they ask Evans?""<br />That was all he said; and the words seemed so inconsequential that Bobby did not even mention then at the inquest. Later, when he <i>did</i> report them to mysterious Mr. Cayman, strange and disturbing things began to happen and it began to seem that somebody had powerful reasons for wanting Bobby out of his way. In trying to discover why, Bobby and his friends find themselves involved in something very much more than a simple matter of accidental death.<br /><br /><b>Murder on the Orient Express</b><br />With one mystery successfully concluded, Hercule Poirot is en route from Aleppo to London where his aid on another case is eagerly awaited. but on this occasion the Orient Express does not run strictly according to the international timetable.<br />In the middle of the night, in the heart of Yugoslavia, the train comes to a halt - and next morning it is still halted. A snowdrift is blocking the line ahead; the passengers, with one exception, face the prospect of a wait which could amount to days.<br />The exception lies dead; stabbed not once but over and over again by an apparently frenzied killer. Or was it <i>two</i> killers? That, like the sleeping compartment bolted from the inside, is part of the puzzle Poirot is asked to solve.",4.22,511,Hardcover, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1442912.Agatha_Christie_Crime_Collection,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1442912.Agatha_Christie_Crime_Collection

He was one of the greatest playwrights and short story writers ever born, but he was torn between medicine and literature, as he was between family and friends, between a longing for solitude and a need for company. Donald Rayfield spent more than five years combing the Chekhov archives all over Russia, uncovering thousands of documents and letters from lovers, friends, and family, most of them never published before. They tell of a life far more entangled and turbulent than we ever previously suspected, and in Rayfield's hands allow us to look past Chekhov's restrained, ironic facade to appreciate the full heroism of his brief but prodigiously creative life. Rayfield's biography combines an extraordinarily rich cast of characters -- Gorky, Tolstoy, and Tchaikovsky, to name just three -- with a vivid portrait of Russia and Russian society one hundred years ago. He also delves deeply into the emotions, ideas, conflicts, and experiences that Chekhov transmuted from his life into his enduring art.",4.27,674,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1443009.Anton_Chekhov,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1443009.Anton_Chekhov

She's frightened enough to move in with Detective John LaMoia, a development that doesn't exactly thrill Lou Boldt, their boss and Daphne'sex-lover. But Lou's too busy with his own cases to brood over John and Daphne: the recent disappearances of two local women, and the death of Billy Chen, the nephew of Mama Lu, an old friend and a powerful figure in Seattle's Chinese community, which appeared to be an accident but turns out to have been murder. The only thing the disappearances and murder have in common is location; all three victims were last seen in a part of downtown built over the Underground, a dark and dangerous warren of buildings abandoned after the fire that leveled Seattle more than a hundred years ago.<br /><br /> While Seattle's Underground has been the setting for several mysteries by other authors (Earl Emerson, J.A. Jance), Pearson makes the most of its creepy-crawly atmosphere in a gripping thriller whose solid plotting pulls all of Daphne's, LaMoia's, and Boldt's cases together. It also wisely reconfigures the personal relationships among the three central characters, which bodes well for their future adventures in this long-running series (<i>Middle ofNowhere</i>, <i>The Pied Piper</i>). --Jane Adams",3.78,451,Hardcover,1st Edition,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1452238.The_Art_of_Deception,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1452238.The_Art_of_Deception

But a revolution is a revolution - contingent and sanguinary. In the words of the Russian thinker Alexander Herzen: The death of the contemporary forms of social order ought to gladden rather than trouble the soul. Yet what is frightening is that what the departing world leaves behind it is not an heir but a pregnant widow. Between the death of the one and the birth of the other, much water will flow by, a long night of chaos and desolation will pass. In many senses, including the literal, it was a velvet revolution; but it wasn't bloodless. Nor was it complete. Even today, in 2009, the pregnancy is still in its second trimester. Martin Amis, in <i>The Pregnant Widow</i>, takes as his control experiment a long, hot summer holiday in a castle in Italy, where half a dozen young lives are afloat on the sea change of 1970. The result is a tragicomedy of manners, combining the wit of <i>Money</i> with the historical sense of <i>Time's Arrow</i> and <i>House of Meetings</i>.<br /><br />It was summer 1970 - a long, hot summer. In a castle in Italy, half a dozen young lives are afloat on the sea of change, trapped inside the history of the sexual revolution. The girls are acting like boys, and the boys are going on acting like boys, and Keith Nearing - twenty years old, a literature student all clogged up with the English novel - is struggling to twist feminism and the rise of women towards his own ends. The sexual revolution may have been a velvet revolution (in at least two senses), but it wasn't bloodless - and now, in the twenty-first century, the year 1970 finally catches up with Keith Nearing. ""The Pregnant Widow"" is a comedy of manners and a nightmare, brilliant, haunting and gloriously risque. It is the most eagerly anticipated novel of the year and Martin Amis at his fearless best.<br /><br />About the Author<br /><br />Martin Amis is the author of ten novels, the memoir <i>Experience</i>, two collections of stories and six collections of non-fiction, most recently The Second Plane.

Tim Heald's vivid and elegant biography portrays a woman who was beautiful and sexually alluring—even more so than Princess Diana years later—and whose reputation for naughtiness co-existed with the glamour. The mythology is that Margaret's life was ""ruined"" by her not being allowed to marry the one true love of her life—Group Captain Peter Townsend. Therefore her marriage to Lord Snowdon and her well-attested relationships with Roddy Llewellyn and others were mere consolation prizes. Margaret's often exotic personal life in places like Mustique is a key part of her story. The author received extraordinary help from those closest to Princess Margaret, including her family (Lord Snowdon and her son, Lord Linley), three of her private secretaries, and many of her ladies in waiting; as well as gaining the Queen's permission to use the royal archives. Heald asks why one of the most famous and loved little girls in the world, who became a juvenile wartime sweetheart, ended her life a sad wheelchairbound figure, publicly reviled and ignored.

Today, Brooke is known primarily for <i>The History of Emily Montague, </i> one of the earliest novels about Canada, where she lived for a number of years. But it is her third novel, <i>The Excursion</i>, that is an important example of the fashionable and popular English novels of the late 1770s.<br /><br />Written for the very audience it portrays, this novel introduces the heroine, Maria Villiers, to London's ""gentle"" society and its glittering pastimes. Brooke drew upon the English courtship novel in the tradition of Eliza Haywood, Henry Fielding, and Frances Burney for her novel's overarching plot structure. But instead of concentrating on Maria's romantic adventures, she experiments with unusual treatments of subplots and unconventional characters.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of her story is the development of Maria's ambition to win fame and fortune as a writer; it is one of the few portraits of a woman with literary ambitions by an early woman writer. Brooke's wry narrative voice foreshadows that of Jane Austen.<br /><br />The editors' introduction places <i>The Excursion</i> firmly in the tradition of the English novel, provides a fresh biography of Brooke, and brings together the most important eighteenth- and twentieth-century criticism of Brooke's work.<br /><br />The second volume in the series Eighteenth-Century Novels by Women, <i>The Excursion</i> contributes to our understanding of the development of the novel and offers a lively view of women's position in eighteenth-century English society.",3.17,240,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1461360.Excursion_Pa,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1461360.Excursion_Pa

Mysterious fires erupt in the village with alarming regularity, and a series of petty crimes suggests a darker criminal element at work.

Then, to her amazement, the “coolest girl in the world” moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer’s end they’ve become <i>TullyandKate.</i> Inseparable.<br /><br />So begins Kristin Hannah’s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, <i>Firefly Lane</i> is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.<br /><br />From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. <br /><br />Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn’t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she’ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she’ll envy her famous best friend. . . .<br /><br />For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they’ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.<br /><br /><i>Firefly Lane</i> is for anyone who ever drank Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it’s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It’s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. <i>Firefly Lane </i>is a story you’ll never forget . . . one you’ll want to pass on to your best friend.",4.08,479,Hardcover, ,13759,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1472878.Firefly_Lane,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1472878.Firefly_Lane

Willie expects to be able to hide in the place that has been home to her family for generations, but the monster's death changes the fabric of the quiet, picture-perfect town her ancestors founded. Even further, Willie learns that the story her mother had always told her about her father has all been a lie: he wasn't the random man from a free-love commune that Vi had led her to imagine, but someone else entirely. Someone from this very town. <br /><br />As Willie puts her archaeological skills to work digging for the truth about her lineage, she discovers that the secrets of her family run deep. Through letters, editorials, and journal entries, the dead rise up to tell their sides of the story as dark mysteries come to light, past and present blur, old stories are finally put to rest, and the shocking truth about more than one monster is revealed.",3.61,384,Hardcover, ,2315,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1474628.The_Monsters_of_Templeton,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1474628.The_Monsters_of_Templeton

Their vivid, tightly focused observations of the life of Dublin's poorer classes, their unconventional themes, coarse language, and mention of actual people and places made publishers of the day reluctant to undertake sponsorship.<br /><br />Today, however, the stories are admired for their intense and masterly dissection of ""dear dirty Dublin,"" and for the economy and grace with which Joyce invested this youthful fiction. From ""The Sisters,"" the first story, illuminating a young boy's initial encounter with death, through the final piece, ""The Dead,"" considered a masterpiece of the form, these tales represent, as Joyce himself explained, a chapter in the moral history of Ireland that would give the Irish ""one good look at themselves.""

Then there are a whole host of demons. But no Devil.

But how did a young philosopher-warrior, who ruled for only eighteen months, come to be seen as one of the most potent threats to Christianity?<br /><br />Driven by a burning hatred of the Church, rooted in the brutal murder of his family and the treachery of his Christian predecessor Emperor Constantius II, Julian dedicated his brief reign to the eradication of this new and dangerous cult. He vowed to rid the Roman Empire of heresy and restore paganism to the hearts and minds of its citizens.<br /><br />Although vilified throughout history as the 'Apostate', Julian was an inspirational and visionary leader. He made appointments on merit rather than influence or money, cut down on bureaucracy and had an economic policy geared to avoid corruption and waste. His experiment with paganism may have ultimately failed, but Julian has long been a hero of secular humanists and critics of Christianity's historical record.<br /><br />Drawing on Julian's own writings, and using extensive new archaeological and literary research, Adrian Murdoch explores the vivid, engaging and complex character of this controversial emperor. <i>The Last Pagan</i> will fascinate anyone with an interest in ancient history or the history of Christianity.",3.92,255,Hardcover, ,22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1488113.The_Last_Pagan,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1488113.The_Last_Pagan

But here Thackeray plunders his own past to create the character of Pendennis and the world in which he lives: from miserable schoolboy to striving journalist, from carefree Oxbridge to the high (and low) life of London. The result is a superbly panoramic blend of people, action and background. The true ebb and flow of life is caught and the credibility of Pen, his worldly uncle, the Major, and many of the other characters, extends far beyond the pages of the novel.

Drawing upon literature, strategy, biography, and economics -- plus an inside perspective from the intelligence community -- Derek Leebaert explores what Americans sacrificed at the same time that they achieved the longest great-power peace since Rome fell. Why did they commit so much in wealth and opportunity with so little sustained complaint? Why did the conflict drag on for decades? What did the Cold War do to the country, and how? What was lost while victory was gained? Leebaert has uncovered an astonishing array of never-published documents and information, including major revelations about American covert operations and Soviet military activities. He has found, in the shadows of one of this century's great, epic stories, the sort of details and explanations that hit with the force of a lightning bolt and will change forever the way we think about our past.",3.78, ,Hardcover, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1499377.The_Fifty_Year_Wound,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1499377.The_Fifty_Year_Wound

This charged chapter in the history of African American culture—which came to be known as the Black Arts Movement—has remained largely neglected by subsequent generations of critics. New Thoughts on the Black Arts Movement includes essays that reexamine well-known figures such as Amiri Baraka, Larry Neal, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sonia Sanchez, Betye Saar, Jeff Donaldson, and Haki Madhubuti. In addition, the anthology expands the scope of the movement by offering essays that explore the racial and sexual politics of the era, links with other period cultural movements, the arts in prison, the role of Black colleges and universities, gender politics and the rise of feminism, color fetishism, photography, music, and more. An invigorating look at a movement that has long begged for reexamination, this collection lucidly interprets the complex debates that surround this tumultuous era and demonstrates that the celebration of this movement need not be separated from its critique.",4.19,406,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1511828.New_Thoughts_on_the_Black_Arts_Movement,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1511828.New_Thoughts_on_the_Black_Arts_Movement

Valentine's Day is coming, and Cupid has aimed his arrows at the most unlikely targets. Bestselling fantasy author Bennis Hannaford spots the first direct hit of the season, and she can barely believe her eyes. Stout, comfortable, and long-widowed Hannah Krekorian is bringing home a man. And her tall, silver-haired swain is none other than the best-loved psychology guru of the decade, Paul Hazzard, who coincidentally was once suspected of murdering his wife. Bennis, of course, shares the gossip and the nagging worry taking shape in her fertile mind with her neighbor and best friend, former FBI agent Gregor Demarkian. And Gregor soon uncovers news of his own: The case of who stabbed Jacqueline Hazzard to death four years before is still open and about to hit the tabloids again. Paul Hazzard's former mistress, the elegant Candida DeWitt, has decided to write her tell-all memoirs. The question is: Will she reveal whodunnit to her lover's wife? Or will the murderer decide to do a little book-editing first...in the form of another killing? While someone may be planning a murder, the yen for roses and romance is definitely blooming in a May-December affair between Bennis's brother and an older woman that has all Cavanaugh Street buzzing. But a corpse is in the offing, and the discovery of a body may spoil the mood at the soiree Hannah is giving to introduce her new sweetheart to all the old cronies, eccentric characters, and nosy ladies of the neighborhood. Especially when the body has been stabbed just like poor Mrs. Paul Hazzard's. In Hannah's bedroom. With the murderweapon in grandmotherly Hannah's hand. Nearly sure (at least 90 percent positive) that Hannah is innocent, Bennis and Gregor quickly list their other possible suspects, who include many of Paul's nearest and dearest.

In the 1930s, Pascal's grandfather captured an Italian Jesuit, mistaking him for a giant or a wild beast; the Jesuit in turn converted the tribe. (The Padaung are famous for their giraffe women - so-called because their necks are ritually elongated with ornamental copper rings. Pascal's grandmother had been exhibited in a touring circus in England as a freak).

I don't remember it myself, but people who knew me when I was small say I walked on two feet, just like a human being..."" <br /><br />Ever since he can remember, Animal has gone on all fours, his back twisted beyond repair by the catastrophic events of ""that night"" when a burning fog of poison smoke from the local factory blazed out over the town of Khaufpur, and the Apocalypse visited his slums.

Bound for Baghdad, the steamer Mejidieh was carrying what would prove to be a historically significant load of singular humanity. On board were two of the most important equestrian travellers of the Victorian era - Lord Curzon and Isabella Bird. Though he would later become the most celebrated Viceroy of India, George Curzon had initially made a name for himself by becoming the first Englishman to ride through the remote Pamir mountains of Central Asia. The Long Rider turned politician was now entering Persia to ascertain its political importance to the British Raj. Isabella had already survived so many mounted adventures that the Times of London had dubbed her ""the boldest of travellers."" She was intoxicated with the freedom she discovered on horseback and praised the ""charm of the nomadic life"" she had chosen to lead. The story she weaves in ""Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan"" celebrates the indomitable horse-woman's mounted explorations in this once enchanted portion of the world. It is replete with both the dangers and observations Bird was famed for. Meeting the Shah of Persia by chance, cantering away from ruffians, or wandering the bazaars in disguise were all part of her daily fare. Though her quest for equestrian adventure was to turn her into a compulsive traveller, Isabella's ride across Persia remains a forgotten equestrian travel classic. It is presented in its original two-volume set, complete with delightful drawings.""",3.62, ,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1526326.Journeys_in_Persia_and_Kurdistan_Volume_One,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1526326.Journeys_in_Persia_and_Kurdistan_Volume_One

At its center are vivid portraits of the mocking genius Friedrich Bergmann, the imperious, dazzlingly witty Austrian director, and his disciple, a genial young screenwriter-the fictionalized Christopher Isherwood. <p>When it first appeared in 1945, Prater Violet caused a fury of critical speculation and acclaim. Edmund Wilson called it ""a deliberate historical parable,"" and Diana Trilling's Nation review said, ""Prater Violet is the most charming novel I have read in a long time...

Thirty years later and on the other side of the world, June and Hector are reunited in a plot that will force them to come to terms with the mysterious secrets of their past, and the shocking acts of love and violence that bind them together. <br /><br />As Lee unfurls the stunning story of June, Hector, and Sylvie, he weaves a profound meditation on the nature of heroism and sacrifice, the power of love, and the possibilities for mercy, salvation, and surrendering oneself to another. Combining the complex themes of identity and belonging of Native Speaker and A Gesture Life with the broad range, energy, and pure storytelling gifts of Aloft, Chang-rae Lee has delivered his most ambitious, exciting, and unforgettable work yet. It is a mesmerizing novel, elegantly suspenseful and deeply affecting.",3.66,480,Hardcover, ,723,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1538911.The_Surrendered,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1538911.The_Surrendered

At the same time, he confronts the trauma experienced by Africans in America such as Amadou Diallo. Diawara's experience of life as an African and an African American yields fresh and stunning insights about race, ethnic identity, immigration, and assimilation in the modern globalized world.This important and original book will shatter many cherished notions about what it means to experience race as an African in the world today.

One million people can create new market for a business, spark a social movement, or effect political change. In 1996, a microtrend identified by Penn (""soccer moms"") was crucial in re-electing President Clinton. With years of experience as one of world's most highly regarded pollsters, Mark Penn identifies the new microtrends sweeping the world: <br />*Single women by choice: More often than ever before, they aren't waiting for Mr. Right. They are raising children by themselves and buying their own homes.<br />*Splitters: A growing number of middle-class residents are shuttling between two homes, creating new communities and dynamics in the real estate market.<br />*Sun Haters: Environmentalists, skin cancer survivors, and parents concerned about the impact the sun is having on our health.<br />*Philo-semites: A growing number of people want to date Jewish men and women.<br />*Classical Music Dads: Older men who are fathers in their 40's and 50's and taking on a larger role in the nurturing of their children and becoming an important factor in consumer culture for kids. <br />Penn highlights everything from religion to politics, from leisure pursuits to relationships.

Slechts gewapend met een vergeelde foto gaat hij op zoek naar Augstine, de vrouw die al dan niet een schakel is met zijn grootvader die hij nooit heeft gekend - de vrouw die zijn grootvader, zo is hem verteld, uit de handen van de nazi's heeft gered.<br />Vergezelgd door de onvergetelijke Alex, zijn jonge Oekraïnse gids en tolk die behept is met een komisch spraakverwarrend accent, maakt Jonathan een donquichotachtige zoektocht door een verwoest landschap, terug naar een onverwacht verleden. Verweven door dit verhaal is de roman die de schrijver aan het schrijven is: een betoverende legende over zijn grootvaders dorp, een sjtel, in de Oekraïne, een lappendeken van verbijsterende overeenkomsten die de generaties door de tijd heen verbindt.<br />Gepassioneerd, vol verbeeldingskracht en gekenmerkt door een onuitwisbare humaniteit; Alles is verlicht ontgint de zwarte gaten in de geschiedenis en is uiteindelijk een verhaal over het zoeken naar mensen en plaatsen die niet langer bestaan, naar verborgen waarheden die iedere familie overschaduwen en over de broze, maar noodzakelijke verhalen die verleden en de toekomst met elkaar verbinden.<br /><br />Met Jonathan Safran Foer (USA, 1977) heeft de literatuur er een meesterverteller bij. In zijn eerste roman maken we kennis met de ik-figuur die dezelfde naam draagt als de schrijver, ook zelf schrijft en in de Oekraine op zoek gaat naar een vrouw die zijn grootvader van de Nazi's heeft gered. Al spoedig ontwikkelt zich een vriendschap tussen hem en Alex, zijn Oekraiense tolk. Stukje bij beetje wordt duidelijk welke verschrikkingen zich hier in de oorlog hebben voorgedaan. Dat wil niet zeggen dat dit een zwaarmoedig boek is; integendeel, het boek staat barstensvol komische, dramatische en absurde verhalen die met verbazingwekkende vanzelfsprekendheid worden opgedist, een beetje a la Garcia Marquez. Ook de frequente genrewisselingen - proza, brieven, dromen, dagboek - maken een volstrekt natuurlijke indruk en dragen bij aan de indruk van lichtheid en feestelijkheid die de lezer ondergaat.

Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales.<br /><br />I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. <em>Naughty Neighbor</em> is the eighth in the lineup, and it's presented here in almost original form. Usually when I edit these books I do some modernizing. For instance, I change VHS to DVD, and roller skates to Rollerblades, and sticks of gum are now pieces of gum. I do this because the books were meant to be contemporary (as opposed to historical), and I don't want the reader to have a time disconnect. In the beginning of the original <em>Naughty Neighbo</em>r, my heroine throws a handheld phone into the toilet, and the next morning she goes into the bathroom and sees the ""slim silver antenna caught between the toilet lid and seat."" Okay, so most phones don't have extended antennas anymore, but I just loved the image . . . so I left it in. And I don't know how many women wear front-closure bras anymore, but that got left in, too.<br /><br /><em>Naughty Neighbor</em> is probably the most romancey of all the Loveswepts I wrote, but there's still a small mystery to unravel. Louisa Brannigan is a no-nonsense, hardworking press secretary, fighting her way to the top of Capitol Hill, with no help from her annoying neighbor, Pete Streeter. He receives phone calls all night long, he steals her morning paper, he thinks jeans are formal wear, and worst of all he's involved Louisa in the disappearance of a pig. So this is the story of a pig in Witness Protection and love being found by a workaholic woman and a fun-loving man who makes terrible pots of coffee.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Janet Evanovich",3.65,229,Paperback, ,519,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1577167.Naughty_Neighbor,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1577167.Naughty_Neighbor

The sages share flashes of insight, extraordinary visions, the results of their investigation into consciousness itself.<br /><br />The Upanishads have puzzled and inspired wisdom seekers from Yeats to Schopenhauer. In this best-selling translation, Eknath Easwaran makes these challenging texts more accessible by selecting the passages most relevant to readers seeking timeless truths today. This book includes an overview of the cultural and historical setting, with chapter introductions, notes, and a Sanskrit glossary.

</b><br /><br />Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go — especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil — and also her father.<br /><br />To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings — and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?<br /><br />In this breathtaking sequel to <i>City of Bones</i>, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.",4.16,453,Hardcover,1st Edition,23222,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1582996.City_of_Ashes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1582996.City_of_Ashes

Bush in a sweeping narrative that seamlessly weaves together social, cultural, political, economic, and international developments. We meet the era's many memorable figures and explore the ""culture wars"" between liberals and conservatives that appeared to split the country in two.<br /><br />Patterson describes how America began facing bewildering developments in places such as Panama, Somalia, Bosnia, and Iraq, and discovered that it was far from easy to direct the outcome of global events, and at times even harder for political parties to reach a consensus over what attempts should be made. At the same time, domestic issues such as the persistence of racial tensions, high divorce rates, alarm over crime, and urban decay led many in the media to portray the era as one of decline. Patterson offers a more positive perspective, arguing that, despite our often unmet expectations, we were in many ways better off than we thought. By 2000, most Americans lived more comfortably than they had in the 1970s, and though bigotry and discrimination were far from extinct, a powerful rights consciousness insured that these were less pervasive in American life than at any time in the past.<br /><br />With insightful analyses and engaging prose, <em>Restless Giant</em> captures this period of American history in a way that no other book has, illuminating the road that the United States traveled from the dismal days of the mid-1970s through the hotly contested election of 2000.<br /><br /><strong>The Oxford History of the United States</strong><br /> The Oxford History of the United States is the most respected multi-volume history of our nation. The series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes. <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em> has praised it as ""the most distinguished series in American historical scholarship,"" a series that ""synthesizes a generation's worth of historical inquiry and knowledge into one literally state-of-the-art book."" Conceived under the general editorship of C. Vann Woodward and Richard Hofstadter, and now under the editorship of David M. Kennedy, this renowned series blends social, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, and military history into coherent and vividly written narrative.<br />",3.82,448,Hardcover, ,49,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1584233.Restless_Giant,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1584233.Restless_Giant

First, it reveals the extraordinary and innovative efforts now being made by companies and organizations—and by individuals—to solve problems and save lives both “down the street and around the world.” Then it urges us to seek out what each of us, “regardless of income, available time, age, and skills,” can do to help, to give people a chance to live out their dreams.<br /><br />Bill Clinton shares his own experiences and those of other givers, representing a global flood tide of nongovernmental, nonprofit activity. These remarkable stories demonstrate that gifts of time, skills, things, and ideas are as important and effective as contributions of money. From Bill and Melinda Gates to a six-year-old California girl named McKenzie Steiner, who organized and supervised drives to clean up the beach in her community, Clinton introduces us to both well-known and unknown heroes of giving. Among them:<br /><br />Dr. Paul Farmer, who grew up living in the family bus in a trailer park, vowed to devote his life to giving high-quality medical care to the poor and has built innovative public health-care clinics first in Haiti and then in Rwanda;<br />a New York couple, in Africa for a wedding, who visited several schools in Zimbabwe and were appalled by the absence of textbooks and school supplies. They founded their own organization to gather and ship materials to thirty-five schools. After three years, the percentage of seventh-graders who pass reading tests increased from 5 percent to 60 percent;'<br />Oseola McCarty, who after seventy-five years of eking out a living by washing and ironing, gave $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi to endow a scholarship fund for African-American students;<br />Andre Agassi, who has created a college preparatory academy in the Las Vegas neighborhood with the city’s highest percentage of at-risk kids. “Tennis was a stepping-stone for me,” says Agassi. “Changing a child’s life is what I always wanted to do”;<br />Heifer International, which gave twelve goats to a Ugandan village. Within a year, Beatrice Biira’s mother had earned enough money selling goat’s milk to pay Beatrice’s school fees and eventually to send all her children to school—and, as required, to pass on a baby goat to another family, thus multiplying the impact of the gift.<br /><br />Clinton writes about men and women who traded in their corporate careers, and the fulfillment they now experience through giving. He writes about energy-efficient practices, about progressive companies going green, about promoting fair wages and decent working conditions around the world. He shows us how one of the most important ways of giving can be an effort to change, improve, or protect a government policy. He outlines what we as individuals can do, the steps we can take, how much we should consider giving, and why our giving is so important.<br /><br />Bill Clinton’s own actions in his post-presidential years have had an enormous impact on the lives of millions. Through his foundation and his work in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, he has become an international spokesperson and model for the power of giving.<br /><br />“We all have the capacity to do great things,” President Clinton says. “My hope is that the people and stories in this book will lift spirits, touch hearts, and demonstrate that citizen activism and service can be a powerful agent of change in the world.”",3.46,240,Hardcover, ,434,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1593813.Giving,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1593813.Giving

For mainlanders unaware of the racial issues in that apparent island paradise, Trask's work is an eye-opener. In heavily cadenced, musical language, Trask explores the social realities affecting Native Hawaiians today, from youthful suicide to loss of language, from verbal racism to physical violence. But there is also in her work a deep connection to the islands' beautiful, ocean-ringed land and to the sustaining strengths of family and of love. Fierce words from a woman known for her dedication to her people.""-<i>Booklist</i><br /><br />""<i>Light In The Crevice Never Seen</i> is the first volume of poetry ever published by an indigenous Hawaiian in the mainland US. For a debut collection, it is extraordinarily angry. An activist and an academic, Trask resents what she sees as the subjugation of Hawaii by the Japanese and the Americans, and she is deeply chagrined at the development of tourism, which she believes to have accelerated the decay of native island culture and language. While her view of Hawaiian history and politics will be of interest to outsiders unfamiliar with the islands and while Eleanor Wilners concise introduction helps put many of these issues into sharp focus for the reader few who are not already sympathizers will be moved by Trasks shrill, two-dimensional verse, which amounts to a kind of Polynesian agitprop.""-<i>Kirkus</i>",3.97,144,Paperback, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1597120.Light_in_the_Crevice_Never_Seen_Revised_Edition,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1597120.Light_in_the_Crevice_Never_Seen_Revised_Edition

So argues Robert Jensen in <i>Getting Off: Pornography and the End of Masculinity</i>. Jensen’s treatise begins with a simple demand: “Be a man.” It ends with a defiant response: “I chose to struggle to be a human being.” The journey from masculinity to humanity is found in the candid and intelligent exploration of porn’s devastating role in defining masculinity.<br /><br /><i>Getting Off</i> seamlessly blends personal anecdotes from Jensen’s years as a feminist anti-pornography activist with scholarly research. In his trademark conversational style, he shows how mainstream pornography reinforces social definitions of manhood and influences men’s attitudes about women and how to treat them.<br /><br />Pornography is a thriving multi-billion-dollar industry; it drives the direction of emerging media technology. Pornography also makes for complicated politics. These days, anti-porn arguments are assumed to be “anti-sex” and thus a critical debate is silenced. This book breaks that silence. Alarming and thought-provoking, <i>Getting Off</i> asks tough, but crucial, questions about pornography, sex, manhood, and the way toward genuine social justice.<br /><br /><b>Robert Jensen</b> is an associate professor in the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin.

Partiendo de la tradicion francesa de comedia de boulevard y de vodevil, basada en equivocos, gags, situaciones paradojicas y falsas identidades, Fo introduce su personal bagaje, extraido de la comedia popular italiana, creando un nuevo genero de farsa surrealista, llena de personajes delirantes, ladrones y pintores, taxistas y embajadores, viudas consoladas y cadaveres viajeros, en un carrusel disparatado de situaciones, capaz de suscitar la sonrisa mas sutil, malvada y duradera.

The results come back positive, putting her at a terrifyingly elevated risk of developing breast cancer before the age of fifty and ovarian cancer in her lifetime. Thirty-four, unattached, and yearning for marriage and a family of her own, Queller faces an agonizing choice: a lifetime of vigilant screenings and a commitment to fight the disease when caught, or its radical alternative—a prophylactic double mastectomy that would effectively restore life to her, even as it would challenge her most closely held beliefs about body image, identity, and sexuality. <br /><br />Superbly informed and armed with surprising wit and style, Queller takes us on an odyssey from the frontiers of science to the private interiors of a woman’s life. <i>Pretty Is What Changes</i> is an absorbing account of how she reaches her courageous decision and its physical, emotional, and philosophical consequences. It is also an incredibly moving story of what we inherit from our parents and how we fashion it into the stuff of our own lives, of mothers and daughters and sisters, and of the sisterhood that forms when women are united in battle against a common enemy. <br /><br />Without flinching, Jessica Queller answers a question we may one day face for ourselves: If genes can map our fates and their dark knowledge is offered to us, will we willingly trade innocence for the information that could save our lives?</p>",4.03,256,Hardcover, ,112,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1615224.Pretty_is_What_Changes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1615224.Pretty_is_What_Changes

But the world has also left its mark on him. ""Hammering Hank"" Aaron's story is one that tells us much about baseball, naturally, but also about our times. His unique, poignant life has made him a symbol for much of the social history of twentieth-century America.<br /><br />Raised during the Depression in the Deep South enclave of Mobile, Alabama, Aaron broke into professional baseball as a cross-handed slugger and shortstop for the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro American League. A year later, he and a few others had the unforgettable mission of integrating the South Atlantic League. A year after that, he was a timid rookie leftfielder for the Milwaukee Braves, for whom he became a World Series hero in 1957 as well as the MostValuable Player of the National League.<br /><br />Aaron found himself back in the South when the Braves moved to Atlanta in 1965. Nine years later, in the heat of hatred and controversy, he hit his 715th home run to break Ruth's and baseball's most cherished record--a feat that was recently voted the greatest moment in baseball history. That year, Aaron received over 900,000 pieces of mail, many of them vicious and racially charged.<br /><br />In a career that may be the most consistent baseball has ever seen. Aaron also set all-time records for total bases and RBIs. He ended his playing days by spending two nostalgic seasons back in Milwaukee with the Brewers, then embarked on a new career as an executive with the Atlanta Braves. He was for a long time the highest-ranking black in baseball. In this position, Aaron has become an unofficial spokesman in racial matters pertaining to the national pastime.<br /><br />Because of the depth and pertinence of Aaron's dramatic experiences, <em>I Had A Hammer</em> is more than a baseball autobiography. Henry Aaron's candor and insights have produced a revealing book about his extraordinary life and time.",4.07,480,Paperback, ,31,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1624959.I_Had_a_Hammer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1624959.I_Had_a_Hammer
