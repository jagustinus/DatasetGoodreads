But his readers had an urgent follow-up question: What about technology in our personal lives?<br /><br />In recent years, our culture's relationship with personal technology has transformed from something exciting into something darker. Innovations like smartphones and social media are useful, but many of us are increasingly troubled by how much control these tools seem to exert over our daily experiences--including how we spend our free time and how we feel about ourselves.<br /><br />In Digital Minimalism, Newport proposes a bold solution: a minimalist approach to technology use in which you radically reduce the time you spend online, focusing on a small set of carefully-selected activities while happily ignoring the rest.<br /><br />He mounts a vigorous defense for this less-is-more approach, combining historical examples with case studies of modern digital minimalists to argue that this philosophy isn't a rejection of technology, but instead a necessary realignment to ensure that these tools serve us, not the other way around.<br /><br />To make these principles practical, he takes us inside the growing subculture of digital minimalists who have built rich lives on a foundation of intentional technology use, and details a decluttering process that thousands have already used to simplify their online lives. He also stresses the importance of never clicking ""like,"" explores the underappreciated value of analog hobbies, and draws lessons from the ""attention underground""--a resistance movement fighting the tech companies' attempts to turn us into gadget addicts.<br /><br />Digital Minimalism is an indispensable guide for anyone looking to reclaim their life from the alluring diversions of the digital world.",4.07,304,Hardcover, ,411,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40405444-digital-minimalism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40405444-digital-minimalism

And this may sound weirdly obvious, but every single one of those pieces of software was written by a programmer. Programmers are thus among the most quietly influential people on the planet. As we live in a world made of software, they're the architects. The decisions they make guide our behavior. When they make something newly easy to do, we do a lot more of it. If they make it hard or impossible to do something, we do less of it.<br /><br />If we want to understand how today's world works, we ought to understand something about coders. Who exactly are the people that are building today's world? What makes them tick? What type of personality is drawn to writing software? And perhaps most interestingly -- what does it do to them?<br /><br />One of the first pieces of coding a newbie learns is the program to make the computer say ""Hello, world!"" Like that piece of code, Clive Thompson's book is a delightful place to begin to understand this vocation, which is both a profession and a way of life, and which essentially didn't exist little more than a generation ago, but now is considered just about the only safe bet we can make about what the future holds. Thompson takes us close to some of the great coders of our time, and unpacks the surprising history of the field, beginning with the first great coders, who were women. Ironically, if we're going to traffic in stereotypes, women are arguably ""naturally"" better at coding than men, but they were written out of the history, and shoved out of the seats, for reasons that are illuminating. Now programming is indeed, if not a pure brotopia, at least an awfully homogenous community, which attracts people from a very narrow band of backgrounds and personality types. As Thompson learns, the consequences of that are significant - not least being a fetish for disruption at scale that doesn't leave much time for pondering larger moral issues of collateral damage. At the same time, coding is a marvelous new art form that has improved the world in innumerable ways, and Thompson reckons deeply, as no one before him has, with what great coding in fact looks like, who creates it, and where they come from. To get as close to his subject has he can, he picks up the thread of his own long-abandoned coding practice, and tries his mightiest to up his game, with some surprising results.<br /><br />More and more, any serious engagement with the world demands an engagement with code and its consequences, and to understand code, we must understand coders. In that regard, Clive Thompson's <i>Hello, World! </i>is a marvelous and delightful master class.",4.03,448,Hardcover, ,190,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40406806-coders,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40406806-coders

  <b>A rich and rollicking first novel from one of America's most beloved and widely acclaimed nature writers, Robert Michael Pyle</b>
</p><br /> <br /><p>In <i>Magdalena Mountain</i>, Robert Michael Pyle's first and long-awaited novel, the award-winning naturalist proves he is at home in an imagined landscape as he is in the natural one. At the center of this story of majesty and magic in the natural world are three Magdalenas—Mary, a woman whose uncertain journey opens the book; Magdalena Mountain, shrouded in mystery and menace; and the all-black <i>Magdalena Alpine</i> butterfly, the most elusive of several rare and beautiful species found on the mountain.</p><br /> <br /><p>And high in the Colorado Rocky Mountain wilderness, sharing the remote territory of the <i>Magdalena</i> butterfly, lives the enigmatic Oberon, a reluctant de facto leader of The Grove, a diverse community of monks who share a devotion to Nature. Converging in the same wilderness are October Carson, a beachcomber-wanderer in pursuit of the alpine butterflies he collects for museums; James Mead, a young graduate student intent upon learning the ecology of this seductive creature; and the enigmatic Mary Glanville, who also seeks the butterfly but can't remember why.</p><br /> <br /><p>While the mystery surrounding Mary takes a menacing turn, their shared quest pulls them deeper into the high mountain wilderness culminating in a harrowing encounter on the stony slopes of Magdalena Mountain.</p><br /> <br /><p>

  <i>Those are the numbers. This is how it feels…</i>

When he was almost fifty years old, Tomlinson weighed an astonishing—and dangerous—460 pounds, at risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke, unable to climb a flight of stairs without having to catch his breath, or travel on an airplane without buying two seats. Raised in a family that loved food, he had been aware of the problem for years, seeing doctors and trying diets from the time he was a preteen. But nothing worked, and every time he tried to make a change, it didn’t go the way he planned—in fact, he wasn’t sure that he really wanted to change.<br /><br />In <i>The Elephant in the Room</i>, Tomlinson chronicles his lifelong battle with weight in a voice that combines the urgency of Roxane Gay’s <i>Hunger </i>with the intimacy of Rick Bragg’s <i>All Over but the Shoutin’</i>. He also hits the road to meet other members of the plus-sized tribe in an attempt to understand how, as a nation, we got to this point. From buying a FitBit and setting exercise goals to contemplating the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas, America’s “capital of food porn,” and modifying his own diet, Tomlinson brings us along on a candid and sometimes brutal look at the everyday experience of being constantly aware of your size. Over the course of the book, he confronts these issues head-on and chronicles the practical steps he has to take—big and small—to lose weight by the end.<br /><br />Affecting and searingly honest, <i>The Elephant in the Room </i>is a powerful memoir that will resonate with anyone who has grappled with addiction, shame, or self-consciousness.

Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.<br /><br />An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.<br /><br />What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. <br /><br />They succeeded by transforming habits.<br /><br />In <i>The Power of Habit, </i>award-winning <i>New York Times</i> business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. <br /><br />Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<br /><br />At its core, <i>The Power of Habit</i> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. <br /><br />Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.",4.11,405,Kindle Edition, ,196,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40488122-the-power-of-habit,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40488122-the-power-of-habit

  <b>Real marketing isn't about racking up clicks and tweets; it's about connection, empathy, and making a difference.</b>
</b><br /><br />Over the past quarter century, Seth Godin has taught and inspired millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, leaders, and fans from all walks of life, via his blog, online courses, lectures, and bestselling books. He is the inventor of countless ideas and phrases that have made their way into mainstream business language, from Permission Marketing to Purple Cow to Tribes to The Dip. <br /><br />Now, for the first time, Godin offers the core of his marketing wisdom in one accessible, timeless package. At the heart of his approach is a big idea: Great marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems. They don't just make noise; they make the world better. Truly powerful marketing is grounded in empathy, generosity, and emotional labor. <br /><br />This book teaches you how to identify your smallest viable audience; draw on the right signals and signs to position your offering; build trust and permission with your target market; speak to the narratives your audience tells themselves about status, affiliation, and dominance; spot opportunities to create and release tension; and give people the tools to achieve their goals. <br /><br />It's time for marketers to stop lying, spamming, and feeling guilty about their work. It's time to stop confusing social media metrics with true connections. It's time to stop wasting money on stolen attention that won't pay off in the long run. THIS IS MARKETING offers a better approach that will still apply for decades to come, no matter how the tactics of marketing continue to evolve.",4.04,288,Kindle Edition, ,30,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40510807-this-is-marketing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40510807-this-is-marketing

It is a story of imagination, deception, and art that spotlights today’s most brilliant young magicians—a mysterious club known as the52, who are revolutionizing an ancient artform under the mantra Magic Is Dead.<br /><br />Ian brings us with him as he not only gets to know this fascinating world, but also becomes an integral part of it. We meet the52’s founding members—Laura London, Daniel Madison, and Chris Ramsay—and explore their personal demons, professional aspirations, and what drew them to their craft. We join them at private gatherings of the most extraordinary magicians working today, follow them to magic conventions in Las Vegas and England, and discover some of the best tricks of the trade. We also encounter David Blaine; hang out with Penn Jillette; meet Dynamo, the U.K.’s most famous magician; and go behind the scenes of a Netflix magic show. <em>Magic Is Dead</em> is also a chronicle of magic’s rich history and how it has changed in the internet age, as the young guns embrace social media and move away from the old-school take on the craft.<br /><br />As he tells the story of the52, and his role as its most unlikely member, Ian reveals his own connection with trickery and deceit and how he first learned the elements that make magic work from his poker-playing mother. He recalls their adventures in card rooms and casinos after his father’s sudden death, and shares a touching moment that he had, as a working journalist, with his childhood idol Shaquille O’Neal.<br /><br />“Magic—the romanticism of the inexplicable, the awe and admiration of the unexpected—is an underlying force in how we view the world and its myriad possibilities,” Ian writes. As his journey continues, Ian not only becomes a performer and creator of magic—even fooling the late Anthony Bourdain during a chance encounter—he also cements a new brotherhood, and begins to understand his relationship with his father, fifteen years after his death. Written with psychological acuity and a keen eye for detail, <em>Magic Is Dead</em> is an engrossing tale full of wonder and surprise.",3.68,336,Hardcover, ,68,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40535664-magic-is-dead,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40535664-magic-is-dead

Until the arrival of European explorers they were the only people to have ever lived there. Both the most closely related and the most widely dispersed people in the world before the era of mass migration, Polynesians can trace their roots to a group of epic voyagers who ventured out into the unknown in one of the greatest adventures in human history.<br /><br />How did the earliest Polynesians find and colonize these far-flung islands? How did a people without writing or metal tools conquer the largest ocean in the world? This conundrum, which came to be known as the Problem of Polynesian Origins, emerged in the eighteenth century as one of the great geographical mysteries of mankind.<br /><br />For Christina Thompson, this mystery is personal: her Maori husband and their sons descend directly from these ancient navigators. In <em>Sea People</em>, Thompson explores the fascinating story of these ancestors, as well as those of the many sailors, linguists, archaeologists, folklorists, biologists, and geographers who have puzzled over this history for three hundred years. A masterful mix of history, geography, anthropology, and the science of navigation, Sea People combines the thrill of exploration with the drama of discovery in a vivid tour of one of the most captivating regions in the world.<br /><br /><em>Sea People</em> includes an 8-page photo insert, illustrations throughout, and 2 endpaper maps.",4.20,384,Hardcover, ,282,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40536236-sea-people,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40536236-sea-people

The disaster not only changed the world’s perception of nuclear power and the science that spawned it, but also our understanding of the planet’s delicate ecology. With the images of the abandoned homes and playgrounds beyond the barbed wire of the 30-kilometer Exclusion Zone, the rusting graveyards of contaminated trucks and helicopters, the farmland lashed with black rain, the event fixed for all time the notion of radiation as an invisible killer.<br /><br />Chernobyl was also a key event in the destruction of the Soviet Union, and, with it, the United States’ victory in the Cold War. For Moscow, it was a political and financial catastrophe as much as an environmental and scientific one.

But, above all else, Tim Kreider is an essayist—one whose deft prose, uncanny observations, dark humor, and emotional vulnerability have earned him deserved comparisons to David Sedaris, Sarah Vowell, and the late David Foster Wallace (who was himself a fan of Kreider’s humor).<br /> <br />“Beautifully written, with just enough humor to balance his spikiness” (<i>Booklist</i>), <i>I Wrote This Book Because I Love You</i> focuses Tim’s unique perception and wit on his relationships with women—romantic, platonic, and the murky in-between. He talks about his difficulty finding lasting love and seeks to understand his commitment issues by tracking down the John Hopkins psychologist who tested him for a groundbreaking study on attachment when he was a toddler. He talks about his valued female friendships, one of which landed him on a circus train bound for Mexico. He talks about his time teaching young women at an upstate New York college, and the profound lessons they wound up teaching him. And in a hugely popular essay that originally appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, he talks about his nineteen-year-old cat, wondering if it’s the most enduring relationship he’ll ever have.<br /> <br />“In a style reminiscent of Orwell, E.B. White and David Sedaris” (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), each of these pieces is “heartbreaking, brutal, and hilarious” (Judd Apatow), and collectively they cement Kreider’s place among the best essayists working today.",4.23,224,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40538730-i-wrote-this-book-because-i-love-you,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40538730-i-wrote-this-book-because-i-love-you

Lost. Stuck in a daily grind of overflowing calendars, grueling small talk, and sprawling traffic. She’d done everything “right,” but she felt all wrong. What’s the worse failure, she wondered: smiling and staying the course, or blowing it all up and running away? And are those the only options?<br /> <br /> In this memoir-in-essays full of spot-on observations about home, work, and creative life, Philpott takes on the conflicting pressures of modern adulthood with wit and heart. She offers up her own stories to show that identity crises don’t happen just once or only at midlife; reassures us that small, recurring personal re-inventions are both normal and necessary; and advises that if you’re going to faint, you should get low to the ground first. Most of all, Philpott shows that when you stop feeling satisfied with your life, you don’t have to burn it all down and set off on a transcontinental hike (unless you want to, of course). You can call upon your many selves to figure out who you are, who you’re not, and where you belong.

  <b>An emotional, revealing memoir of one family’s life in seclusion—and the love, strength, and faith it took to save it.</b>
</p><p>Seahawks star running back Curt Warner and his wife, Ana, were prominent figures in Seattle in the early 1990s. When they dropped from the public eye after Curt’s retirement, everyone assumed it was for a simpler life. But the reality behind their seclusion was a secret they hid from even their closest friends: their twins, Austin and Christian, had been diagnosed with severe autism. What followed was a painful struggle to hold their family and their marriage together in a home filled with chaos, emotional exhaustion, and constant fear for the safety of their unpredictable but beloved boys.</p><p>Now, after years of silence, the Warners share their inspiring journey from stardom and success to heartbreaking self-imposed isolation. Above all, it’s a story of the life-changing truth that love for family and each other—no matter how challenged—is the path to healing and peace.</p><p><i>The Warner Boys</i> is the true story of a family who fought for their children and how they grew stronger against all odds.</p>",4.24,193,Kindle Edition, ,292,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40552513-the-warner-boys,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40552513-the-warner-boys

Among others, we meet a man who as a teenager killed a rival gang member and twenty years later is still trying to come to terms with what he's done; a devoted school social worker struggling with her favorite student, who refuses to give evidence in the shooting death of his best friend; the witness to a wrongful police shooting who can't shake what he has seen; and an aging former gang leader who builds a place of refuge for himself and his friends.<br /> Applying the close-up, empathic reporting that made <i>There Are No Children Here</i> a modern classic, Kotlowitz offers a piercingly honest portrait of a city in turmoil.

In <i>The Third Pillar</i> he offers up a magnificent big-picture framework for understanding how these three forces--the state, markets, and our communities--interact, why things begin to break down, and how we can find our way back to a more secure and stable plane.<br /><br />The ""third pillar"" of the title is the community we live in. Economists all too often understand their field as the relationship between markets and the state, and they leave squishy social issues for other people. That's not just myopic, Rajan argues; it's dangerous. All economics is actually socioeconomics - all markets are embedded in a web of human relations, values and norms. As he shows, throughout history, technological phase shifts have ripped the market out of those old webs and led to violent backlashes, and to what we now call populism. Eventually, a new equilibrium is reached, but it can be ugly and messy, especially if done wrong.<br /><br />Right now, we're doing it wrong. As markets scale up, the state scales up with it, concentrating economic and political power in flourishing central hubs and leaving the periphery to decompose, figuratively and even literally. Instead, Rajan offers a way to rethink the relationship between the market and civil society and argues for a return to strengthening and empowering local communities as an antidote to growing despair and unrest. Rajan is not a doctrinaire conservative, so his ultimate argument that decision-making has to be devolved to the grass roots or our democracy will continue to wither, is sure to be provocative. But even setting aside its solutions, <i>The Third Pillar </i>is a masterpiece of explication, a book that will be a classic of its kind for its offering of a wise, authoritative and humane explanation of the forces that have wrought such a sea change in our lives.",3.88,464,Hardcover, ,78,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40594595-the-third-pillar,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40594595-the-third-pillar

Just as she did in <i>Clementine</i>, Sonia Purnell uncovers the captivating story of a powerful, influential, yet shockingly overlooked heroine of the Second World War. At a time when sending female secret agents into enemy territory was still strictly forbidden, Virginia Hall came to be known as the ""Madonna of the Resistance,"" coordinating a network of spies to blow up bridges, report on German troop movements, arrange equipment drops for Resistance agents, and recruit and train guerilla fighters. Even as her face covered WANTED posters throughout Europe, Virginia refused order after order to evacuate. She finally escaped with her life in a grueling hike over the Pyrenees into Spain, her cover blown, and her associates all imprisoned or executed. But, adamant that she had ""more lives to save,"" she dove back in as soon as she could, organizing forces to sabotage enemy lines and back up Allied forces landing on Normandy beaches.

We see software coders become millionaires or billionaires before age thirty and feel we are failing if we are not one of them.<br /><br />Late bloomers, on the other hand, are undervalued in popular culture by educators and employers, and even unwittingly by parents. Yet the fact is, a lot of us - most of us - do not explode out of the gates in life. We have to discover our passions and talents and gifts. That was true for author Rich Karlgaard, who had a mediocre academic career at Stanford (which he got into by a fluke) and, after graduating, worked as a dishwasher and nightwatchman before finally finding the inner motivation and drive that ultimately led him to start up a high-tech magazine in Silicon Valley, and eventually to become the publisher of <i>Forbes</i> magazine.<br /><br />There is a scientific explanation for why so many of us bloom later in life. The executive function of our brains doesn't mature until age twenty-five - and later for some. In fact, our brain's capabilities peak at different ages. We actually experience multiple periods of blooming in our lives. Moreover, late bloomers enjoy hidden strengths due to taking the time to discover their way in life - strengths coveted by many employers and partners, including curiosity, insight, compassion, resilience, and wisdom.<br /><br />Based on years of research, personal experience, interviews with neuroscientists, psychologists, and countless people at different stages of their careers, <i>Late Bloomers</i> reveals how and when we achieve our full potential, and why today's focus on early success is so misguided, and even harmful.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>Late Bloomers</i></b><br /><br />""The underlying message that we should 'consider a kinder clock for human development' is a compelling one.""<b>--</b><i>

A fissure is growing between the parents, one the children can feel beneath their feet. They are led, inexorably, to a grand, unforgettable adventure--both in the harsh desert landscape, and within the chambers of their own imaginations.<br />     Told through the voices of the mother, her son, as well as through a stunning tapestry of collected texts and images--including prior stories of migration and displacement--<i>Lost Children Archive</i> is a story of how we document our experiences, and how we remember the things that matter to us the most. Blending the personal and political with astonishing empathy, it is a powerful, wholly original work of fiction: exquisite, provocative, and deeply moving.",3.85,401,Kindle Edition, ,122,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40624441-lost-children-archive,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40624441-lost-children-archive

For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor walk-up apartment with some surprisingly verbal vegetation. And then there's the gingerbread they make.

In fact, the world's truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread is Harriet's charismatic childhood friend, Gretel Kercheval--a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met.<br /><br />Decades later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother's long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet's story. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value.

If you’re like most people, chances are you react with fear and confusion, falling back on timeworn strategies: anger, self-judgment, and addictive behaviors. Though these old, conditioned attempts to control our life may offer fleeting relief, ultimately they leave us feeling isolated and mired in pain.<br />  <br /> There <i>is</i> another way. Beneath the turbulence of our thoughts and emotions exists a profound stillness, a silent awareness capable of limitless love. Tara Brach, author of the award-winning <i>Radical Acceptance, </i>calls this awareness our true refuge, because it is available to every one of us, at any moment, no exceptions. In this book, Brach offers a practical guide to finding our inner sanctuary of peace and wisdom in the midst of difficulty.<br />  <br /> Based on a fresh interpretation of the three classic Buddhist gateways to freedom—truth, love, and awareness—<i>True Refuge</i> shows us the way not just to heal our suffering, but also to cultivate our capacity for genuine happiness. Through spiritual teachings, guided meditations, and inspirational stories of people who discovered loving presence during times of great struggle, Brach invites us to connect more deeply with our own inner life, one another, and the world around us.<br /><i> </i><br /><i>True Refuge</i> is essential reading for anyone encountering hardship or crisis, anyone dedicated to a path of spiritual awakening. The book reminds us of our own innate intelligence and goodness, making possible an enduring trust in ourselves and our lives. We realize that what we seek is within us, and regardless of circumstances, “there is always a way to take refuge in a healing and liberating presence.”<br /><br /><b>Advance praise for <i>True Refuge</i></b><br />  <br /> “Tara Brach writes from the heart to the heart. With candor and calmness, she shares her own and others’ struggles to overcome our deep and constant human dilemmas. Whenever I read Brach, I feel more peaceful and hopeful. I trust myself and the universe more. I feel more connected and grounded in what the Lakota Sioux call Wakan Tanka, The Great Mystery. <i>True Refuge</i> is itself a refuge and I thank the author for it.”—Mary Pipher, Ph.D., <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Green Boat</i> and <i>Reviving Ophelia</i><br />  <br /> “There is something very special about this exquisitely written book—its clarity, beauty, simplicity, and humanity practically sing to you. Inspiring and uplifting to read, it also has eminently practical, implementable, step-by-step guidance to practice and live by. And the fifteen brief, powerful guided meditations offer an easy, gentle entry toward inner peace and wisdom.

Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.<br /><br />In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.<br /><br />Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience ""fear of missing out"" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.<br /><br />Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.<br /><br />Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day ""digital declutter"" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.<br /><br />Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you.

Now Eliza embarks on the trip of a lifetime, home with Sofya to see the splendors of Russia: the church with the interior covered in jeweled mosaics, the Rembrandts at the Tsar's Winter Palace, the famous ballet. But when Austria declares war on Serbia and Russia's Imperial dynasty begins to fall, Eliza escapes back to America, while Sofya and her family flee to their estate outside the city. In need of domestic help, they hire the local fortuneteller's daughter, Varinka, unknowingly bringing intense danger into their home. On the other side of the Atlantic, Eliza is doing her part to help the White Russian families find safety as they escape the revolution. But when Sofya's letters suddenly stop coming she fears the worst for her best friend.<br /><br />From the turbulent streets of St. Petersburg and aristocratic estates of the countryside to the avenues of Paris and the society of fallen Russian émigrés there to the mansions of Long Island, the lives of Eliza, Sofya, and Varinka will intersect in profound ways, taking readers on a breathtaking ride through a momentous time in history.",4.01,448,Kindle Edition, ,297,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40753481-lost-roses,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40753481-lost-roses

Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, Dawsey Adams, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name in a book?<br /><br />As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of Dawsey and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i>—a book club born as a spur-of-the- moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts an outstanding cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.<br /><br />Juliet begins a remarkable conversation in letters with the Society’s members, learning about their lives, their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on all of them. Over time, and despite a demanding and dramatic life in London, she finds herself drawn to the self-contained Dawsey Adams, and to the story of Elizabeth, a young woman whose bright spirit and strength live on in the daughter she left behind when she was sent to a concentration camp. Juliet knows she has found the subject of her book, and possibly much more, and sets sail for Guernsey, changing the course of her life forever.<br /><br />A celebration of the written word in all its guises, <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i> is the debut novel by the aunt-and-niece team of Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows.",4.17,322,Kindle Edition,Netflix tie-in edition,1011,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40787340-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40787340-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society

But the leader of the Bolshevik army is after them, and he’s hunted Romanov before.</p><p>Nastya’s only chances of saving herself and her family are either to release the spell and deal with the consequences, or to enlist help from Zash, the handsome soldier who doesn’t act like the average Bolshevik.

</b><br /><br />Four and Nine are partners, working for the same company, sent without passports to a nation recovering from ten years of civil war. Together, operating under pseudonyms and anonymous to potential kidnappers, they are given a new machine, the RS-80, and tasked with building a highway that connects the country's far-flung villages with the capital. Four, nicknamed ""The Clock,"" is one of the highway's most experienced operators, never falling short of his assigned schedule. He drives the RS-80, stopping only to sleep and eat the food provided by the company. But Nine is an agent of chaos: speeding ahead on his vehicle, chatting and joking with locals, eating at nearby bars and roadside food stands, he threatens the schedule, breaks protocol, and endangers the work that they must complete in time for a planned government parade. His every action draws Four's ire, but when illness, corruption, and theft compromise their high-stakes mission, Four and Nine discover danger far greater than anything they could pose to one another.",3.63,192,Hardcover, ,523,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40819224-the-parade,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40819224-the-parade

</b><br /><br />Joel Golby's writing for <i>Vice</i> and <i>The Guardian, </i> with its wry observation and naked self-reflection, has brought him a wide and devoted following. Now, in his first book, he presents a blistering collection of new and newly expanded essays--including the achingly funny viral hit ""Things You Only Know When Both Your Parents Are Dead."" In these pages, he travels to Saudi Arabia, where he acts as a perplexed bystander at a camel pageant; offers a survival guide for the modern dinner party (i.e. how to tactfully escape at the first sign of an adult board game); and gets pitted head-to-head, again and again, with an unpredictable, unpitying subspecies of Londoner: the landlord.<br /><br />Through it all, he shows that no matter how cruel the misfortune, how absurd the circumstance, there's always the soft punch of a lesson tucked within. This is a book for anyone who overshares, overthinks, has ever felt lost or confused--and who wants to have a good laugh about it.",3.65,304,Paperback, ,92,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40819522-brilliant-brilliant-brilliant-brilliant-brilliant,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40819522-brilliant-brilliant-brilliant-brilliant-brilliant

Stack, a stunning memoir of raising her children abroad with the help of Chinese and Indian women who are also working mothers</b><br /><br />When Megan Stack was living in Beijing, she left her prestigious job as a foreign correspondent to have her first child and work from home writing a book. She quickly realized that caring for a baby and keeping up with the housework while her husband went to the office each day was consuming the time she needed to write. This dilemma was resolved in the manner of many upper-class families and large corporations: she availed herself of cheap Chinese labor. The housekeeper Stack hired was a migrant from the countryside, a mother who had left her daughter in a precarious situation to earn desperately needed cash in the capital. As Stack's family grew and her husband's job took them to Delhi, a series of Chinese and Indian women cooked, cleaned, and babysat in her home. Stack grew increasingly aware of the brutal realities of their lives: domestic abuse, alcoholism, unplanned pregnancies. Hiring poor women had given her the ability to work while raising her children, but what ethical compromise had she made?<br /><br />Determined to confront the truth, Stack traveled to her employees' homes, met their parents and children, and turned a journalistic eye on the tradeoffs they'd been forced to make as working mothers seeking upward mobility<b>--</b>and on the cost to the children who were left behind.<br /><br /><i>Women's Work</i> is an unforgettable story of four women as well as an electrifying meditation on the evasions of marriage, motherhood, feminism, and privilege.",3.86,352,Hardcover, ,154,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40847163-women-s-work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40847163-women-s-work

The daughter of immigrants, she was raised in an Oakland, California community that cared deeply about social justice; her parents--an esteemed economist from Jamaica and an admired cancer researcher from India--met as activists in the civil rights movement when they were graduate students at Berkeley. Growing up, Harris herself never hid her passion for justice, and when she became a prosecutor out of law school, a deputy district attorney, she quickly established herself as one of the most innovative change agents in American law enforcement. She progressed rapidly to become the elected District Attorney for San Francisco, and then the chief law enforcement officer of the state of California as a whole. Known for bringing a voice to the voiceless, she took on the big banks during the foreclosure crisis, winning a historic settlement for California's working families. Her hallmarks were applying a holistic, data-driven approach to many of California's thorniest issues, always eschewing stale ""tough on crime"" rhetoric as presenting a series of false choices. Neither ""tough"" nor ""soft"" but <i>smart</i> on crime became her mantra. Being smart means learning the truths that can make us better as a community, and supporting those truths with all our might. That has been the pole star that guided Harris to a transformational career as the top law enforcement official in California, and it is guiding her now as a transformational United States Senator, grappling with an array of complex issues that affect her state, our country, and the world, from health care and the new economy to immigration, national security, the opioid crisis, and accelerating inequality.<br /><br />By reckoning with the big challenges we face together, drawing on the hard-won wisdom and insight from her own career and the work of those who have most inspired her, Kamala Harris offers in <i>The Truths We Hold</i> a master class in problem-solving, in crisis management, and leadership in challenging times. Through the arc of her own life, on into the great work of our day, she communicates a vision of shared struggle, shared purpose, and shared values. In a book rich in many home truths, not least is that a relatively small number of people work very hard to convince a great many of us that we have less in common than we actually do, but it falls to us to look past them and get on with the good work of living our common truth. When we do, our shared effort will continue to sustain us and this great nation, now and in the years to come.",3.99,336,Kindle Edition, ,1377,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40861864-the-truths-we-hold,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40861864-the-truths-we-hold

Premchand, the father, is a doctor who has worked doggedly to grow his practice and give his family security; his wife, Urmila, runs a business importing artisanal Kenyan crafts; and their son, Sunil, after quitting the pre-med track, has gotten accepted to a PhD program in philosophy at Harvard. But the parents have kept a very important secret from Sunil: his cousin, Bimal, is actually his older brother. And when this previously hidden history is revealed by an unforeseen accident, and the entire family is forced to return to Nairobi, Sunil reveals his own well-kept, explosive secret: his Jewish-American girlfriend, who has accompanied him to Kenya, is, in fact, already his wife.

</b><br /><strong>A five-hundred-year-old legend. An ancient curse. A stunning medical mystery. And a pioneering journey into the unknown heart of the world's densest jungle.</strong><br /><br />Since the days of conquistador Hernán Cortés, rumors have circulated about a lost city of immense wealth hidden somewhere in the Honduran interior, called the White City or the Lost City of the Monkey God. Indigenous tribes speak of ancestors who fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyone who enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of the Monkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.<br /><br /><br />Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joined a team of scientists on a groundbreaking new quest. In 2012 he climbed aboard a rickety, single-engine plane carrying the machine that would change everything: lidar, a highly advanced, classified technology that could map the terrain under the densest rainforest canopy. In an unexplored valley ringed by steep mountains, that flight revealed the unmistakable image of a sprawling metropolis, tantalizing evidence of not just an undiscovered city but an enigmatic, lost civilization.<br /><br /><br />Venturing into this raw, treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful wilderness to confirm the discovery, Preston and the team battled torrential rains, quickmud, disease-carrying insects, jaguars, and deadly snakes. But it wasn't until they returned that tragedy struck: Preston and others found they had contracted in the ruins a horrifying, sometimes lethal-and incurable-disease.<br /><br /><br />Suspenseful and shocking, filled with colorful history, hair-raising adventure, and dramatic twists of fortune, THE LOST CITY OF THE MONKEY GOD is the absolutely true, eyewitness account of one of the great discoveries of the twenty-first century.<br />",3.91,326,Kindle Edition, ,1396,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40873920-the-lost-city-of-the-monkey-god,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40873920-the-lost-city-of-the-monkey-god

Rajni, a school principal is a stickler for order. Jezmeen, a thirty-year-old struggling actress, fears her big break may never come. Shirina, the peacemaking ""good"" sister married into wealth and enjoys a picture-perfect life.<br /><br />On her deathbed, their mother voices one last wish: that her daughters will make a pilgrimage together to the Golden Temple in Amritsar to carry out her final rites. After a trip to India with her mother long ago, Rajni vowed never to return. But she’s always been a dutiful daughter, and cannot, even now, refuse her mother’s request. Jezmeen has just been publicly fired from her television job, so the trip to India is a welcome break to help her pick up the pieces of her broken career. Shirina’s in-laws are pushing her to make a pivotal decision about her married life; time away will help her decide whether to meekly obey, or to bravely stand up for herself for the first time.<br /><br />Arriving in India, these sisters will make unexpected discoveries about themselves, their mother, and their lives—and learn the real story behind the trip Rajni took with their Mother long ago—a momentous journey that resulted in Mum never being able to return to India again.<br /><br /><em>The Unlikely Adventures of the Shergill Sisters</em> is a female take on the Indian travel narrative. ""I was curious about how different the trip would be if it were undertaken by women, who are vulnerable to different dangers in a male-dominated society,"" Balli Kaur Jaswal writes. ""I also wanted to explore the tensions between tradition and modernity in immigrant communities, and particularly how those tensions play out among women like these sisters, who are the first generation to be raised outside of India.""<br /><br />Powerful, emotionally evocative, and wonderfully atmospheric, <em>The Unlikely Adventures of the Shergill Sisters</em> is a charming and thoughtful story that illuminates the bonds of family, sisterhood, and heritage that tether us despite our differences.

In our current politics we recognize African-American history--the spot under our country's rug where the terrorism and injustices of white supremacy are habitually swept. <i>Stony the Road</i> lifts the rug."" --Nell Irvin Painter, <i>New York Times Book Review</i> </b><br /><br />A profound new rendering of the struggle by African-Americans for equality after the Civil War and the violent counter-revolution that resubjugated them, as seen through the prism of the war of images and ideas that have left an enduring racist stain on the American mind.<br /><br />The abolition of slavery in the aftermath of the Civil War is a familiar story, as is the civil rights revolution that transformed the nation after World War II. But the century in between remains a mystery: if emancipation sparked ""a new birth of freedom"" in Lincoln's America, why was it necessary to march in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s America? In this new book, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., one of our leading chroniclers of the African-American experience, seeks to answer that question in a history that moves from the Reconstruction Era to the ""nadir"" of the African-American experience under Jim Crow, through to World War I and the Harlem Renaissance.<br /><br />Through his close reading of the visual culture of this tragic era, Gates reveals the many faces of Jim Crow and how, together, they reinforced a stark color line between white and black Americans. Bringing a lifetime of wisdom to bear as a scholar, filmmaker, and public intellectual, Gates uncovers the roots of structural racism in our own time, while showing how African Americans after slavery combatted it by articulating a vision of a ""New Negro"" to force the nation to recognize their humanity and unique contributions to America as it hurtled toward the modern age.<br /><br />The story Gates tells begins with great hope, with the Emancipation Proclamation, Union victory, and the liberation of nearly 4 million enslaved African-Americans. Until 1877, the federal government, goaded by the activism of Frederick Douglass and many others, tried at various turns to sustain their new rights. But the terror unleashed by white paramilitary groups in the former Confederacy, combined with deteriorating economic conditions and a loss of Northern will, restored ""home rule"" to the South. The retreat from Reconstruction was followed by one of the most violent periods in our history, with thousands of black people murdered or lynched and many more afflicted by the degrading impositions of Jim Crow segregation.<br /><br />An essential tour through one of America's fundamental historical tragedies, <i>Stony the Road</i> is also a story of heroic resistance, as figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells fought to create a counter-narrative, and culture, inside the lion's mouth. As sobering as this tale is, it also has within it the inspiration that comes with encountering the hopes our ancestors advanced against the longest odds.",4.15,296,Hardcover, ,310,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40909438-stony-the-road,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40909438-stony-the-road

Her story is raw like that first bite of wild onion, alive with startling imagery, and told with uncommon emotional power.<br /><br />Regan grew up the youngest of four headstrong girls on a small farm in Northwest Indiana. While gathering raspberries as a toddler, Regan preternaturally understood to pick just the ripe fruit and leave the rest for another day. In the family's leaf-strewn fields, the orange flutes of chanterelles beckoned her while they eluded others.<br /><br />Regan has had this intense, almost otherworldly connection with food and the earth it comes from since her childhood, but connecting with people has always been more difficult. She was a little girl who longed to be a boy, gay in an intolerant community, an alcoholic before she turned twenty, and a woman in an industry dominated by men--she often felt she ""wasn't made for this world,"" and as far as she could tell, the world tended to agree. But as she learned to cook in her childhood farmhouse, got her first restaurant job at age fifteen, taught herself cutting-edge cuisine while running a ""new gatherer"" underground supper club, and worked her way from front-of-house staff to running her own kitchen, Regan found that food could help her navigate the strangeness of the world around her.<br /><br />Regan cooks with instinct, memory, and an emotional connection to her ingredients that can't be taught.

But perhaps a Jedi’s most essential duty is to pass on what they have learned. Master Yoda trained Dooku; Dooku trained Qui-Gon Jinn; and now Qui-Gon has a Padawan of his own. But while Qui-Gon has faced all manner of threats and danger as a Jedi, nothing has ever scared him like the thought of failing his apprentice.<br /><br />Obi-Wan Kenobi has deep respect for his Master, but struggles to understand him. Why must Qui-Gon so often disregard the laws that bind the Jedi? Why is Qui-Gon drawn to ancient Jedi prophecies instead of more practical concerns? And why wasn’t Obi-Wan told that Qui-Gon is considering an invitation to join the Jedi Council—knowing it would mean the end of their partnership?

These are the very same behaviors that typify good soldiering and foster a sense of belonging among troops, whether they’re fighting on the front lines or engaged in non-combat activities away from the action. Drawing from history, psychology, and anthropology, bestselling author Sebastian Junger shows us just how at odds the structure of modern society is with our tribal instincts, arguing that the difficulties many veterans face upon returning home from war do not stem entirely from the trauma they’ve suffered, but also from the individualist societies they must reintegrate into.<br /><br />A 2011 study by the Canadian Forces and Statistics Canada reveals that 78 percent of military suicides from 1972 to the end of 2006 involved veterans. Though these numbers present an implicit call to action, the government is only just taking steps now to address the problems veterans face when they return home. But can the government ever truly eliminate the challenges faced by returning veterans? Or is the problem deeper, woven into the very fabric of our modern existence? Perhaps our circumstances are not so bleak, and simply understanding that beneath our modern guises we all belong to one tribe or another would help us face not just the problems of our nation but of our individual lives as well.<br /><br />Well-researched and compellingly written, this timely look at how veterans react to coming home will reconceive our approach to veteran’s affairs and help us to repair our current social dynamic.",4.02,182,Kindle Edition, ,887,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940205-tribe,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940205-tribe

  <div>N. K. Jemisin is one of the most powerful and acclaimed speculative fiction authors of our time. In the first collection of her evocative short fiction, Jemisin equally challenges and delights readers with thought-provoking narratives of destruction, rebirth, and redemption. </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>In these stories, Jemisin sharply examines modern society, infusing magic into the mundane, and drawing deft parallels in the fantasy realms of her imagination. Dragons and hateful spirits haunt the flooded streets of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In a parallel universe, a utopian society watches our world, trying to learn from our mistakes. A black mother in the Jim Crow South must save her daughter from a fey offering impossible promises. And in the Hugo award-nominated short story ""The City Born Great,"" a young street kid fights to give birth to an old metropolis's soul.</div>

  <b>, the book that inspired the iconic film, through the eyes of author L. Frank Baum's intrepid wife, Maud--from the family's hardscrabble days in South Dakota to the Hollywood film set where she first meets Judy Garland.</b>
</b><br /><br />Maud Gage Baum, widow of the author of the book <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, met Judy Garland, the young actress playing the role of Dorothy on the set of <i>The Wizard of Oz </i>in 1939. At the time, Maud was seventy-eight and Judy was sixteen. In spite of their age difference, Maud immediately connected to Judy--especially when Maud heard her sing ""Over the Rainbow,"" a song whose yearning brought to mind the tough years in South Dakota when Maud and her husband struggled to make a living--until Frank Baum's book became a national sensation. <br />     <br />This wonderfully evocative two-stranded story recreates Maud's youth as the rebellious daughter of a leading suffragette, and the prairie years of Maud and Frank's early days when they lived among the people--especially young Dorothy--who would inspire Frank's masterpiece. Woven into this past story is one set in 1939, describing the high-pressured days on <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> film set where Judy is being badgered by the director, producer, and her ambitious stage mother to lose weight, bind her breasts, and laugh, cry, and act terrified on command. As Maud had promised to protect the original Dorothy back in Aberdeen, she now takes on the job of protecting young Judy.",4.14,352,Kindle Edition, ,249,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40964190-finding-dorothy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40964190-finding-dorothy

Misty and her sister were kept as slaves on a mountain ranch and subjected to almost complete isolation, sexual abuse, and extreme physical violence. Their step-father kept a loaded rifle by the door to make sure the young girls were too terrified to try to escape. No rescue would ever come since the few people who knew they existed did not care.<br />When Misty reached her teens, her parents feared she and her sister would escape and took them to an Amish community. Devastated to again find herself in a world of fear, cruelty, and abuse, Misty was sexually assaulted by the bishop. As Misty recalls, ""Amish sexual abusers are only shunned by the church for six weeks, a punishment that never seems to work... I knew I had to get help, and one freezing morning in early March, I made a dash for a tiny police station in rural Minnesota.

Dick no es más que el nombre de un escritor de ciencia ficción, cuyas obras inspiraron las películas de ""Blade Runner"" y ""Desafío Total"". Para otros, es uno de los escritores esenciales del siglo XX. Y, para unos pocos, el agente de una auténtica Revelación.<br /><br />Una cuestión obsesiva que ha hecho de su vida caótica una extraña odisea espiritual: ¿Quién sabe lo que es realmente?, ¿Quién de nosotros puede probar, por ejemplo, que Alemania y Japón no ganaron la guerra, que vivimos en la Tierra, que somos hombres, que no estamos muertos?<br /><br />En California de los años sesenta, esas vertiginosas dudas llevaron a Dick a un encuentro con las drogas. Confió en que le darían acceso, más allá de los simulacros, a una Realidad Última. Se convirtió en un apóstol del LSD, un gurú de la contracultura. El hombre en el castillo, Ubik, La penúltima<br />verdad, unas novelas que se mueven en el estrecho filo entre la revelación y la locura, fueron la Biblia psicodélica para toda una generación.<br /><br />Entonces el sueño se convirtió en pesadilla. El explorador de la conciencia se perdió dentro del laberinto. En 1974, tras los años de vagabundeo espantoso, tuvo una experiencia mística, y hasta el momento de su muerte se preguntó si era un profeta o el juguete de una psicosis paranoica, y si existía una diferencia entre ambos.<br /><br />A quien Dios habla ¿oye algo más que su propia voz?<br /><br />Yo estoy vivo y vosotros estáis muertos.

In this book, Chris Bernhardt offers an introduction to quantum computing that is accessible to anyone who is comfortable with high school mathematics. He explains qubits, entanglement, quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms, and other quantum-related topics as clearly as possible for the general reader. Bernhardt, a mathematician himself, simplifies the mathematics as much as he can and provides elementary examples that illustrate both how the math works and what it means.<br /><br />Bernhardt introduces the basic unit of quantum computing, the qubit, and explains how the qubit can be measured; discusses entanglement--which, he says, is easier to describe mathematically than verbally--and what it means when two qubits are entangled (citing Einstein's characterization of what happens when the measurement of one entangled qubit affects the second as ""spooky action at a distance""); and introduces quantum cryptography. He recaps standard topics in classical computing--bits, gates, and logic--and describes Edward Fredkin's ingenious billiard ball computer. He defines quantum gates, considers the speed of quantum algorithms, and describes the building of quantum computers.

But even she didn't expect to uncover a killer within the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Rooting him out and exposing internal corruption got her a bullet wound and six months of desk duty. Now, she's finally back in the field, called in when an off-duty FBI agent and his cadaver dog fall into a sinkhole filled with human bones.<br /><br />Found deep in Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, the skeletal remains date back almost two decades, the same time a beloved local teen disappeared.

And what about individual potential: what defines a person’s limits?<br /><br />For years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation. <i>Endure</i> widely disseminates these findings for the first time: It’s the brain that dictates how far we can go—which means we can always push ourselves further.<br /><br />Hutchinson presents an overview of science’s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs’ legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits (like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, we go until the tank runs out of gas), he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals—whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid—and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.<br /><br />An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology—brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging—and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today and shows how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance—and get the most out of their bodies.",4.15,321,Kindle Edition, ,450,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41014339-endure,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41014339-endure

During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene?<br /> <br />Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong.<br /> <br />With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers.

Our personal fulfillment depends on how well we choose and execute these commitments. Joy comes when we fuse them into one coherent whole, with each of these commitments fortifying and strengthening the others. In<i> The Committed Life, </i>David Brooks looks at people--from Dostoyevsky to Holocaust survivor Etty Hillesum to African educational entrepreneur Fred Swaniker--who have lived joyous, committed lives, and who have embraced the necessity of dependence. He gathers their wisdom on how to choose a partner, how to pick a vocation, how to live out a philosophy, and how we can begin to integrate our commitments into one overriding purpose.<br /><br />In short, this book is meant to help us all lead more meaningful lives. But it's also a provocative social commentary. We live in a society, Brooks argues, that celebrates freedom and choice, that tells us to be true to ourselves, to march to the beat of our own drummer at the expense of surrendering to a cause, rooting ourselves in a neighborhood, and binding ourselves to others by social solidarity and love. We have taken individualism to the extreme degree--and, in the process, we have torn the social fabric in a thousand different ways. The path to repair is through making deeper commitments.<br /><br /><i>The Social Animal</i> gave us a tale of human nature. <i>The Road to Character</i> traced the history of a great moral tradition--a riveting examination of morality in our time, but with <i>The Committed Life</i>, Brooks turns his mind to what happens when we put commitment-making at the center of life, producing one of Brooks' most personal and revolutionary books yet.",3.74,344,Kindle Edition, ,70,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41023090-the-second-mountain,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41023090-the-second-mountain

By digging into the data, Oster found that much of the conventional pregnancy wisdom was wrong. In CRIBSHEET, she now tackles an even great challenge: decision making in the early years of parenting. <br /><br />As any new parent knows, there is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and the internet. From the earliest days, parents get the message that they must make certain choices around feeding, sleep, and schedule or all will be lost. There's a rule--or three--for everything. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the tradeoffs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision? <br /><br />Armed with the data, Oster finds that the conventional wisdom doesn't always hold up. She debunks myths around breastfeeding (not a panacea), sleep training (not so bad!), potty training (wait until they're ready or possibly bribe with M&amp;Ms), language acquisition (early talkers aren't necessarily geniuses), and many other topics. She also shows parents how to think through freighted questions like if and how to go back to work, how to think about toddler discipline, and how to have a relationship and parent at the same time. <br /><br />Economics is the science of decision-making, and CRIBSHEET is a thinking parent's guide to the chaos and frequent misinformation of the early years.

Once abundant in North America, these majestic creatures were hunted to near extinction in the lower 48 states by the 1920s. But in recent decades, conservationists have brought wolves back to the Rockies, igniting a battle over the very soul of the West.<br /><br />With novelistic detail, Nate Blakeslee tells the gripping story of one of these wolves, O-Six, a charismatic alpha female named for the year of her birth. Uncommonly powerful, with gray fur and faint black ovals around each eye, O-Six is a kind and merciful leader, a fiercely intelligent fighter, and a doting mother. She is beloved by wolf watchers, particularly renowned naturalist Rick McIntyre, and becomes something of a social media star, with followers around the world.<br /><br />But as she raises her pups and protects her pack, O-Six is challenged on all fronts: by hunters, who compete with wolves for the elk they both prize; by cattle ranchers who are losing livestock and have the ear of politicians; and by other Yellowstone wolves who are vying for control of the park’s stunningly beautiful Lamar Valley.<br /><br />These forces collide in <i>American Wolf</i>, a riveting multi-generational saga of hardship and triumph that tells a larger story about the ongoing cultural clash in the West—between those fighting for a vanishing way of life and those committed to restoring one of the country’s most iconic landscapes.",4.38,320,Paperback, ,490,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41078131-american-wolf,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41078131-american-wolf

Our ancestors travelled long distances on foot, gaining new experiences and learning from them. But as universal as walking is, each of us will experience it differently. For Erling Kagge, walking is the gateway to the questions that fascinate him--Why do we walk? Where do we walk from? What is our destination?--and in this book he invites us to investigate them along with him. Language reflects the idea that life is one single walk; the word ""journey"" comes from the distance we travel in the course of a day. Walking for Kagge is a natural accompaniment to science: the occasion for the unspoken dialogue of thinking. Walking is also the antidote to the speed at which we conduct our lives, to our insistence on rushing, on doing everything in a precipitous manner--walking is among the most radical things we can do.",3.78,192,Hardcover, ,80,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41115026-walking,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41115026-walking

  <b>A sweeping historical novel about a dancehall girl and an orphan boy whose fates entangle over an old Chinese superstition about men who turn into tigers.</b>
</p><p>When 11-year-old Ren’s master dies, he makes one last request of his Chinese houseboy: that Ren find his severed finger, lost years ago in an accident, and reunite it with his body. Ren has 49 days, or else his master’s soul will roam the earth, unable to rest in peace. </p><p>Ji Lin always wanted to be a doctor, but as a girl in 1930s Malaysia, apprentice dressmaker is a more suitable occupation. Secretly, though, Ji Lin also moonlights as a dancehall girl to help pay off her beloved mother’s Mahjong debts. One night, Ji Lin’s dance partner leaves her with a gruesome souvenir: a severed finger. Convinced the finger is bad luck, Ji Lin enlists the help of her erstwhile stepbrother to return it to its rightful owner. </p><p>As the 49 days tick down, and a prowling tiger wreaks havoc on the town, Ji Lin and Ren’s lives intertwine in ways they could never have imagined. Propulsive and lushly written, <i>The Night Tiger </i>explores colonialism and independence, ancient superstition and modern ambition, sibling rivalry and first love.

Kirsch, who was one of Langdon’s first students at Harvard two decades earlier, is about to reveal an astonishing breakthrough . . . one that will answer two of the fundamental questions of human existence. As the event begins, Langdon and several hundred guests find themselves captivated by an utterly original presentation, which Langdon realizes will be far more controversial than he ever imagined. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch’s precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Reeling and facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced into a desperate bid to escape Bilbao. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch to stage the provocative event. Together they flee to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch’s secret. Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme religion, Langdon and Vidal must evade a tormented enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain’s Royal Palace itself . . . and who will stop at nothing to silence Edmond Kirsch.

David Hogg called out Adult America. The uprising had begun. Cameron Kasky immediately recruited a colorful band of theatre kids and rising activists and brought them together in his living room to map out a movement. Four days after escaping Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, two dozen extraordinary kids announced the audacious March for Our Lives.

They hit the highway to organize the young activist groups mushrooming across America in their image. Rattled but undeterred, they pressed on in gun country even as adversaries armed with assault weapons tailed them across Texas and Utah trying to scare them off. <br /><br />The Parkland students are genuinely candid about their experiences. We see them cope with shattered friendships and PTSD, along with the normal day-to-day struggles of school, including AP exams and college acceptances. Yet, with the idealism of youth they are mostly bubbling with fresh ideas. As victims refusing victimhood, they continue to devise clever new tactics to stir their generation to action while building a powerhouse network to match the NRA’s. <br /><br />This spell-binding book is a testament to change and a perceptive examination of a pivotal moment in American culture. After two decades of adult hand-wringing, the MFOL kids are mapping a way out. They see a long road ahead, a generational struggle to save every kid of every color from the ravages of gun violence in America.

But his most daring writing took place in the shadows. Thrown into prison for his atheism in 1749, Diderot decided to reserve his best books for posterity--for us, in fact. In the astonishing cache of unpublished writings left behind after his death, Diderot challenged virtually all of his century's accepted truths, from the sanctity of monarchy, to the racial justification of the slave trade, to the norms of human sexuality. One of Diderot's most attentive readers during his lifetime was Catherine the Great, who not only supported him financially, but invited him to St. Petersburg to talk about the possibility of democratizing the Russian empire.<br /><br />In this thematically organized biography, Andrew S. Curran vividly describes Diderot's tormented relationship with Rousseau, his curious correspondence with Voltaire, his passionate affairs, and his often iconoclastic stands on art, theater, morality, politics, and religion.

And in <i>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</i>, a woman cares for an artificial intelligence over twenty years, elevating a faddish digital pet into what might be a true living being. Also included are two brand-new stories: <i>Omphalos</i> and <i>Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom</i>.<br /><br />In this fantastical and elegant collection, Ted Chiang wrestles with the oldest questions on earth—What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human?—and ones that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.",4.28,352,Kindle Edition, ,3808,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41160292-exhalation,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41160292-exhalation

Stella’s childhood is full of strange, life-threatening incidents—moments where ordinary situations like cooking eggplant or feeding the pigs inexplicably take lethal turns. Even Stella’s own mother is convinced that her daughter is cursed or haunted.<br /><br />In her rugged Italian village, Stella is considered an oddity—beautiful and smart, insolent and cold. Stella uses her peculiar toughness to protect her slower, plainer baby sister Tina from life’s harshest realities. But she also provokes the ire of her father Antonio: a man who demands subservience from women and whose greatest gift to his family is his absence.<br /><br />When the Fortunas emigrate to America on the cusp of World War II, Stella and Tina must come of age side-by-side in a hostile new world with strict expectations for each of them. Soon Stella learns that her survival is worthless without the one thing her family will deny her at any cost: her independence.<br /><br />In present-day Connecticut, one family member tells this heartrending story, determined to understand the persisting rift between the now-elderly Stella and Tina.

It would not stop there. Before long, the business had turned into a sprawling multinational conglomerate engaged in almost every conceivable aspect of criminal mayhem. Yachts carrying $100 million in cocaine. Safe houses in Hong Kong filled with gold bars. Shipments of methamphetamine from North Korea. Weapons deals with Iran. Mercenary armies in Somalia. Teams of hitmen in the Philippines. Encryption programs so advanced that the government could not break them.<br /><br />The man behind it all, pulling the strings from a laptop in Manila, was Paul Calder Le Roux—a reclusive programmer turned criminal genius who could only exist in the networked world of the twenty-first century, and the kind of self-made crime boss that American law enforcement had never imagined.<br /><br />For half a decade, DEA agents played a global game of cat-and-mouse with Le Roux as he left terror and chaos in his wake. Each time they came close, he would slip away. It would take relentless investigative work, and a shocking betrayal from within his organization, to catch him. And when he was finally caught, the story turned again, as Le Roux struck a deal to bring down his own organization and the people he had once employed.<br /><br />Award-winning investigative journalist Evan Ratliff spent four years piecing together this intricate puzzle, chasing LeRoux's empire and his shadowy henchmen around the world, conducting hundreds of interviews and uncovering thousands of documents. The result is a riveting, unprecedented account of a crime boss built by and for the digital age.<br /><br /><b>Advance praise for <em>The Mastermind</em></b><br /><br />“As directors, we spend countless hours imagining heightened plots and memorable characters that will leave a lasting impression on audiences. The true tale of obsession, genius, intrigue, and vengeance detailed in <em>The Mastermind</em> is as gripping and cinematic as anything we could endeavor to conjure up.”—<b>Joe and Anthony Russo, directors of <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War,</em> and <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></b><br /><br />“With his relentless and fearless reporting, Evan Ratliff has pried open a hidden world filled with high-tech gangsters and drug kingpins and double-crossers and stone-cold hitmen. The story is as fascinating as it is terrifying, and it is one that will hold you in its grip.”—<b>David Grann, author of <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em></b><br /><br />“If truth is stranger than fiction, then <em>The Mastermind</em> is the truest book you’ll read this year. The only thing predictable about it is how quickly you’ll turn the pages.”—<b>Noah Hawley, author of <em>Before the Fall</em> and creator of the TV series <em>Fargo</em></b><br /> <br />“This is a mesmerizing, absolutely bonkers story about a man as brilliant as he is villainous. You’ll find yourself sucked in, freaked out, and ultimately blown away by Ratliff's storytelling and tireless reporting. <em>The Mastermind</em> is a masterpiece.”—<b>Nick Thompson, editor-in-chief, <em>Wired</em></b>",4.04,480,Hardcover, ,340,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41181600-the-mastermind,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41181600-the-mastermind

In addition to this looming dynastic crisis, decades of enormous military commitments had left Spain a virtually bankrupt state with vulnerable frontiers and a depleted army. In Silvia Z. Mitchell's revisionist account, <em>Queen, Mother, and Stateswoman</em>, Queen Regent Mariana of Austria emerges as a towering figure at court and on the international stage, while her key collaborators--the secretaries, ministers, and diplomats who have previously been ignored or undervalued--take their rightful place in history.<br /><br />Mitchell provides a nuanced account of Mariana of Austria's ten-year regency (1665-75) of the global Spanish Empire and examines her subsequent role as queen mother. Drawing from previously unmined primary sources, including Council of State deliberations, diplomatic correspondence, Mariana's and Carlos's letters, royal household papers, manuscripts, and legal documents, Mitchell describes how, over the course of her regency, Mariana led the monarchy out of danger and helped redefine the military and diplomatic blocs of Europe in Spain's favor. She follows Mariana's exile from court and recounts how the dowager queen used her extensive connections and diplomatic experience to move the negotiations for her son's marriage forward, effectively exploiting the process to regain her position.<br /><br />A new narrative of the Spanish Habsburg monarchy in the later seventeenth century, this volume advances our knowledge of women's legitimate political entitlement in the early modern period. It will be welcomed by scholars and students of queenship, women's studies, and early modern Spain.",4.33,312,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41385505-queen-mother-and-stateswoman,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41385505-queen-mother-and-stateswoman

Targeting American utility companies, NATO, and electric grids in Eastern Europe, the strikes became ever more brazen, eventually leading to the first-ever blackouts triggered by hackers. They culminated in the summer of 2017 when malware known as NotPetya was unleashed, compromising, disrupting, and paralyzing some of the world's largest companies. At the attack's epicenter in Ukraine, ATMs froze. The railway and postal systems shut down. NotPetya spread around the world, inflicting an unprecedented ten billions of dollars in damage--the largest, most penetrating cyberattack the world had ever seen.<br /><br />The hackers behind these attacks are quickly gaining a reputation as the most dangerous team of cyberwarriors in the internet's history: Sandworm. Believed to be working in the service of Russia's military intelligence agency, they represent a persistent, highly skilled, state-sponsored hacking force, one whose talents are matched by their willingness to launch broad, unrestrained attacks on the most critical infrastructure of their adversaries. They target government and private sector, military and civilians alike.<br /><br />From WIRED senior writer Andy Greenberg comes Sandworm, the true story of the desperate hunt to identify and track those attackers.

It also enjoins the English to “lose, and start again at your beginnings/ And never breathe a word about your loss.” Most modern English heroics are screw-ups, retreats or disasters: the charge of the Light Brigade, the doomed Franklin expedition to find the Northwest Passage, “Scott of the Antarctic”, the “last stand” against the Zulus at Isandlwana, Gordon of Khartoum, the Somme, the flight from Dunkirk. The parallels with Brexit are obvious, but the problem is that the cult of heroic failure was developed precisely in an empire that could afford to play up its failures because it was so successful. Its pathos becomes bathos in a post-imperial world.

With the recent passing of her Chinese immigrant parents, she's had her fill of uncertainty. She's content just to carry on: She goes to work, troubleshoots the teen-targeted Gemstone Bible, watches movies in a Greenpoint basement with her boyfriend.<br /><br />So Candace barely notices when a plague of biblical proportions sweeps New York. Then Shen Fever spreads. Families flee. Companies cease operations. The subways screech to a halt. Her bosses enlist her as part of a dwindling skeleton crew with a big end-date payoff. Soon entirely alone, still unfevered, she photographs the eerie, abandoned city as the anonymous blogger NY Ghost.<br /><br />Candace won't be able to make it on her own forever, though. Enter a group of survivors, led by the power-hungry IT tech Bob. They're traveling to a place called the Facility, where, Bob promises, they will have everything they need to start society anew. But Candace is carrying a secret she knows Bob will exploit.

They wrote ballads, ran coffee houses, lived on country estates, they breathed ink-dust from printing presses and escaped people-traffickers.

Now, in this devastating narrative of five lives, Rubenhold finally sets the record straight, revealing a world not just of Dickens and Queen Victoria, but of poverty, homelessness and rampant misogyny.

Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life.<br /><br />But the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined.

Und tatsächlich, so geschieht es. Er kann sich nun den hedonistischen Ausschweifungen seines von Endzeitstimmung und Dekadenz geprägten Zeitalters (<i>›Fin de siècle‹</i>; Ende 19. Jhdts.) hingeben, ohne seinen Körper zu beeinträchtigen. Doch wenn er das Bild betrachtet, erkennt er, wie sich darin Spuren von Hochmut und Verschlagenheit einschreiben.

In seiner Zeit als Erfolgsschriftsteller – seit 1879 in London – wurde Wilde bewundert, aber auch wegen seines Lebenswandels angefeindet: Er war extrovertiert und provokant, war verheiratet, hatte aber auch Liebesbeziehungen zu jüngeren Männern. Auf eine Anklage wegen ›Unzucht‹ folgte 1895 die Verurteilung zu zwei Jahren Zuchthaus mit Zwangsarbeit, was ihn körperlich brach und sozial ins Abseits stellte. Als er wieder frei kam, ging Wilde unter anderem Namen nach Europa, wo er im November 1900 mittellos im Pariser ›Hotel d’ Alsace‹ starb. <i>© Redaktion eClassica, 2018</i>",4.08,217,Kindle Edition, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41594520-oscar-wilde,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41594520-oscar-wilde

For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor walk-up apartment with some surprisingly verbal vegetation. And then there's the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it's very popular in Druhástrana, the far-away (or, according to many sources, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee's early youth. The world's truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread, however, is Harriet's charismatic childhood friend Gretel Kercheval —a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met. <br /><br />Decades later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother's long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet's story. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value. Endlessly surprising and satisfying, written with Helen Oyeyemi's inimitable style and imagination, it is a true feast for the reader.",3.06,272,Kindle Edition, ,107,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41594784-gingerbread,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41594784-gingerbread

Porque la democracia ya no termina con un <i>bang</i> (un golpe militar o una revolución), sino con un leve quejido: el lento y progresivo debilitamiento de las instituciones esenciales, como son el sistema jurídico o la prensa, y la erosión global de las normas políticas tradicionales. La buena noticia es que hay opciones de salida en el camino hacia el autoritarismo y los populismos de diversa índole.<br /><br /> Basándose en años de investigación, los autores revelan un profundo conocimiento de cómo y por qué mueren las instituciones democráticas.

  <i>A modern master of suspense, critically acclaimed author Charlie Donlea returns with a taut, gripping novel about the deadly secrets hiding in plain sight . . .</i>
</b><br />  <br /> The truth is easy to miss, even when it’s right in front of us. As a forensic reconstructionist, Rory Moore sheds light on cold-case homicides by piecing together crime scene details others fail to see. Cleaning out her late father’s law office a week after his burial, she receives a call that plunges her into a decades-old case come to life once more. <br /><br /> In the summer of 1979, five Chicago women went missing. The predator, nicknamed The Thief, left no bodies and no clues behind—until police received a package from a mysterious woman named Angela Mitchell, whose unorthodox investigation skills appear to have led to his identity. But before police could question her, Angela disappeared. Forty years later, The Thief is about to be paroled for Angela’s murder—the only crime the DA could pin on him. As a former client of her father’s, Rory becomes reluctantly involved with the killer—though he continues to insist he didn’t murder Angela. Now he wants Rory to do what her father once promised: prove that Angela is, in fact, still alive.<br /><br /> As Rory begins reconstructing Angela’s last days, another killer emerges from the shadows, replicating those long-ago murders. With every startling discovery she makes, Rory becomes more deeply entangled in the enigma of Angela Mitchell—and in The Thief’s tormented mind. Drawing connections between past and present is the only way to stop the nightmare, but even Rory can’t be prepared for the full, terrifying truth that is emerging . . .",4.20,304,Kindle Edition, ,448,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41735371-some-choose-darkness,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41735371-some-choose-darkness

Marie-Madeleine's codename was Hedgehog.<br /><br />No other French spy network lasted as long or supplied as much crucial intelligence as Alliance--and as a result, the Gestapo pursued them relentlessly, capturing, torturing, and executing hundreds of its three thousand agents, including her own lover and many of her key spies. Fourcade had to move her headquarters every week, constantly changing her hair color, clothing, and identity, yet was still imprisoned twice by the Nazis. Both times she managed to escape, once by stripping naked and forcing her thin body through the bars of her cell. The mother of two young children, Marie-Madeleine hardly saw them during the war, so entirely engaged was she in her spy network, preferring they live far from her and out of harm's way. <br /><br />In <i>Madame Fourcade's Secret War</i>, Lynne Olson tells the tense, fascinating story of Fourcade and Alliance against the background of the developing war that split France in two and forced its citizens to live side by side with their hated German occupiers.",4.22,464,Kindle Edition, ,605,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41739312-madame-fourcade-s-secret-war,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41739312-madame-fourcade-s-secret-war

Brown makes mythical pastorals to question the terrors to which we’ve become accustomed, and to celebrate how we survive.

Brought up in a well-to-do upper-middle-class family, who had sent her to Cambridge and the Sorbonne and hoped that she would go into law, the young woman defied their wishes and set her sights on being an artist. Her introduction to Picasso led to a friendship, a love affair, and a relationship of ten years, during which Gilot gave birth to Picasso's two children, Paloma and Claude. Gilot was one of Picasso's muses; she was also very much her own woman, determined to make herself into the remarkable painter she did indeed become. <br /><br /><i>Life with Picasso</i>, written with Carlton Lake and published in 1961, is about Picasso the artist and Picasso the man. We hear him talking about painting and sculpture, his life, his career, as well as other artists, both contemporaries and old masters. We glimpse Picasso in his many and volatile moods, dismissing his work, exultant over his work, entertaining his various superstitions, being an anxious father. We also get a larger picture of literary and artistic Paris, including sketches of Matisse, Stein, Éluard, Gide, Cocteau, Miró, and Chaplin, along with an inside view of the workings of Picasso's house and studio, meeting his right-hand man, Sabartés, his chauffeur, Marcel, and his housekeeper, Inès. We witness Picasso tangling with dealers and, under the German occupation, the Nazi official who, after Hitler's denunciation, were given the task of suppressing Picasso's work--and somehow always came up short. <br /><br /><i>Life with Picasso</i> is not only a portrait of a great artist at the height of his fame; it is also a picture of a talented young woman of exacting intelligence at the outset of her own notable career.",4.07, ,Kindle Edition, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41749637-life-with-picasso,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41749637-life-with-picasso

It's not what you think. <br /><b>
  <br />
</b>Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.<br /><br />David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.<br /><br />Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, <i>Range</i> makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.",4.16,352,Hardcover, ,2263,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range

What is it like to be reviled by some, held up as a beacon of hope by others, and to be an object of fascination to all?<br /><br />In this book, Stormy Daniels tells her whole story for the first time: about how she came to be a leading actress and director in the adult film business, the full truth about her journey from a rough childhood in Louisiana onto the national stage, and everything about the events that led to the nondisclosure agreement and the behind-the-scenes attempts to intimidate her.<br /><br />Stormy is funny, sharp, warm, and impassioned by turns. Her story is a thoroughly American one, of a girl who loved reading and horses and who understood from a very young age what she wanted―and who also knew she'd have to get every step of the way there on her own.<br /><br />People can't stop talking about Stormy Daniels.

</b><br /><b>Chosen as one of Barack Obama's favourite books of 2019<br /></b><br />'<b>A triumph on every level</b>. One of the losses to literature is that Harper Lee never found a way to tell a gothic true-crime story she'd spent years researching. <b>Casey Cep has excavated this mesmerizing story and tells it with grace and insight and a fierce fidelity to the truth.</b>'<br />DAVID GRANN, author of <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i><br /><b>_____________________________</b><br /><b>The stunning story of an Alabama serial killer and the true-crime book that Harper Lee worked on obsessively in the years after <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i><br /></b><br />Reverend Willie Maxwell was a rural preacher accused of murdering five of his family members for insurance money in the 1970s. With the help of a savvy lawyer, he escaped justice for years until a relative shot him dead at the funeral of his last victim. Despite hundreds of witnesses, Maxwell's murderer was acquitted - thanks to the same attorney who had previously defended the Reverend.<br /><br />As Alabama is consumed by these gripping events, it's not long until news of the case reaches Alabama's - and America's - most famous writer. Intrigued by the story, Harper Lee makes a journey back to her home state to witness the Reverend's killer face trial. Lee had the idea of writing her own <i>In Cold Blood,</i> the true-crime classic she had helped her friend Truman Capote research. She spent a year in town reporting on the Maxwell case and many more years trying to finish the book she called <i>The Reverend</i>.<br /><br />Now Casey Cep brings this story to life, from the shocking murders to the courtroom drama to the racial politics of the Deep South. At the same time, she offers a deeply moving portrait of one of America's most beloved writers and her struggle with fame, success and the mystery of artistic creativity.<br /><b><br />This is the story Harper Lee wanted to write. This is the story of why she couldn't.</b><br /><b>_____________________________</b><br />'<b>Fascinating </b>... Cep has spliced together a Southern-gothic tale of multiple murder and the unhappy story of Lee's literary career, to produce a tale that is <b>engrossing in its detail and deeply poignant</b>... [Cep] spends the first third of <i>Furious Hours</i> following the <b>jaw-dropping </b>trail of murders ... <b>Engrossing </b>... <b>Cep writes about all this with great skill, sensitivity and attention to detail</b>.'<br /><i>SUNDAY TIMES</i><br /><br />'<b>It's been a long time since I picked up a book so impossible to put down</b>. <b><i>Furious Hours </i>made me forget dinner, ignore incoming calls, and stay up reading into the small hours. It's a work of literary and legal detection as gripping as a thriller</b>.

In the haute-bohemian circles of Austria, Germany, and Paris, Hitler is circulating a most-wanted list of “cultural degenerates”—artists, writers, and thinkers whose work is deemed antithetical to the new regime.  To prevent the destruction of her favorite art (and artists), the impetuous American heiress and modern art collector, Leonora Calaway, begins chartering boats and planes for an elite group of surrealists to Costalegre, a mysterious resort in the Mexican jungle, where she has a home. <br /><br /><br />The story of what happens to these artists when they reach their destination is told from the point of view of Lara, Leonora’s neglected 15-year-old daughter, who has been pulled out of school to follow her mother to Mexico. Forced from a young age to cohabit with her mother’s eccentric whims, tortured lovers, and entourage of gold-diggers, Lara suffers from emotional, educational, and geographical instability that a Mexican sojourn with surrealists isn’t going to help. But when she meets the outcast Dadaist sculptor Jack Klinger, a much older man who has already been living in Costalegre for some time, Lara thinks she might have found the love and understanding she so badly craves. <br /><br /><br />Sinuous and striking, heartbreaking and strange, <em>Costalegre</em> is heavily inspired by the real-life relationship between the heiress Peggy Guggenheim and her daughter, Pegeen. Acclaimed author Courtney Maum triumphs with this wildly imaginative and curiously touching story of a privileged teenager who has everything a girl could wish for—except for a mother who loves her back. ",3.39,240,Hardcover, ,178,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41827075-costalegre,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41827075-costalegre

Esta seleção, elaborada pelo historiador Marco Antonio Villa, oferece justamente isso: uma viagem pelas palavras e pensamentos que mudaram o Brasil e o mundo. De Péricles na Atenas antes de Cristo a Santo Agostinho; de Símon Bolivar a Thomas Mann, sem deixar de lado os vilões e heróis da modernidade como Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, De Gaulle, Churchill, Roosevelt, Gorbachev e Lenin. <br />Considerado um dos maiores conhecedores da história política do Brasil, Villa apresenta falas que não deveriam ser esquecidas como a de Silva Jardim, uma verdadeira propaganda pró-República, e a de Sílvio Romero, que, anos depois, não economiza críticas ao novo regime. Das conhecidas palavras de Getúlio Vargas à retórica de Ulysses Guimarães ao promulgar a Constituição. <br />E até o discurso de portugueses que tiveram importância na nossa história como o padre Antônio Vieira e o poeta Antero de Quintal. O grande diferencial deste livro para outros do gênero vem deste resgate de falas que foram – e ainda são – importantes na formação do Brasil e da capacidade do autor em escolher os trechos mais significativos de cada discurso. Através desta <br />seleção, o leitor vai compreender o que cada um quis dizer - e o que isso representava naquele contexto. <br />Por fim, fica a mensagem realista, porém esperançosa, do próprio autor: ""Cada discurso pode permitir uma reflexão sobre o Brasil. Vivemos tempos sombrios – outros países, retratados neste livro, também passaram por momentos difíceis. O desafio é encontrar caminhos que superem uma conjuntura crítica. Há um processo constante de mudança. E – ainda bem – sem um ponto final definido"".",3.54,416,Kindle Edition, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41839867-a-hist-ria-em-discursos,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41839867-a-hist-ria-em-discursos

Homesick for her big, noisy Italian family, she summoned them in this novel, which is a celebration of the routines and rituals, in-jokes and insults and, above all, the repeated sayings that make up every family.<br /><br />The father, Giuseppe Levi, is a Jewish scientist, consumed by his work and a mania for hiking. Impatient and intractable, he is constantly at odds with his impressionable and wistful wife Lidia - yet he cannot be without her. Together they preside over their five children in a house filled with argument and activity, books and politics, visitors, friends and famous faces. But as their children grow up against the backdrop of Mussolini's Italy, the Levi household must become not only a home - but a stronghold against fascism.<br /><br />Intimate, enchanting and comedic, Family Lexicon is an unforgettable novel about memory, language, and the lasting power that family holds over all of us.<br /><br /><b>'It is perhaps best to say straight off that the book is a masterpiece.' <i>New Yorker</i></b><br /><br /><b>'A small, entrancing classic.'

The seminal rap group brought jazz into the genre, resurrecting timeless rhythms to create masterpieces such as <i>The Low End Theory</i> and <i>Midnight Marauders</i>. Seventeen years after their last album, they resurrected themselves with an intense, socially conscious record, <i>We Got It from Here . . . Thank You 4 Your Service</i>, which arrived when fans needed it most, in the aftermath of the 2016 election. Poet and essayist Hanif Abdurraqib digs into the group's history and draws from his own experience to reflect on how its distinctive sound resonated among fans like himself. The result is as ambitious and genre-bending as the rap group itself.<br /><br />Abdurraqib traces the Tribe's creative career, from their early days as part of the Afrocentric rap collective known as the Native Tongues, through their first three classic albums, to their eventual breakup and long hiatus. Their work is placed in the context of the broader rap landscape of the 1990s, one upended by sampling laws that forced a reinvention in production methods, the East Coast-West Coast rivalry that threatened to destroy the genre, and some record labels' shift from focusing on groups to individual MCs. Throughout the narrative Abdurraqib connects the music and cultural history to their street-level impact. Whether he's remembering <i>The Source</i> magazine cover announcing the Tribe's 1998 breakup or writing personal letters to the group after bandmate Phife Dawg's death, Abdurraqib seeks the deeper truths of A Tribe Called Quest; truths that--like the low end, the bass--are not simply heard in the head, but felt in the chest.",4.48,207,Paperback, ,406,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41864516-go-ahead-in-the-rain,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41864516-go-ahead-in-the-rain

McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: ""Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.""<br /><br />In <i>The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump</i>, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI's agents, and of the institution's integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution.<br /><br />McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI's New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime—which is inextricably linked to the Russian state—and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation's activities, and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.<br /><br /><i>The Threat</i> recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump's November 2016 election and McCabe's firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI's mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen.<br /><br />Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, <i>The Threat</i> tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America.",4.18,288,Kindle Edition, ,764,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41939872-the-threat,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41939872-the-threat

First came hot flashes. Then insomnia. Then depression. As she struggled to express what was happening to her, she came up against a culture of silence. Throughout history, the natural physical transition of menopause has been viewed as something to deny, fear, and eradicate. Menstruation signals fertility and life, and childbirth is revered as the ultimate expression of womanhood. Menopause is seen as a harbinger of death. Some books Steinke found promoted hormone replacement therapy. Others encouraged acceptance. But Steinke longed to understand menopause in a more complex, spiritual, and intellectually engaged way.<br /><br />In <i>Flash Count Diary, </i>Steinke writes frankly about aspects of Menopause that have rarely been written about before. She explores the changing gender landscape that comes with reduced hormone levels, and lays bare the transformation of female desire and the realities of prejudice against older women. Weaving together her personal story with philosophy, science, art, and literature, Steinke reveals that in the seventeenth century, women who had hot flashes in front of others could be accused of being witches; that the model for Duchamp's famous <i>�tant donn�s</i> was a post-reproductive woman; and that killer whales--one of the only other species on earth to undergo menopause--live long post-reproductive lives.<br /><br /><i>Flash Count Diary, </i>with its deep research, open play of ideas, and reverence for the female body, will change the way you think about menopause. It's a deeply feminist book--honest about the intimations of mortality that menopause brings while also arguing for the ascendancy, beauty, and power of the post-reproductive years.",3.66,240,Hardcover, ,146,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41940273-flash-count-diary,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41940273-flash-count-diary

Equally interested in the sensual and the serious, the erotic and the academic, this collection experiments with form, dialect, persona, and voice. Ultimately a hybrid document, <em>Lucy Negro Redux</em> harnesses blues poetry, deconstructed sonnets, historical documents and lyric essays to tell the challenging, many-faceted story of the Dark Lady, her Shakespeare, and their real and imagined milieu. Inspired by the book, The Nashville Ballet will premiere “Lucy Negro Redux,” an original ballet conceived and choreographed by Artistic Director &amp; CEO, Paul Vasterling, in February 2019 at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. A collaboration of music, poetry and choreography, this contemporary ballet based on Caroline Randall Williams’ book of poetry of the same name is unique in process, content and format. The project uses dance and music to execute the author’s exploration of more than 160 of Shakespeare’s sonnets, and her arrival to a thesis that the “Dark Lady” and the “Fair Youth”―the subjects and inspiration of these sonnets―were undoubtedly a black woman and a young man lover. Ultimately, in experiencing Lucy through themes of love, otherness and equality, the narrator, and thus the audience, finds a powerful female voice.",4.50,95,Paperback, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41959816-lucy-negro-redux,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41959816-lucy-negro-redux

Newly sober she realizes her marriage is coming apart. Addictions had just been masking a deeper issue–denial of her sexuality. Coming to terms with her attraction to women, she meets Suzie, a vibrant and fully out lesbian at an AA meeting. Within months, Miller’s husband moves out and Suzie moves in with Miller and her two sons. But where she expects to finally gain some contentment and live in peace, she discovers only more upheaval. Suzie has an unhappy past of her own and her dark moods will affect the family in devastating ways. <br /> <br />Over the course of four years, with Suzie as her live-in lover and guide, Miller will begin her writing career, gain a sense of self-acceptance, and find a community and culture as a lesbian. But her love for Suzie comes at a deep personal cost. <br /> <br />In this memoir, Miller explores the family dynamics and childhood experiences that led her to become mired in abusive relationships as an adult. She examines her life with Suzie where she is a woman on the verge, beginning to find her voice and come to terms with who she really is. She recognizes that her relationship with Suzie is poisoning her and children’s lives, yet she agonizes over ending it. Who is she without Suzie? As Miller struggles to assert herself, Suzie pushes back. Finally, Miller will endure a terrifying violation that will allow her to break free of Suzie’s addictive hold. <br /> <br />This is a groundbreaking work that unflinchingly addresses the rarely acknowledged subject of abuse in lesbian relationships. <br /> <br />“I thought that being with a woman would be difficult considering other people’s ideas about homosexuality, but I also thought that living with and loving a woman would be utopia. That was my biggest disappointment.” ~ Martha",3.20,281,Kindle Edition, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41967542-four-years-a-memoir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41967542-four-years-a-memoir
