The longtime cemetery for San Francisco, it is the resting place of the likes of Joe DiMaggio, Wyatt Earp, and aviation pioneer Lincoln Beachey.

Keeping a life-altering, soul-enlightening journal, however, is not. At its best, journaling can be among the most transformative of experiences, but you can only get there by learning how to express yourself fully and openly. Enter Samara O'Shea. <br /><br />O'Shea charmed readers with her elegant and witty <i>For the Love of Letters</i>. Now, in <i>Note to Self</i>, she's back to guide us through the fun, effective, and revelatory process of journaling. Along the way, selections from O'Shea's own journals demonstrate what a journal should be: a tool to access inner strengths, uncover unknown passions, face uncertain realities, and get to the center of self. To help create an effective journal, O'Shea provides multiple suggestions and exercises, including: <br /><br /><br />Write in a stream of consciousness: Forget everything you ever learned about writing and just write. Let it all out: the good, bad, mad, angry, boring, and ugly. <br /><br /><br />Ask yourself questions: What do I want to change about myself? What would I never change about myself? <br /><br /><br />Copy quotes: Other people's words can help you figure out where you are in life, or where you'd like to be. <br /><br /><br />It takes time: Don't lose faith if you don't immediately feel better after writing in your journal. Think of each entry as part of a collection that will eventually reveal its meaning to you. <br /><br />O'Shea's own journal entries reveal alternately moving, edgy, and hilarious stories from throughout her life, as she hits the party scene in New York, poses naked as an aspiring model, stands by as her boyfriend discovers an infidelity by (you guessed it) reading her journal, and more. There are also fascinating journal entries of notorious diarists, such as John Wilkes Booth, Anais Nin, and Sylvia Plath. <br /><br />p\A tribute to the healing and reflective power of the written word, <i>Note to Self</i> demonstrates that sometimes being completely honest with yourself is the most dangerous and rewarding pursuit of all.",3.22,192,Hardcover, ,73,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2442377.Note_to_Self,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2442377.Note_to_Self

Boone Pickens is a legendary figure in the business world. Known as the “Oracle of Oil” because of his uncanny ability to predict the direction of fuel prices, he built Mesa Petroleum, one of the largest independent oil companies in the United States, from a $2,500 investment. In the 1980s, Pickens became a household name when he executed a series of unsolicited buyout bids for undervalued oil companies, in the process reinventing the notion of shareholders’ rights. Even his failures were successful in that they forced risk-averse managers to reconsider the way they did business.<br /><br />When Pickens left Mesa at age sixty-eight after a spectacular downward spiral in the company’s profits, many counted him out. Indeed, what followed for him was a painful divorce, clinical depression, a temporary inability to predict the movement of energy prices, and the loss of 90 percent of his investing capital. But Pickens was far from out.<br /><br />From that personal and professional nadir, Pickens staged one of the most impressive comebacks in the industry, turning his investment fund’s remaining $3 million into $8 billion in profit in just a few years. That made him, at age seventy-seven, the world’s second-highest-paid hedge fund manager. But he wasn’t done yet. Today, Pickens is making some of the world’s most colossal energy bets. If he has his way, most of America’s cars will eventually run on natural gas, and vast swaths of the nation’s prairie land will become places where wind can be harnessed for power generation. Currently no less bold than he was decades ago when he single-handedly transformed America’s oil industry, Pickens is staking billions on the conviction that he knows what’s coming. In this book, he spells out that future in detail, not only presenting a comprehensive plan for American energy independence but also providing a fascinating glimpse into key resources such as water—yet another area where he is putting billions on the line.<br /><br />From a businessman who is extraordinarily humble yet is considered one of the world’s most visionary, <i>The First Billion Is the Hardest</i> is both a riveting account of a life spent pulling off improbable triumphs and a report back from the front of the global energy and natural-resource wars—of vital interest to anyone who has a stake in America’s future.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.76,288,Hardcover, ,71,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2445586.The_First_Billion_Is_the_Hardest,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2445586.The_First_Billion_Is_the_Hardest

Without losing the horror, it presents vampirism as a disease whose secrets can be unlocked by scientific tools. The hero Robert Neville, perhaps the last uninfected man on Earth, finds himself in a paranoid nightmare. By night, the bloodthirsty undead of small-town America besiege his barricaded house: their repeated cry ""Come out, Neville!"" is a famous SF catchphrase. By day, when they hide in shadow and become comatose, Neville gets out his wooden stakes for an orgy of slaughter. He also discovers pseudoscientific explanations, some rather strained, for vampires' fear of light, vulnerability to stakes though not bullets, loathing of garlic, and so on. What gives the story its uneasy power is the gradual perspective shift which shows that by fighting monsters Neville is himself becoming monstrous--not a vampire but something to terrify vampires and haunt their dreams as a dreadful legend from the bad old days. <i>I Am Legend</i> was altered out of recognition when filmed as <i>The Omega Man</i> (1971), starring Charlton Heston.

His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries - and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.<br /><i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant--and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.",3.89, ,Paperback, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2457130._,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2457130._

These bonobos, like others of their species, are capable of reason and carrying on deep relationships - but unlike most bonobos, they also know American Sign Language.<br /><br />Isabel Duncan, a scientist at the Great Ape Language Lab, doesn’t understand people, but animals she gets - especially the bonobos. Isabel feels more comfortable in their world than she’s ever felt among humans... until she meets John Thigpen, a very married reporter who braves the ever-present animal rights protesters outside the lab to see what’s really going on inside.<br /><br />When an explosion rocks the lab, severely injuring Isabel and “liberating” the apes, John’s human interest piece turns into the story of a lifetime, one he’ll risk his career and his marriage to follow.

His reign was one of the most dramatic and important of the entire Middle Ages, leading to war and conquest on an unprecedented scale, and leaving a legacy of division between the peoples of Britain that has lasted from his day to our own.<br /><br />Edward I is familiar to millions as ‘Longshanks’, conqueror of Scotland and nemesis of Sir William Wallace (‘Braveheart’). Yet this story forms only the final chapter of the king’s astonishingly action-packed life. Earlier Edward had defeated and killed the famous Simon de Montfort in battle; travelled across Europe to the Holy Land on crusade; conquered Wales, extinguishing forever its native rulers, and constructing – at Conwy, Harlech, Beaumaris and Caernarfon – the most magnificent chain of castles ever created. He raised the greatest armies of the English Middle Ages, and summoned the largest parliaments; notoriously, he expelled all the Jews from his kingdom. The longest-lived of all England’s medieval kings, he fathered no fewer than fifteen children with his first wife, Eleanor of Castile, and after her death he erected the Eleanor Crosses – the grandest funeral monuments ever fashioned for an English monarch.<br /><br />In this book, Marc Morris examines afresh the forces that drove Edward throughout his relentless career: his character, his Christian faith, and his sense of England’s destiny – a sense shaped in particular by the tales of the legendary King Arthur. He also explores the competing reasons that led Edward’s opponents (including Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and Robert Bruce) to resist him, and the very different societies that then existed in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The result is a sweeping story, immaculately researched yet compellingly told, and a vivid picture of medieval Britain at the moment when its future was decided.",4.12,400,Hardcover, ,189,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2465562.A_Great_and_Terrible_King,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2465562.A_Great_and_Terrible_King

She was a natural at the sport, and her early success propelled her family to sacrifice everything to help her become, by age eleven, one of America’s elite,competing at prestigious events worldwide alongside such future gymnastics’ luminaries as Mary Lou Retton.<br /><br />But as she set her sights higher and higher—the senior national team, the World Championships, the 1988 Olympics—Sey began to change, putting her needs, her health, and her well-being aside in the name of winning. And the adults in her life refused to notice her downward spiral.<br /><br />In <em>Chalked Up</em> Sey reveals the tarnish behind her gold medals. A powerful portrait of intensity and drive, eating disorders and stage parents, abusive coaches and manipulative businessmen, denial and the seduction of success, it is the story of a young girl whose dreams would become eclipsed by the adults around her.

A city glistening with decadence and rife with corruption--a humid, bustling society at the cultural crossroads of British civil servants, American gun runners, Russian princesses, and Chinese gangsters. <br /><br />For Richard Field, a young Englishman new to the international police force, Shanghai represents a brave new world away from the past he is trying to escape. But his naiveté is quickly dashed when he is called to the scene of a brutal crime, in which a young Russian woman, Lena Orlov, has been found sadistically murdered in her bed. Field's idealistic instincts push him to investigate the case, but his attempts are met with apathy--then menace--from his colleagues. He begins to recognize that some cases in Shanghai are intended to remain unsolved, and, in a matter of days, he glimpses the murky depths that lurk beneath a luminous city.<br /><br />Field's drive to find the murderer leads him to Lena's neighbor, Natasha Medvedev.

Bringing new life and energy to this classic work, adapter and illustrator Kristina Gehrmann takes Sinclair's prose and transforms it through pen and ink, allowing the reader to discover (or rediscover) this book and see it from a whole new perspective.",3.75, , , ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2474370.The_Jungle,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2474370.The_Jungle

Written by naval historian Craig L. Symonds, Lincoln and His Admirals unveils an aspect of Lincoln's presidency unexamined by historians until now, revealing how he managed the men who ran the naval side of the Civil War, and how the activities of the Union Navy ultimately affected the course of history. <br /> Beginning with a gripping account of the attempt to re-supply Fort Sumter--a comedy of errors that shows all too clearly the fledgling president's inexperience--Symonds traces Lincoln's steady growth as a wartime commander-in-chief. Absent a Secretary of Defense, he would eventually become de facto commander of joint operations along the coast and on the rivers. That involved dealing with the men who ran the Navy: the loyal but often cranky Navy Secretary Gideon Welles, the quiet and reliable David G. Farragut, the flamboyant and unpredictable Charles Wilkes, the ambitious ordnance expert John Dahlgren, the well-connected Samuel Phillips Lee, and the self-promoting and gregarious David Dixon Porter. Lincoln was remarkably patient; he often postponed critical decisions until the momentum of events made the consequences of those decisions evident. But Symonds also shows that Lincoln could act decisively. Disappointed by the lethargy of his senior naval officers on the scene, he stepped in and personally directed an amphibious assault on the Virginia coast, a successful operation that led to the capture of Norfolk. The man who knew ""but little of ships"" had transformed himself into one of the greatest naval strategists of his age. <br />Co-winner of the 2009 Lincoln Prize <br />Winner of the 2009 <br />Barondess/Lincoln Prize by the Civil War Round Table of New York<br />John Lyman Award of the North American Society for Oceanic History<br />Daniel and Marilyn Laney Prize by the Austin Civil War Round Table<br />Nevins-Freeman Prize of the Civil War Round Table of Chicago <br />",4.20,448,Hardcover, ,29,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2475329.Lincoln_and_His_Admirals,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2475329.Lincoln_and_His_Admirals

Most of her anxieties seem irrational, nothing that can’t be fixed with the help of some Xanax. But late one stormy summer night, when her husband, Sam, is away on one of his frequent business trips, Claire’s fears come to life. She discovers an intruder has broken into her young daughter’s bedroom. She watches helplessly as he picks up her sleeping child from her bed. Desperate to protect her family, Claire puts herself in the line of fire and utters the plea that will undo her: “Take me instead.”<br /><br />As she drives away in the kidnapper’s car, Claire fears for her children, but not for herself. And she can’t help noticing the reversal in her marriage—for the first time in ten years, Sam will not know where she is.<br /><br />For the next week, Claire is tied to a bed in a strange motel room, the intruder her only companion. She is forced to lie still and contemplate the reasons for this assault on her family. Is this just a random crime, or something more sinister? Has the shadowy past that she tried so hard to leave behind finally caught up with her? Day after day, she goes deeper into herself, reevaluating her marriage and her role as a mother, and unburying the source of her crippling anxiety.

Salinger benchmark ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish,"" Seymour Glass floats his beach mate Sybil on a raft and tells her about these creatures' tragic flaw. Though they seem normal, if one swims into a hole filled with bananas, it will overeat until it's too fat to escape. Meanwhile, Seymour's wife, Muriel, is back at their Florida hotel, assuring her mother not to worry--Seymour hasn't lost control. Mention of a book he sent her from Germany and several references to his psychiatrist lead the reader to believe that World War II has undone him. <p> The war hangs over these wry stories of loss and occasionally unsuppressed rage. Salinger's children are fragile, odd, hypersmart, whereas his grownups (even the materially content) seem beaten down by circumstances--some neurasthenic, others (often female) deeply unsympathetic. The greatest piece in this disturbing book may be ""The Laughing Man,"" which starts out as a man's recollection of the pleasures of storytelling and ends with the intersection between adult need and childish innocence. The narrator remembers how, at nine, he and his fellow Comanches would be picked up each afternoon by the Chief--a Staten Island law student paid to keep them busy. At the end of each day, the Chief winds them down with the saga of a hideously deformed, gentle, world-class criminal. With his stalwart companions, which include ""a glib timber wolf"" and ""a lovable dwarf,"" the Laughing Man regularly crosses the Paris-China border in order to avoid capture by ""the internationally famous detective"" Marcel Dufarge and his daughter, ""an exquisite girl, though something of a transvestite."" The masked hero's luck comes to an end on the same day that things go awry between the Chief and his girlfriend, hardly a coincidence. ""A few minutes later, when I stepped out of the Chief's bus, the first thing I chanced to see was a piece of red tissue paper flapping in the wind against the base of a lamppost. It looked like someone's poppy-petal mask. I arrived home with my teeth chattering uncontrollably and was told to go straight to bed.""</p>",4.17,198,Mass Market Paperback, ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2480426.Nine_Stories,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2480426.Nine_Stories

In The Political Mind, George Lakoff explains why. As it turns out, human beings are not the rational creatures we've so long imagined ourselves to be. Ideas, morals, and values do not exist somewhere outside the body, ready to be examined and put to use. Instead, they exist quite literally inside the brain and they take physical shape there. For example, we form particular kinds of narratives in our minds just like we form specific muscle memories such as typing or dancing, and then we fit new information into those narratives. Getting that information out of one narrative type and into another or building a whole new narrative altogether can be as hard as learning to play the banjo. Changing your mind isn't like changing your body it's the same thing. But as long as progressive politicians and activists persist in believing that people use an objective system of reasoning to decide on their politics, the Democrats will continue to lose elections. They must wrest control of the terms of the debate from their opponents rather than accepting their frame and trying to argue within it. This passionate, erudite, and groundbreaking book will appeal to readers of Steven Pinker and Thomas Frank. It is a fascinating read for anyone interested in how the mind works, how society works, and how they work together.",3.86,304,Hardcover, ,121,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2482199.The_Political_Mind,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2482199.The_Political_Mind

In tracing the way literary representations of them changed through time - from Homer's positive portrayal of their subtle self-presentations to the sharply polarized portrayals of these same subtleties in classical tragedy and oratory - Worman also uncovers a nascent awareness among the Greek writers that style may be used not only to persuade but also to distract and deceive.",3.50,274,Hardcover, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2486917.The_Cast_of_Character,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2486917.The_Cast_of_Character

This book is a record of those seminars, which took the form of informal discussions between Borges, Norman Thomas di Giovanni--his editor and translator, Frank MacShane--then head of the writing program at Columbia, and the students. Borges's prose, poetry, and translations are handled separately and the book is divided accordingly.<p>The prose seminar is based on a line-by-line discussion of one of Borges's most distinctive stories, ""The End of the Duel."" Borges explains how he wrote the story, his use of local knowledge, and his characteristic method of relating violent events in a precise and ironic way. This close analysis of his methods produces some illuminating observations on the role of the writer and the function of literature.</p><p>The poetry section begins with some general remarks by Borges on the need for form and structure and moves into a revealing analysis of four of his poems. The final section, on translation, is an exciting discussion of how the art and culture of one country can be ""translated"" into the language of another.</p><p>This book is a tribute to the brilliant craftsmanship of one of South America's--indeed, the world's--most distinguished writers and provides valuable insight into his inspiration and his method.</p><p></p>",4.00, , , ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2487504.On_Writing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2487504.On_Writing

In ""The Night of the Gun,"" David Carr redefines memoir with the revelatory story of his years as an addict and chronicles his journey from crack-house regular to regular columnist for ""The New York Times."" Built on sixty videotaped interviews, legal and medical records, and three years of reporting, ""The Night of the Gun"" is a ferocious tale that uses the tools of journalism to fact-check the past. Carr's investigation of his own history reveals that his odyssey through addiction, recovery, cancer, and life as a single parent was far more harrowing -- and, in the end, more miraculous -- than he allowed himself to remember. Over the course of the book, he digs his way through a past that continues to evolve as he reports it.<br /><br />That long-ago night he was so out of his mind that his best friend had to pull a gun on him to make him go away? A visit to the friend twenty years later reveals that Carr was pointing the gun.<br /><br />His lucrative side business as a cocaine dealer? Not all that lucrative, as it turned out, and filled with peril.<br /><br />His belief that after his twins were born, he quickly sobered up to become a parent? Nice story, if he could prove it.<br /><br />The notion that he was an easy choice as a custodial parent once he finally was sober? His lawyer pulls out the old file and gently explains it was a little more complicated than that.<br /><br />In one sense, the story of ""The Night of the Gun"" is a common one -- a white-boy misdemeanant lands in a ditch and is restored to sanity through the love of his family, a God of his understanding, and a support group that will go unnamed. But when the whole truth is told, it does not end there. After fourteen years -- or was it thirteen? -- Carr tried an experiment in social drinking. Double jeopardy turned out to be a game he did not play well. As a reporter and columnist at the nation's best newspaper, he prospered, but gained no more adeptness at mood-altering substances. He set out to become a nice suburban alcoholic and succeeded all too well, including two more arrests, one that included a night in jail wearing a tuxedo.<br /><br />Ferocious and eloquent, courageous and bitingly funny, ""The Night of the Gun"" unravels the ways memory helps us not only create our lives, but survive them.",3.78,385,Hardcover, ,791,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2509481.The_Night_of_the_Gun,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2509481.The_Night_of_the_Gun

We go into the homes of suicide bombers and into street-to-street fighting with a battalion of marines. We meet Iraqi insurgents, an American captain who loses a quarter of his men in eight days, and a young soldier from Georgia on a rooftop at midnight reminiscing about his girlfriend back home. A car bomb explodes, bullets fly, and a mother cradles her blinded son.<br /><br />Like no other book, The Forever War allows us a visceral understanding of today’s battlefields and of the experiences of the people on the ground, warriors and innocents alike.

Opposing the common misconceptions that being a philosopher means espousing a set of philosophical beliefs, or being a follower of a particular thinker, Appiah argues that ""the result of philosophical exploration is not the end of inquiry in a settled opinion, but a mind resting more comfortably among many possibilities, or else the reframing of the question, and a new inquiry."" Thinking It Through is organized around eight central topics--mind, knowledge, language, science, morality, politics, law, and metaphysics. It traces how philosophers in the past have considered each subject (how Hobbes, Wittgenstein, and Frege, for example, approached the problem of language) and then explores some of the major questions that still engage philosophers today. More important, Appiah shows us not only what philosophers have thought but how they think, giving us examples we might use in our own attempts to navigate the complex issues that confront any reflective person in the 21st century. <br /> Filled with concrete examples of how philosophers work and written in the liveliest prose, Thinking It Through guides readers through the process of philosophical reflection and enlarges our understanding of the central questions of human life.",3.95,412,Hardcover, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2537925.Thinking_It_Through,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2537925.Thinking_It_Through

He is Willie L. Brown, Jr., and he knows how to get things done in politics, how to work both sides of the aisle to get results. Compared to him, Machiavelli looks meek. And drab.<br /><br />In ""Basic Brown,"" this product of rural, segregated Texas and the urban black neighborhoods of San Francisco tells how he rose through the civil rights movement to become the most potent black politician in America through his shrewd understanding and use of political power and political money. He adapts the lessons he has learned so they can be used by anyone -- black, female, male -- intent on acquiring political power.<br /><br />And this master of the political deal demonstrates why deals are not enough, and that political power grows only when public good is being done. Willie Brown shows how some of the most far-reaching and socially advanced legislation in American history -- like gun control, legalized abortion, gay rights, and school funding -- was carried out under his guidance and on his watch, and tells of the ingenuity, the political machinations, and the personal perseverance that were required to enact what now seems to many to be obvious legislation. These are stories of breathtaking, sometimes hilarious ruses and gambits that show that even the most high-minded legislation needs the assistance of the skills of a shark, which is what Willie Brown often sees himself as.<br /><br />""Basic Brown"" is a compendium of insights and stories on the real forces governing power in American political life that will leave you looking at politics anew.

Unlike so many education 'reforms, ' this is not small-bore stuff. For that reason alone, it's likely to be resisted by defenders of the status quo, even though it's necessary and right for our kids. <br />We owe it to them to make sure this book isn't merely a terrific read; it must become a blueprint for educational transformation."" <br />--Joel Klein, Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education<br /><br />""A brilliant teacher, Christensen brings clarity to a muddled and chaotic world of education.""<br />--Jim Collins, bestselling author of ""Good to Great""<br /><br />According to recent studies in neuroscience, the way we learn doesn't always match up with the way we are taught. If we hope to stay competitive-academically, economically, and technologically-we need to rethink our understanding of intelligence, reevaluate our educational system, and reinvigorate our commitment to learning. In other words, we need ""disruptive innovation.""<br /><br />Now, in his long-awaited new book, Clayton M. Christensen and coauthors Michael B. Horn and Curtis W.

زود در ايستگاه قلهك آژان قد كوتاه صورت سرخي به شوفر اتومبيلي كه آنجا ايستاده بود زن بچه بغلي رانشان داد و گفت:- اين زن مي خواسته برود مازندران اينجا آمده ، او را بشهر برسانيد ثواب دارد .آن زن بي تأمل وارد اتومبيل شد، گوشة چادر سياه را بدندانش گرفته بود ، يك بچه دو ساله در بغلش و دستديگرش يك دستم ال بسته سفيد بود . رفت روي نشيمن چرمي نشست و بچه اش را كه موي بور و قيافه نوبه ايداشت روي زانويش نشاند ، سه نفر نظامي و دو نفر زن كه در اتومبيل بودند با بي اعتنايي باو نگاه كردند ، وليشوفر اص ً لا برنگشت باو نگاه بكند . آژان آمد كنار پنجرة اتومبيل و بآن زن گفت :- ميروي مازندران چه بكني ؟- شوهرم را پيدا بكنم .- مگر شوهرت گم شده ؟- يك ماه است مرا بي خرجي انداخته رفته.- چه ميداني كه آنجاست ؟- كل غلام رفيقش به من گفت.- اگر مردت آنقدر باغيرت است از آنجا هم فرار مي كند ، حالا چقدر پول داري؟- دو تومن و دو هزار.- اسمت چيست ؟- زرين كلاه .- كجائي هستي؟- اهل الويز شهريارم.- عوض اينكه ميخواهي بروي شوهرت را پيدا كني برو شهريار ، حالا فصل انگور هم هست – برو پيش خويشو قومهايت انگور بخور . بيخود مي روي مازندران ، آنجا غريب گور ميشوي ، آنهم با اين حواس جمع كهداري!- بايد بروم .اين جمله آ خر را زرين كلاه با اطمينان كامل گفت ، مثل اينكه تصميم او قطعي و تغيير ناپذير بود ، و نگاه بي نوراو جلوش خيره شد ، بدون اينكه چيزي را ببيند و يا متوجه كسي بشود . بنظر ميآمد كه بي اراده و فكر حرفميزد و حواسش جاي ديگر بود. بعد آژان دوباره رويش را كرد به شوفر و گفت :- آقاي شوفر، اين زن را دم دروازه دولت پياده بكنيد و راه را نشانش بدهيد.زرين كلاه مثل اينكه ازين حمايت آژان جسور شد گفت:- من غريبم ، بمن راه را نشان دهيد ثواب دارد.اتومبيل براه افتاد، زرين كلاه بدون حركت دوباره با نگاه بي نورش مثل سگ كتك خورده جلو خودش را خيرهشد. چشمهاي او درشت ، سياه ، ابروهاي قيطاني باريك ، بيني كوچك ، لبهاي برجسته گوشتالو و گونه هايتورفته داشت . پوست صورتش تازه ، گندمگون و ورزيده بود . تمام راه را در اتومبيل تكان خورد بدون اينكهمتوجه كسي يا چيزي بشود . بچة او ساكت و غمگين بغش د ائم بود، چرت ميزد و يك انار آ بلنبو در دستش بود.نزديك دروازه دولت شوفر اتومبيل را نگهداشت و راهي را كه مستقيمًا بدروازه شميران مي رفت باو نشان داد .زرين كلاه هم پياده شد و ب يدرنگ راه دراز و آفتابي را بچه به بغل و كولباره بدست در پيش گرفت.دم دروازه شمير ان زرين كلاه در يك گاراژ رفت و پس از نيمساعت چانه زدن و معطلي صاحب گاراژ راضي شدسر راه ساري برساند و شش ريال هم بابت كرايه از او گرفت . زرين كلاه را « آسياس » با اتومبيل باركش او را بهبه اتومبيل بزرگي راهنمائي كردند كه دور آن كيپ هم آدم نشسته بود و بار و بن ديلشان را آن ميان چيده بودند .آنها خودشان را بهم فشار دادند و ي كجا براي او باز كردند كه بزحمت آن ميان قرار گرفت.اتومبيل را آبگيري كردند ، بوق كشيد ، از خودش بوي بنزين و روغن سوخته و دود در هوا پراكنده كرد و درجاده گرم خاك آلود براه افتاد . دورنماي اطراف ابتدا يكنواخت بود، سپس تپه ها ، كوه ها و درختهاي دوردست وپيچ و خمهاي راه چشم انداز را تغيير مي داد . ولي زرين كلاه با همان حالت پژمرده جلوش را نگاه ميكرد . درچندين جا اتومبيل نگهداشت و جواز مسافران را تفتيش كردند . نزديك ظهر در شلنبه چرخ اتومبيل خراب شد ودسته اي از مسافران پياده شدند . ولي زرين كلاه از جايش تكان نخورد ، چون مي ترسيد اگر بلند شود جايش رااز دست بدهد . دستمال بستة خودش را باز كرد ، نان و پنير از ميان آن درآورد ، يك تكه نان لترمه با پنير بهپسرش داد و خودش هم چند لقمه خورد . بچه مثل گنجشك ت رياكي بي سروصدا بود، پيوسته چرت ميزد و بنظرمي آمد كه حوصله حرف زدن و حتي گريه كردن را هم نداشت . بالاخره اتومبيل دوباره براه افتاد و ساعتهاگذشت ، از جابن و فيروزكوه رد شد و منظره هاي قشنگ جنگل پديدار گرديد . ولي زرين كلاه همه اين تغييرات رابا نگاه بي نور و بي اعتنا مينگريست و خوشي نهاني ، خوشي مرموزي در او توليد شده ، قلبش تند ميزد ، آزادانهنفس مي كشيد چون به مقصدش نزديك مي شد و فردا گل ببو شوهرش را ميتوانست پيدا بكند ، آيا خانة او چهجور است ، خويشانش چه شكلند و با او چه جور رفتار خواهند كرد ؟ پس از يك ماه مفارقت آيا چطور با گل ببوبرخورد ميكند و چه ميگويد ؟ ولي خودش ميدانست كه جلو گل ببو يك كلمه هم نميتوانست حرف بزند زبانشبي حس ميشد و همة قوايش از او سلب مي شد مثل اين بود كه در گل ببو قوة مخصوصي بود كه هم ة فكر ، ارادهو قواي او را خنثي مي كرد و او تا بع محض گل ببو مي شد . زرين كلاه ميدانست كه برعكس گل ببو او را تهديدخواهد كرد و بعد هم شلاق ، همان شلاق كذائي كه الاغها را با آن ميزد بجان او مي كشيد . اما زرين كلاه برايهمين مي رفت ، همين شلاق را آرزو ميكرد و شايد اص ً لا ميرفت كه ا ز دست گل ببو شلاق بخورد . هواي نمناك ،جنگل ، چشم انداز دلرباي اطراف آن، مردماني كه از دور كار مي كردند ، مردي كه با قباي قدك آبي كنار جادهايستاده بود، انگور ميخورد، خانه هاي دهاتي كه از جلو او ميگذشت همه اينها زرين كلاه را بياد بچگي خودشانداخت.دو سال ميگذشت كه زرين كلاه زن گل ببو شده بود . اولين بار كه زرين كلاه گل ببو را ديد يكروز انگور چينيبود. زرين كلاه با مهر بانو دختر همسايه شان و موچول خانم و خواهرانش خورشيد كلاه و بماني كارشان اينبود كه هر روز دسته جمعي زن و مرد و دخترها در موستان انگور ميچيدند و خوشه هاي درخشان را در لولا ياصندوقهاي چوبي مي گذاشتند ، بعد آن لولاها را ميبردند كنار رودخانة سياه آب زير درخت چنار كهني كه بآندخيل مي بستند و آنجا مادرش با گوهر بانو ، ننه عباس ، خوشقدم باجي ، كشور سلطان ، ادي گلدا د و خدايارصندوقها را به ريش سفيد پرندك ، ماندگار علي تحويل مي دادند درين روز لولاكش تازه وارد كه صندوقها رابارگيري ميكرد گل ببوي مازندراني بود و تصنيفي ميخواند و به دخترها ياد ميداد كه اسباب تفريح همه شد ، وهمة آنها دسته جمعي با هم ميخواندند.گالش كوري آه هاي له له ، »بويشيم بجار آه هاي له له .اي پشته آجار ، دو پشته آجار ،بيا بشيم بجار آه هاي له له ،«. بيا بشيم فاكون تو ميخواهريگل ببو تلفظ آنها را درست ميكرد ، دخترها قهقهه مي خنديدند و تا عصر آنروز اينكار دوام داشت . ولي بيشترچيزيكه گل ببو را طرف توجه دخترها كرد تصنيف او نبود . بلكه خود او و جسارتش بود كه قلب آنها وبخصوص زرين كلاه را تسخير كرد . همينكه زرين كلاه اندام ورزيده ، گردن كلفت ، لبهاي سرخ ، موي بور ،بازوهاي سفيد او كه رويش مو درآمده بود ديد ، و مخصوصًا چالاكي كه در جابجا كردن لوله هاي وزين نشانميداد، خودش را باخت . بعلاوه تمايلي كه گل ببو باو ظاهر كرد با آن نگاه هاي سوزاني كه ميان آنها رد و بدلشد كافي بود زين كلاه را كه دختر چهارده ساله اي بيش نبود فريفتة خودش بكند . زرين كلاه دلش غنج ميزد ،رنگ ميگذاشت و رنگ برميداشت ، در او سابقه نداشت . زيرا تاكنون او از مرد چيز زيادي نميدانست . مادرشهميشه او را كتك زده بود و از او چشم زهر گرفته بود و خواهرانش كه از او بزرگتر بودند با او همچشميميكردند و اسرار خودشان را از او ميپوشيدند . اگرچه زرين كلاه اغلب بفكر مرد م يافتاد ولي جرئت نميكرد كهاز كسي بپرسد و ميدانست كه اين فكر بد است و بايد از آن پرهيز بك ند . فقط گاهي مهربانو دختر همسايه شان وخانم كوچولو و بلوري خانم با او راجع به اسرار مرد حرف زده بودند و زرين كلاه را كنجكاو كرده بودند،بطوريكه تا اندازه اي چشم و گوشش باز شده بود . حتي مهربانو براي او از مناسبات محرمانة خودش با شيرزادپسر ماندگار علي نقل كرده بود ، اما تمام اين افكار را كه زرين كلاه از عشق و شهوت پيش خودش تصور كردهبود نگاه گل ببو تغيير داد . پايش سست شد و احساسي نمود كه ممكن نبود بتواند بگويد . همينقدر ميدانست تمامذرات تنش گل ببو را مي خواست و ازين ساعت محتاج باور بود و زندگي بدون گل بب و برايش غير ممكن و تحملناپذير بود . ولي از حسن اتفاق در آنروز زرين كلاه قباي سرخ نو يي كه داشت پوشيده بود و كلاغي قشنگي كهعمه اش از مشهد برايش آورده بود بسرش پيچيده بود و هفت لنگه گيس بافته از پشت آن بيرون آمده بود .بطوريكه علاوه بر لطافت اندام و حركات و خوشگلي صورت ، لباس او بر زيبائيش افزوده بود گويا بهمينمناسبت بود كه در ميان صدها دختر و آن شلوغي گل ببو برمي گشت و دزدكي باو نگاه ميكرد و لبخند ميزد . وبا زرنگي و موشكافي و احساساتي كه ممكن بود ي ك دختر بچه داشته باشد شكي براي زرين كلاه باقي نماند كهگل ب بو باو مايل است و رابطة مخصوصي ميان آنها توليد شده . آيا در چنين موقع چه بايد بكند ؟ بقدري خونبسرعت در تنش گردش ميكرد كه حس كرد روي گونه هايش گرم شده مثل اينكه آتش شعله ميزد . آنقدر سرخشده بود كه شهربانو دختر كشور سلطان ملتفت او شد . آيا زرين كلاه مي توانست چنين اميدي به خودش بدهدكه زن گل ببو بشود ، در صورتيكه دو خواهر از خودش بزرگتر داشت كه هنوز شوهر نكرده بودند و بعلاوه اواز هر دو آنها پيش مادرش سياه بخت تر هم بود ؟ چون پيش از اينكه بدنيا بيايد پدرش مرد و مادرش پيوسته باوسرزنش ميكرد كه تو سر پدرت را خورده اي و او را بدقدم مي دانست . ولي در حقيقت چون بعد از آنكه زرينكلاه را مادرش زائيد نوبه كرد و دو ماه بستري شد باين علت از او بدش ميآمد.طرف غروب آنروز كه همة كارگرها از كار دست كشيدند و از لابلاي بت ههاي مو كه مثل ريسمانهاي قهوه اي رويپست و بلندي به م بافته شده بود درآمدند و بطرف رودخانه سياه آب رفتند و انگورها را بعادت هر روز بريشسفيد دهشان ماندگار علي تحويل دادند . زرين كلاه و مادرش مهربانو با گوگل كه در راه به آنها برخورد بطرفقلعة گلي خوشان كه برج و باروي بلند داشت رهسپار شدند . در ميان راه زرين كلاه براي مهربانو از عشقخودش به گل ببو صحبت كرد و مهربانو از او دلداري كرد و قول داد هر كمكي از دستش بربيايد دربارة اوكوتاهي نخواهد كرد.چه شب سختي به زرين كلاه گذشت ! شب مهتاب بود ، خوابش نميبرد ، بلند شد كه آب بخورد . بعد رفت درايوان خانه شان . نه ، اص ً لا ميل نداشت بخوابد . نسيم خنكي مي وزيد ، سينه اش باز بود ولي سرما را حسنمي كرد . صداي خر خر مادرش را كه مانند اژدها در اطاق خوابيده بود ميشنيد . هر دقيقه اگر بيدار مي شد او راصدا ميزد ، ولي چه اهميت داشت ؟ چون در تمام وجود خودش احساس شورش و طغيان مي كرد . پاورچينپاورچين رفت دم حوض ، زير درخت نارون ايستاد . درين ساعت مثل اين بود كه درخت ، زمين ، آسمان ،ستاره ها و مهتاب همه با او بزبان مخصوصي حرف ميزدند . يك حالت غم انگيز و گوارائي بود كه تاكنون حسنكرده بود ، او بخوبي زبان درختها ، آبها ، نسيم و حتي ديوارهاي بلند خانه و قلعه اي كه در آن محبوس شده بودو همچنين زبان كوزه ماستي را كه توي پاشويه حوض بود ميفهميد و در خودش حس ميكرد . ستاره ها ماننددانه هاي ژاله كه در هوا پاشيده باشند ، ضعيف و ترسو با روشنائي لرزان ميدرخشيد ، همة آنها و هر چيزمعمولي و بي اهميت بنظر او عجيب ، غير طبيعي و پر از اسرار آمد كه معني دور و مجهول داشت و هرگز بفكر اونميرسيد . بي اراده دست را روي سينه و پستانهايش كشيد و برد تا روي بازويش ، زلفهاي او را نسيم هواپراكنده كرده بود و بالاخره كنار حوض نشست و بغض بيخ گلويش را گرفت و شرو ع كرد بگريه كردن واشكهاي گرم روي گونه هايش جاري شد . اين تن نرم و كمر باريك براي بغل كشيدن گل ببو درست شده بود .پستانهاي كوچكش ، بازويش و همه تنش بهتر بود كه زير گل برود . زير خاك بپوسد تا اين كه در خان ة مادرشبا فحش و بدبختي چين بخورد و پستانهايش بپلاس د و زندگيش بيهوده و بي نتيجه و بي عشق تلف بشود .ميخواست خودش را بخاك بمالد ، پيرهنش را تكه تكه بكند تا از شر اين بغض ، اين بدبختي كه بيخ گلوي او راگرفته بود آسوده بشود . زار زار گريه كرد ، در اينوقت تمام بدبختيهاي دورة زندگيش جلو او مجسم شدفحشهائي كه شن يده بود ، كتكهائي كه خورده بود از همانوقت كه بچة كوچك بود مادرش يك مشت بسر او ميزدو يك تكه نان به دستش ميداد و پشت در خانه شان مينشاند و او با بچه هاي كچل و چشم دردي با زي ميكرد .هرگز يك روي خوش يا كمترين مهرباني از مادرش نديده بود . همه اين بدبختيها ده م قابل بزرگتر و ترسناكتربنظرش ميآمد . باز هم مهربانو و مادرش بودند كه گاهي از او دلجوئي ميكردند و هر وقت مادرش او را ميزدبخانة آنها پناه ميبرد . زرين كلاه اشكهايش را با سرآستينش پاك كرد و حس كرد كه كمي آرام شد . اضطراب وشورش او فروكش كرد احساس آرامش نمود – يكنوع آسايش بي دليل بود كه سر تا پاي او را ناگهان فراگرفت .چشمهايش را بست ، هواي ملايم را استنشاق كرد . ولي صورت گل ببو از جلو چشمش رد نمي شد ، بازوهايقوي او كه لنگه با رهاي ده دوازه مني را مثل پركاه برميداشت و روي الاغ ميگذاشت ، موهاي پاشنه نخواب بور،گردن كلفت سرخ ، ابروهاي پرپشت بهم پيوسته ، ريش پرپشت بهم پيچيده ، حالا او پي برده بود كه دنياي ديگريوراي دنياي محدودي كه او تصور مينمود وجود دارد . بالاخره از حوض يك مشت آب بصورتش زد و برگشتدر رختخوابش خوابيد . اما خواب بچشمش نيامد ، همه اش در رختخواب غلت زد و با خودش نيت كرد كه اگربمقصودش برسد و زن گل ببو بشود همانطوريكه خودش از زندان خانه پدري آزاد مي شود يك كبوتر بخرد وآزاد بكند . و يك شمع هم شب جمعه در امامزاده آغا بي بي سكينه روشن بكند . چون ستاره دختر نايب عبداللهمير آب هم همين نذر را كرده بود و شوهر كرد.صبح روز بعد، زرين كلاه با چشمهاي سرخ بيخوابي كشيده بلند شد و به انگورچيني رفت . سر راه كنار رودخانهسياه آب پاي درخت چنار مراد كه در جوغين بود همانجا كه گل ببو انگورها را باربندي كرده بود ايستاد . از آثارديروزي مقداري برگ مو لگدمال شده و پشگل الاغ و پوست تخمه كدو روي زمين ريخته بود . بعد زرين كلاهدست كرد از كنار يخة پيرهنش يك تريشته درآورد و به شاخة درخت چنار نيت كرد و گره زد ، ولي همينكهبرگشت ، مهربانو باو برخورد و گفت :- چرا امروز منتظر من نشدي ؟ اينجا چكار ميكني؟- هيچ ، من بخيالم هنوز خوابي ، نخواستم بيدارت بكنم . امروز صبح خيلي زود بيرون آمدم.ولي مهربانو حرف او را بريد و گفت :- من ميدانم ، براي گل ببوست !زرين كلاه براي مهربانو درد دل كرد و از بي خوابي خودش و نذري كه كرده بود همه را برايش گفت . با هممشورت كردند و مهربانو باز هم باو دلداري داد و قرار گذاشت با مادرش در اين خصوص مذاكره بكند . چونمادر مهربانو تنها كسي بود كه زرين كلاه را دوست داشت . صبح زرين كلاه هر چه انتظار كشيد گل ببو را نديد، ولي مهربانو خبرش را آورد كه گل ببو در بكه كار مي كند . ظهر كه براي ناهار بخانه برگشتند ، زرين كلاهرفت در اطاق پنج دري و درها را بست و جلو آينة لب بريد ه اي كه در مجري خودش داشت موهايش را مرتبشانه زد و حالتها و حركات صورت خودش را خوب دقت كرد تا براي عصر كه گل ببو را ببيند چه جور بخندد وچه حركتي بكند كه به پسند خودش باشد . بالاخره لبخند مختصري را پسنديد ، چون اگر خندة بلند ميكرددندانهايش كه خوب نبود بيرون ميآمد ، و يك رشته از زلفش را روي پيشانيش انداخت و از روي رضايت لبخندزد. چون خودش را خوشگل و قابل دوست داشتن ديد . مژه هاي بلند ، لبخند دلربا ، صورت بچگانه ساده و خطيكه گوشة لبهايش ميافتاد متناسب بود . سرخي تند روي گونه ها پوست گندمگون چهره اش را بهتر جلوه ميداد وسرخي تر و براق لبها كه برنگ انگور شاهاني بود، و دهن گرم او ، بخصوص چشمها ، آن نگاه گيرنده كه مادرهمة اينها او را از بسياري دختران جوان ديگر ممت از «. چشمهايت سگ دارد » : مهربانو هميشه به او مي گفتميكرد.وقتيكه بعد از ظهر زرين كلاه با مهربانو به انگورچيني برگشت در ته دل خوشحال بود ، زيرا تصميم گرفته بودكه هر طور شده خودش را به گل ببو نشان بدهد . تعجب زرين كلاه بيشتر شد چون گل ببو را آنجا ديد و تمامبعدازظهر در ضمن كار با شوخي و آواز خواندن گذشت . برخلاف روزهاي پيش كه زرين كلاه پژمرده و غمناكبود ، امروز شاد و خرم خوشه هاي انگور را ميچيد و با آن فال ميگرفت . باين ترتيب كه يك حبه انگور را او ميكندو ميخورد و يكدانه را هم مهربانو ، و با خودش نيت ميكرد اگر دانه آخر باو بيفتد بمقصودش خواهد رسيد ، يعنيزن گل ببو ميشود . طرف غروب كه پاي درختان چنار برگشتند گل ببو و زرين كلاه باز چندين بار نگاه رد و بدلكردند . گل ببو به او لبخند زد و زرين كلاه هم جواب لبخند او را داد . همان طوريكه در آينه پسنديده بود و بازبردستي مخصوصي سر خودش را تكان داد و يكرشته از زلفش روي پيشانيش افتاد.تا چهار روز بهمين ترتيب گذشت و هر روز جرئت و جسارت زرين كلاه بيشتر ميشد و ك م كم رابطة مخصوصيبين او و گل ببو برقرار گرديد . تا اينكه روز چهارم مهربانو براي زرين كلاه مژده آورد كه مادرش كار را درستكرده . زرين كلاه از زور شادي روي لبهاي م هربانو را بوسيد، چطور كار را درست كرده بود؟ با كي داخلمذاكره ش ده بود؟ زرين كلاه هيچ لازم نداشت كه بفهمد . همينقدر ميدانست كه بعضي از پيرزنها بيشتر از زندگيتجربه دارند و در برپا كردن عروسي و پا درمياني زبر دست مي باشند و راههائي ميدانند كه هرگز بعقل جوان ا ونميرسيد . حالا ميتوانست بخودش اميد بدهد كه بمقصودش رسيده، ولي چيزيكه مشكل بود رضايت مادر خودشبود كه بمحض رسيدن اين مطلب از جا درميرفت ، ترقه ميشد و از آن فحشها و نفرين هاي آبدار كه ورد زبانشبود باو ميداد . چون روزي سه عباسي مزد زرين كلاه را او ميگرفت . ب الاخره بعد از اصرار و پافشاري مادرمهربانو ، مادرش راضي شد و پس از كشمكشهاي زياد يكدست لباس سرخ براي او گرفت . ولي هر تكه آنرا كهالاهي روي تختة مرده شور خونه بيفتي ، وربپري ، عروسيت عزا بشود ، » : ميبريد نفرين و ناله ميكرد و ميگفتاما «! الاهي دختر جز جگر بزني ، ح سرت بدلت بماند، جوانمرگ بشوي ، با اين شوهر لرپاپتي كه پيدا كرده ايگوش زرين كلاه از اين نفرينها پر شده بود و ديگر در او اثر نميكرد ، يك ديگ مسي و يك سماور برنجي كوچكاز بابت جهاز باو داد . يكروز طرف عصر مادر مهربانو مهماني مفصلي از اهل ده كرد و زنهاي دهاتي شبيهعروسك نخودي ، چارقد بسر و يا ك لاغي زير گلويشان بسته بودند ، همه براي عروسي زرين كلاه جمع شدند .ولي خواهران او خورشيد كلاه و بماني خانم در آن مجلس حاضر نشدند . آخوند ده سيد معصوم را آوردند وزرين كلاه را براي گل ببو عقد كرد. بعد براي شگون رفت بالاي منبر و دو سه دهن روضه خواند. مادرش دستورداد روضة عروسي قاسم را بخواند و همه گريه كردند . وقتي مجلس روضه تمام شد ماندگار علي و پسرششيرزاد ساق دوش داماد شدند . زير بغل او را گرفتند وارد مجلس كردند و او روي صندلي كه شال كشيده شدهبگذاريد پدرم » : بود نشست . آنوقت شيرزاد شروع كرد به پول جمع كردن ، اول رفت جلو پدرش و با لبخند گفتمهربانو كه در سيني دور ميگردانيد آمد سيني را جلوي ماندگار علي نگهداشت و او دو تومان .« را جريمه بكنمدو تمن دادي » : درآورد و در سيني انداخت . فورًا طبالي كه گوشة مجلس نشسته بود روي طبل زد و گفتو بهمين ترتيب در حدود سي تومان براي زرين كلاه جمع كردند و مجلس بخوشي ورگذار شد. .« خونه ات آبادانفردا صبح زرين كلاه از خواهرها و مادرش خدانگهداري كرد . ولي مادرش در عوض اينكه با روي خوش از اوپذيرايي بكند ، تا دم در خانه مثل خوك تير خورده با ص ورت آبله رو كه شبيه پوست هندوانه اي بود كه مرغ تكزده باشد دنبال او آمد و نفرين كرد . بعد زرين كلاه رفت خانة مهربانو از مادر او و خودش خدانگهداري كرد .روي مهربانو را بوسيد و باو سپرد كه شب جمعه يك شمع در آغا بي بي سكينه روشن بكند و يك كبوتر هم آزادبكند . آنوقت زرين كلاه بار و بنديل ، سماور و ديگ مسي را برداشت رفت در ميدان ، پاي درخت چنار مرادهمانجا كه گل ببو چشم به راه او بود سوار الاغ شد و گل ببو هم روي الاغ ديگر نشست و با هم بسوي تهرانروانه شدند . يكشب و يك روز در راه بودند . زرين كلاه از شادي ميخواست پر بگيرد ، بلندبلند حرف ميزد .مهتاب بالا آمد و چندين بار گل ببو دست پر زورش را بگردن او انداخت و ماچهاي محكم از روي لبهايش كرد .طعم دهن او شور مثل طعم اشك چشم بود . گل ببو مخصوصًا اسم زرين كلاه را بفال نيك گرفت چون اسم دهاو در مازندران زرين آباد يا زرين كلا بود و اين تصادف را در اثر قسمت دانست.همينكه به تهران رسيدند ، مدت دو ماه در اطاق كوچكي كه در محلة سرچشمه گرفتند بخوشي گذشت . گل ببوروزها ميرفت سر كار ، زرين كلاه جاروب ميزد ، وصله ميكرد و به كارهاي خانه رسيدگي ميكرد . و شبها را همبا ناز و نوازش مي گذرانيدند . بطوري كه زرين كلاه بچگي خودش ، خواهرانش و مادرش و حتي مهربانو را بكليفراموش كرد . ولي بر پدر رفيق بد لعنت . سر ماه سوم اخلاق گل ببو عوض شد –<br />ولي بر پدر رفيق بد لعنت . سر ماه سوم اخلاق گل ببو عوض شد – هر شب در قهو ه خانة رضاسيبيلو با كل غلام وافور ميكشيد ، خرجي بزنش نميداد . چيزي كه غريب بود بجاي اينكه ترياك او را بي حس وبي اراده بكند ، برعكس مثل يك وسواس و يا ناخوشي تا وارد خانه ميشد شلاق را مي كشيد به جان زرين كلاه واو را خوب شلاقي ميكرد . اول از او ايراد مي گرفت ، آنهم سر چيزهاي جزئي ، مث ً لا مي گفت : چرا گوشة چادرنمازت سوخته ، يا سماور را دير آت ش كردي و يا پريشب آبگوشت را زياد شور كرده بودي ، آنوقت چشمهايدريده بي حالت او را دور ميزد و شلاق سياه چرمي كه سر آن دو گره داشت ، همان شلاقي كه به الاغها ميزددور سرش مي گردانيد و به بازو ، به ران و كمر زرين كلاه مي نواخت . زرين كلاه هم چ ادر نماز را به دورخودش مي پيچيد و آه و ناله مي كرد ، بطوريكه همسايه ها به اطاق آنها مي آمدند و به گل ببو فحش ، نفرين ونصيحت مي كردند . بعد گل ببو يك لگد به زرين كلاه ميزد و شلاق را در طاقچه مي انداخت . ولي ناله ، زنجمورهو گريه يك نواخت و عمدي زرين كلاه ساعتها ادامه داشت . آنوقت گل ببو از روي كيف م ي رفت گوشة اتاقچمباتمه مي نشست ، پشتش را ميداد به صندوق و چپقش را چاق مي كرد . شلوار آبي كوتاه او از سر زانوهايشپائين ميرفت و پاي كشاله رانش جمع مي شد . ساقهاي ورزيده قوي كه بقدر يك وجب آنرا مچ پيچ گرفته بود ، بازنيكه امشب چي داريم » : رانهاي سفيد او كه بيرون مي آمد زرين كلاه را حالي بحالي مي كرد ، بعد گل ببو مي گفتزرين كلاه با ناز و كرشمه بلند مي شد ميرفت ديزي را مي آورد و در باديه مسي خالي مي كرد . نان در باديه «؟تليت مي كردند و با پياز خام مي خوردند و دست شان را با آستر لباسشان پاك مي كردند . فقط وقتي كه زري چراغرا پائين مي كشيد و مي خواستند در رختخواب سرخ كه گلهاي سبز و سياه داشت بخوابند ، گل ببو روي چشمهاياشك آلود شور مزه زرين كلاه را ماچ مي كرد و با هم آشتي مي كردند . اينكار هر شب تكرار مي شد . اگر چهزرين كلاه زير شلاق پيچ و تاب مي خورد و آه و ناله مي كرد ولي در حقيقت كيف م ي برد . خودش را كوچك وناتوان در برابر گل ببو حس مي كرد ، و هر چه بيشتر شلاق مي خورد علاقه اش به گل ببو بيشتر مي شد .مي خواست دستهاي محكم ورزيدة او را ببوسد ، آن گونه هاي سرخ ، گرد ن كلفت ، بازوهاي قوي ، تن پشمالو ،لبهاي درشت گوشتالو ، دندانهاي محكم سفيد ، بخصوص بوي تن او ، بوي گل ببو كه بوي سر طويله را مي داد ،و حركات خشن و زمخت او و مخصوصًا كتك زدنش را از همه بيشتر دوست داشت آيا ممكن بود شوهري بهتراز او پيدا بكند؟ سر نه ماه ز رين كلاه پسري زائيد ، ولي بچه كه بدنيا آمد داغ دو تا خط سرخ به كمرش بود ، مثلجاي شلاق ، و زرين كلاه معتقد بود اين خط ها در اثر شلاقي است كه گل ببو باو ميزد و به بچه انتقال يافته . اماپسرش پيوسته عليل و ناخوش بود ، زرين كلاه اسم مانده علي روي پسرش گذاشت و اين اسم از اسم ماندگارعلي ريش سفيد پرندك باو الهام شد كه روي بچه اش گذاشت تا بماند و پا بگيرد.چندي بعد كاسبي گل ببو كساد شد . يكي از الاغهايش مرد و يكي ديگر را هم فروخت و پول آن هم خرج ترياك ودعا و معالجه نوبه اش شد ، بعد هم بطور غير مترقب بكار ميرفت ، تا اينكه سال بعد پنج تومان خرجي به زرينكلاه داد و گفت كه براي بيست روز مي روم كار و برمي گردم بيست روز او يكماه شد و از يكماه هم چند روزگذشت . اگر چه زرين كلاه عادت به صرفه جوئي داشت و از شكم خودش و بچ ه اش ميزد و كار مي كرد ، ومي توانست يكسال ديگر ، دو سال ديگر هم انتظار بكشد در صورتي كه مطمئن باشد كه گل ببو شوهر اوست وخواهد آمد . چون زرين كلاه گمان مي كرد هر زني كه گل ببو را ببيند طاقت نم ي آورد ، خودش را م ي بازد ، وممكن است خيلي زود شوهرش را رندان از دستش بيرون بياورند . از اينجهت در جستجوي او اقدام كرد . از هرجا و هر كس سراغ گل ببو را گرفت كسي از او خبر نداشت . تا اينكه يك شب رفت دم قهو هخانه رضا سيبيلو ، دررا كه باز كرد بوي دود ترياك بيرون زد ، و سرتاسر صورت هاي زرد ، چشمهاي از كاسه درآمده ، شكلهايباورنكردني با نهايت آزادي افكار رنجور خودشان را در عالم خلسه و لاهوت مي پرورانيدند . زرين كلاه كل غلامرا شناخت ، صدا زد و از او جوياي حال شوهرش شد . كل غلام گفت :- ببو رو ميگي ؟ رفت اونجا كه سال ديگه با برف پائين بياد . تو رو ولكرده ، زنو بچه بهمزده ، رفته دهشزيناباد . به من گفته به كسي سراغشو ندم .- زرين آباد؟- آره زيناباد .شست زرين كلاه خبردار شد كه گل ببو به او حقه زده و از دستش فرار كرده ، رفته در دهش . چون براي اواغلب نقل كرده بود كه خانواده اش در ده زرين آباد سر راه ساري است و در آنجا دو برادر و يك مشت زمين وآب و علف هم دارند . گل ببو از تنبلي كه داشت هميشه آمال و آرزوي خودش را باو گفته بود كه برود آنجا كارنكند . بخورد و بخوابد و بقول خودش : يك خيار بخورد و پايش را بزند كمر ديوار بخوابد . زرين كلاه باو وعدهميداد كه در آنجا برايش كار خواهد كرد . ولي گل ببو سرسر كي جواب او را ميداد . اين شد كه ز رين كلاه تصميمفوري گرفت كه برود مازندران و گل ببو را پيدا بكند . آيا يكماه بس نبود ؟ آيا مي توانست باز هم چشم براه بماند؟دوري گل ببو برايش تحمل ناپذير بود . نفس گرم او ، حرارت تنش ، پشم هاي زمخت و آن بوي سر طويله و حالادر مفارقت و دوري او همة اين خواص بط رز مرموز و دلربائي بنظر زرين كلاه جلوه ميكرد ، و بطور يقين اونميتوانست بدون گل ببو زندگي بكند . هر چه باداباد، او را مي خواست ، اين دست خودش نبود . دو سال ميگذشتكه با او عادت كرده بود و يك ماه بود ، يكماه هم بيشتر كه از شوهرش خبر نداشت .زرين كلاه آرزو مي كرد دوباره گل ببو را پيدا بكند تا با همان شلاقي كه الاغهايش را ميزد او را شلاقي بكند ، ودوباره يا فقط يكبار ديگر او را همانطوريكه گاز ميگرفت و فشار ميداد در آغوشش بكشد . جاي داغهاي كبودشلاق كه روي بازويش بود، روي اين داغها را ميبوسيد و بصورتش ميماليد و ه مه يادگارهاي گذشته بطرزافسونگري بنظر او جلوه ميكرد . ميخواست سر تا پاي گل ببو را ببوسد ، ببويد، نوازش بكند . كاريكه هيچوقتجرئت نكرده بود حالا بقدر و قيمت او پي برده بود ! همين كه گل ببو با دستهاي زبر او را روي سينه خودشفشار مي داد، حالت گوارائي باو دست م يداد كه نميشد بيان كرد . ابروهاي بهم پيوسته پرپشت، مژه هاي زمخت وريش از آن زمخت تر قرمز رنگ حنا بسته ، كه مثل چوب جارو از صورتش بيرون زده بود ، بيني بزرگ ،گونه هاي سرخ ، غبغب زير چانه ، نفس گرم سوزانش با سر تراشيده ، دهن گشاد ، لب هاي سرخ ، وقتيكه لواشكميخورد آرواره هايش مثل سنگ آسيا رويهم مي لغزيد و دندانهاي سفيد محكمش را در آن فرو ميبرد، چشمهايدرشت بي حالت او برق ميزد ، شقيقه هايش تكان مي خورد . اين قيافه كه اگر بچه در تاريكي ميديد ميترسيد وگمان ميكرد غول بي شاخ و دم است بچشم زرين كلاه قشنگترين سره ا بود . برعكس ياد خانه شان كه ميافتادتنش ميلرزيد . آن فحش ها كه خورده بود ، تو سري ، نفرين ، هيچ دلش نمي خواست دوباره به آن نكبت و ذلتبرگردد . آيا گل ببو فرشته نجات او نبود؟ ولي تنها كسي كه دوست داشت مهربانو دختر همساي ه شان بود كهبي ميل نبود او را ببيند ، اما هرگز نميخواست كه بخان هشان برگردد ، آن صورتهاي پير ، اخلاقهائي كه بدتر شدهبود، هيچ دلش نميخواست آنها را ببيند و مرگ را صد بار به آن ترجيح مي داد تا دوباره به الويز برگردد . يادشافتاد كه روز عروسيش كشور سلطان داريه ميزد و ميخواند :خونه بابا نون و انجيل خونه شوور چوغ و زنجيل ، »«! ايشالا مباركبادازرين كلاه چوب و زنجير خانه شوهر را به نان و انجي ر خانة پدرش ترجيح ميداد و حاضر بود گوشة كوچهگدائي بكند و به آنجا نرود ، نه ، هنوز نفرينهاي مادرش ، ر وز عروسيش كه دستور داد روضه عروسي قاسم رابخوانند و هق هق گريه كرد فراموش نكرده بود . آن دستهاي استخواني خال كوبي كه به اجاق خانه شان ميزد ،همين اجاق گرم بگيردت . » : مثل اينكه با قواي مجهولي حرف ميزد و كمك ميخواست . باو نفرين ميكرد و ميگفتبعد هم آنجا باز امر و نهي بشنود ، چپ بجنبد هزار جور فحش ، « … الاهي جز جگر بزني . عروسيت عزا بشودمگر من نگفتم كه اين تيكه از دهن تو زياد است » : راست بجنبد هزار جور تهمت . آنوقت باو سركوفت بزند بگويدو هي از آن فحشهاي آبدار باو بدهد ! زرين كلاه از اين فكر « . ؟ تو لايق نيستي ، گل ببو براي تو شوهر نمي شودچندشش شد . نه ، او هر ذلتي را ترجيح ميداد بر اينكه به خانة مادرش برگردد.از اين رو زرين كلاه نمي خواست اين فكر را بخودش راه بدهد كه ديگر گل ببو را نخواهد ديد ، تنها گل ببو بودكه مي توانست نگاه بي نورش را روشن بكند ، و جان تازه اي در كالبد پژمردة او بدمد . بهر قيمتي كه بودمي خواست او را پيدا بكند . بر فرض هم كه زن ديگر گرفته باشد يا او را نخواهد ، ولي همينقدر در نزديكي او كهبود برايش كافي بود . و اگر سر راه گل ببو گدائي هم ميكرد . اقلا روزي يكبار او را ميديد . اگر ا و را ميزد ، ازخودش ميراند ، تحقير مي كرد باز بهتر از اين بود كه بخان هاش برگردد. نميتوانست ، زور كه نبود ، ساختمان اواينطور درست شده بود . بچه اش مانده علي هم يك وجودي بود كه هيچ انتظارش را نداشت و علاقه اي براي اوحس نمي كرد . همانطوريكه مادر خودش براي او علاقه اي نشان نداده بود . ولي عجالتًا احتياج به وجود او پيداكرده بود. چون شنيده بود كه بچه ميخ ميان قيچي است و حالا بايد با اين اسلحه كه در دست داشت اميدوار بود .شايد بتواند اين محبت از هم گسيخته را بوسيله بچه اش دوباره جوش بدهد ، باو غذاهاي خوب ميخور انيد ،برايش ميوه ميگرفت تا باو عادت بگيرد . و علاقه كمي كه براي بچه اش داشت از اينجهت بود كه موي سرشبرنگ موي گل ببو بود . و براي اينكه بچه گريه نكند و بهانه نگيرد ، يك گلوله كوچك ترياك باو ميداد و بچه باچشمهاي خمار دائم در چرت بود . زرين كلاه اطمينان داش ت كه پرسان پرسان گل ببو را پيدا خواهد كرد و قلبش، ميل و احساساتش باو ميگفت كه بمقصودش خواهد رسيد ، اين ميل و فراست طبيعي كه هيچوقت او را گولنزده بود.همانروزيكه تصميم گرفت دنبال شوهرش برود ، يك شمع به سقاخانه نزديك منزلشان نذر كرد تا گل ببو را پيدابكند ، بعد سماور برنجي و ديگ مسي كه تمام جهاز او بود به سه تومان و چهار قران فروخت . دوازده قرانقرض خودش را بدكاندارهاي محله شان داد ، دو تومان و دو قران ديگرش را براي خرج سفرش برداشت . هر چهخرده ريز داشت در يك مجري كهنه ريخت و گرو قرضش آنرا به صاحبخانه به ا مانت گذاشت . بعد در يك بغچهدو پيرهن و يكدست لباس براي مانده علي با قدري نان و پنير و دو تيكه لواشك از همان لواش ك هائي كه گل ببوآنقدر خوب ميخورد گذاشت ، و پس از سه روز دوندگي براي مازندران جواز گرفت . فردايش صبح خنكا براهافتاد ، ولي از حواس پرتي كه داشت بجاي اينكه براي مازندران اتومبيل بگيرد ، اشتباهًا بشميران رفت و آژانآنجا اتومبيل را برگردانيد و دوباره دم دروازه شميران براي مازندران اتومبيل گرفت .در شاهي اتومبيل ايست كرد ، هوا كم كم تاريك مي شد . ساختمانهاي تازه ساز ، آمد و رفت مردم سبزه مردهائيكه ق باي آبي ، گيوه و تنبان آبي پوشيده بودند درست شبيه گل ببو بودند . دو نفر از مسافران آنجا پياده شدند وقدري جا باز شد . دوباره اتومبيل براه افتاد . هوا نمناك ، گرفته و تاريك شده بود . زرين كلاه آرامش و خوشيمرموزي در خودش حس ميكرد مثل خوشي كسيكه بدون پول ، بد ون اميد و بدون آتيه لنجاره كش در يك شهرغريب ميرود . تنش خسته ، لبش تشنه بود و كمي احساس گرسنگي ميكرد . ولي حركت و صداي يكنواختاتومبيل ، هواي تاريك ، آدمهائي كه دور او چرخ مي زدند . صداي نفس يكنواخت پسرش بخصوص خستگي او راوادار بچرت زدن كرد . وقتيكه بيدار شد در شهر ساري بود . دستمال بسته اش را برداشت ، بچ هاش را بغل گرفتو از اتومبيل پياده شد . شهر در تاريكي و خاموشي فرو رفته بود مثل اينكه خان هها ، درختها و سبز هها از دود يادودة سياه نرم و موقتي درست شده بود . صداي ناله مرغي از دور فاصله بفاصله خاموشي را مي شكست ، يكناله شكوه آميز دوردست بود . چراغها از دور سوسو ميزدند ، در ايوان بالا خانه اي يك دختر با چادر سفيدايستاده بود . اما زرين كلاه هيچ اطراف خودش را نگاه نيمكرد و صداي ديگري را بجز صداي گل ببو نمي شنيد وچيز ديگري بچز صورت گل ببو جلو چشمش نبود . دم بقالي دو نفر نشسته بودند از آنها سراغ زرين آباد راگرفت . يكي از آنها گفت كه سر راه ساري است . يك كاسه آب آنجا بود آنرا برداشت و سر كشيد . بدون جا وبدون اراده كمي دور رفت زيرا هيچ جا و هيچكس را نمي شناخت . ولي با وجود همة اينها چون مطمئن بود كهنزديك تر به گل ببو است اضطراب او از بين رفته بود . و اينجا بنظرش خودماني و مهمان نواز ميآمد . بالاخره ازگوشة چارقدش يكقران در آورد نان تازه با سبزي و شيره خ ريد و رفت جلوي در خانه اي پائين چراغ نشست ،دستمال بسته اش را باز كرد شامش را خورد و به پسرش هم داد . بعد بلند شد رفت زير يك طاقي خوابيد . صبحزود كه بيدار شد رفت در ميدان شهر و پس از يكساعت چانه زدن الاغي را به چهار قران و دهشاهي طي كرد تااو را به زرين آباد برساند، سوار شد ، هوا ابر ، موذي سمج بغض كرده بود و تهديد مرموز و ساكتي

وبوي پرك و كثافت گرفته بود، دوباره براه افتادند . زرين كلاه مانده علي را ببغلش چسبانيده بود و فقط جلويپاي الاغ را خيره نگاه ميكرد . قلبش م يزد و همه اش به فكر اولين برخوردي بود كه با گل ببو خواهد كرد

كسينمي توانست پول را از گوشه چارقد او بزند بدون اينكه بفهمد . آيا فراموش كرده بود و يا تقصير گيجي و حواسپرتي او بود؟ همة اينها ممكن بود ولي عجالتًا دردش دوا نمي شد . بعد از داد و بيداد خركچي كه لهجه تركيداشت دستمال بستة او را از دستش گرفت و الاغش را سوار شد و هي كرد و رفت . ولي باز هم چه اهميتيداشت . آيا زرين كلاه بمقصودش نرسيده بود، آيا در نزديكي گل ببو و در ده او نبود ؟ حالا ميرود خانة گل ببورا پيدا مي كند ، شرح مسافرت خودش را مي دهد و كارش يكطرفه م ي شود. هزارها تومان ازين پولها فداي يكموي ببو ! دور خويش را نگاه كرد ، اين دهكدة كوچك منظره تو سري خورده و پست افتاده داشت و در ته يكدره واقع شده بود . دور آنرا كشتزارهاي حاصلخيز گرفته بود . و مثل اين بنظر ميآمد كه دهكده و مردمش همهازين « … ببو… ببو هو » : بخواب رفته بودند . يك سگ گله از دور پارس ميكرد و صداي مردي ميآمد كه ميگ فتاسم دل زرين كلاه تو ريخت ، ولي ديد مردي كه بطرف او مي رود ببو نيست . زير چهار ديوار دو غاز چرتمي زدند و يك مرغ با دقت تمام با چنگالش خاك را زير و رو ميكرد ، پخش مي كرد و در آن چينه جستجو ميكرد .روي خاكروبه يك سطل شكسته و يك تكه پارچه سبز پاره و پوست خيار افتاده بود . كمي دورتر دو مرغ كزكرده بودند و هر كدام يك پايشان را زير بالشان گرفته بودند . زمزمة آهسته اي كه از گلوي تازه گنجشك ها درميآمد موقتًا حالت خودماني و تر و تازه به آنجا داده بود . در ميدان سه تا پسر بچه دهاتي با دهن ب ازمانده باونگاه ميكردند . يك پيرمرد كنار دكان عطاري روي تيرها نشسته بود و يكدسته مرغابي وحشي با جار و جنجالبه شكل خط زنجير روي آسمان پرواز ميكردند . زرين كلاه پيش پيرمرد رفت و گفت :- خانه بابا فرخ كجاست؟او با دستش خانة نسبتً ا بلندي را كه از دور پيدا بود نشان داد و گفت :. - آن سره را هارش اتا مهتابي درانه همانجوئه 1زرين كلاه پسرش را بغل زد و با يكدنيا اميد بطرف آن خانه رفت . همينكه جلو خانه رسيد در زد ، و زن مسني كهصورت آبله رو داشت دم در آمد :- كره كاردارني ؟- گل ببو را ميخواستم ببينم .- وره چكار دارني ؟- من زن گل ببو هستم از تهرون آمده ام . اينهم مانده علي پسرش است .- خوب ، خوب ، گل ببو آن زنا را ول ها كرده وره طلاق هدائه ، بيخود گني .بعد رويش را كرد بطرف حياط و داد زد:1 آن خانه را نگاه كن ، يك مهتابي دارد ، همانجاست .- ببو هو … ببو هو …هيكل نتراشيده گل ببو با پيراهن يخه باز ، پشت چشم باد كرده و خواب آلو د دم در پيدا شد كه يكمشت پشم ازتوي گلويش بيرون زده بود ، و زن زرد لاغري با چشمهاي درشت كنار او آمد و خودش را به گل ببو چ س بانيد .داغ شلاق به بازو و پيشاني او ديده ميشد ، ميلرزيد بازوي گل ببو را گرفته بود مثل اينكه مي ترسيد شوهرش رااز دست او بگيرند . همينكه گل ببو را زرين كلاه ديد فرياد زد :ببو جان ، ببو … من آمدم . -»ولي گل ببو باو نگاه كرد و گفت :- برو ، برو ، من ترا نمي شناسم .آن پيرزن به ميان آمد و گفت :- مه ريكا جانه جاچي خواني ؟ بي حيا زنا خجالت نكش ني ، ته اين وچه را مول ها كردي اما خواني مه ريكايگردين بنگني؟ 2«. گل ببو گفت : - حواست پرت است عوضي گرفته ايزرين كلاه هاج و واج مانده بود . ولي اين انكار گل ببو را پيش بيني نكرده بود . از اين حركت احساس تنفري دراو توليد شده بود كه همه محاسن گل ببو را فراموش كرد و با لحن تمسخر آميز گفت:- پس بچه ات را بگير بزرگ كن ، من هيچ خرجي ندارم.مادر گل ببو گفت : - اين وچه بيج تخمه ، من چه دوميه ته ورده از كجا بيوردي؟ 3زرين كلاه فهميد كه قافيه را باخته است ، نگاه خودش را بصورت گل ببو دوخت ولي صورت او خشمناك وچشمهايش بحالت درنده اي بود كه تاكنون در او سراغ نداشت . حالتي بود كه نشان مي داد زندگيش تأمين شده ،2 از جان پسرم چه مي خواهي ؟ زن بيحيا خجالت نميكشي ، اين بچه تو حرامزاده است حالا ميخواهي به گردن پسرم بيندازي؟3 اين بچه حرامزاده است من چه مي دانم تو آنرا از كجا آورد هاي ؟ارباب شده و به آرزوي خودش رسيده ، نميخواهد بخودش دغدغه راه بدهد و از نگاه تحقيرآميزي كه باو ميكردپيدا بود كه اص ً لا حاضر نيست او را ببيند . زرين كلاه فهميد كه اصرار زياد بيهوده است ، و با حسرت جايشلاقهاي تن زن جوا ني كه خودش را به گل ببو چسبانيده بود نگاه كرد بعد با يك حركت از روي بي ميليبرگشت. در صورتيكه كاس آغا مادر گل ببو ، شبيه مادر خودش دستهاي استخواني را تكان ميداد و بزباني كهنميفهميد فحش و نفرين ميكرد . زرين كلاه با گامهاي آهسته به طرف ميدان برگشت . ولي در راه فكري ازخاطرش گذشت، ايستاد و بچ هاش را كه چرت ميزد جلو در خانه اي گذاشت و باو گفت :- ننه جون تو ايجا بيشين ، من برمي گردم .بچه آرام و فرمانبردار مثل عروسك پنبه اي آنجا نشست . ولي زرين كلاه ديگر خيال نداشت كه برگردد و حتيماچ هم به بچه اش نكرد . چون اين بچه به درد او نمي خورد ، فقط يك بار سنگين و نانخوار زيادي بود و حالا آنرااز سرش باز كرد . همانطوريكه او را گل ببو وازده بود و مادر خودش او را رانده بود ، همانطوريكه مهر مادريرا از مادرش آموخته بود ، نه ، او احتياجي به بچه اش نداشت ، دستش بكلي خالي شد ، ب دون يك شاهي پول ،بدون بچه ، بدون بار و بنديل بود ، نفس راحت كشيد . حالا او آزاد بود و تكليف خودش را م يدانست . به ميدانكه رسيد دورش را نگاه كرد . پيرمرد هنوز روي تيرهاي كنار دكان نشسته بود ، چرت ميزد . مثل اين بود كهتمام عمرش را روي اين تيرها گذرانيده بو د و همانجا پير شده بود . آن سه بچه دهاتي نزديك دكان خاكبازيميكردند . همه با بي اعتنائي مشغول كار خودشان و گذرانيدن وقت بودند و خروس لاري بزرگي كه او نديده بودبالهايش را بهم زد و با صداي دو رگه ميخواند . كسي برنگشت به او نگاه بكند . مثل اين بود كه زندگي بهپيش آمدهاي او هيچ اهميتي نيمگذاشت . آيا چه بسرش خواهد آمد؟ بي باعث و باني هر چه زودتر مي خواست فراربكند كه اقلا از دست بچه بگريزد . حالا همه بارهاي مسئوليت از روي دوش او برداشته شده بود . هوا گرم ،نمناك و دم كرده بود و هرم گرمي مثل هاي دهن آدم ت بدار در هوا پيچيده بود. بي اراده ، بي نقشه با قدمهاي تندزرين كلاه از جلو خانه ها و كوچه ها گذشت . همينكه كنار كشت زارها و سبزه ها رسيد شاهراهي كه جلوش بوددر پيش گرفت . ولي در همينوقت مرد جواني را ديد شلاق بدست ، قوي ، سرخ و سفيد سوار الاغي بود و يك الاغهم جلو او مي دويد و زنگوله ها به گردن آنها جينگ جينگ صدا مي كرد ، همينكه نزديك او شد زرين كلاه به اوگفت :- اي جوان ثواب دارد .آن مرد الاغش را نگهداشت و گفت :- چي خواني ؟- من غريبم ، كسي را ندارم . مرا هم سوار كن .با دست الاغش را نگهداشت . پياده شد و زرين كلاه را سوار كرد . خودش هم روي الاغ ديگر جست زد ، ولياص ً لا برنگشت به صورت او نگاه بكند . بعد شلاق را دور سرش چرخانيد به كپل اسب زد . زنگوله ها جينگ جينگصدا كردند و براه افتادند . از كنار جوزار كه ميگذشتند آن جوان دست كرد يك ساقه جو كند بدهنش گذاشت و بهآهنگ مخصو صي كه به گوش زرين كلاه آشنا آمد سوت زد . اين همان آهنگي بود كه گل ببو در موقعانگورچيني ميخواند، همان روزي بود كه در موستان باو برخورد:گالش كوري آه هاي له له ، »بوشيم بجار آه هاي له له .اي پشته آجار ، دو پشته آجار ،بيا بشيم بجار آه هاي له له .«! بيا بشيم فاكون تو ميخواهريزرين كلاه تمام زندگيش ، جوانيش ، نفرين مادرش ، بعد آن شب مهتاب كه با گل ببو به تهران ميآمد ، نفرين مادرگل ببو همه از جلوش گذشت . اگر چه تشنه و گرسنه بود ولي ته دلش خوشحال شد . نميدانست چرا سوار شد وشايد اين جوان هم عادت به شلاق زدن داشته باشد و » : بكجا مي رود ، ولي با وجود همة

These filmmakers battle the greatest odds a modern artist can face: the opposition of mass culture at large and a medium that requires enormous expenditures in every stage of production and distribution.

In<i> The Geopolitics of Emotion</i> Dominique Moïsi, a leading authority on international affairs, demonstrates that our post-9/11 world has become divided by more than cultural fault lines between nations and civilizations. Moïsi brilliantly chronicles how the geopolitics of today is characterized by a “clash of emotions,” and how cultures of fear, humiliation, and hope are reshaping the world.<br /><br />Moïsi contends that both the United States and Europe have been dominated by fears of the “other” and of their loss of a national identity and purpose. Instead of being united by their fears, the twin pillars of the West are more often divided by them—or, rather, by bitter debates over how best to confront or transcend them. For Muslims and Arabs, the combination of historical grievances, exclusion from the economic boon of globalization, and civil and religious conflicts extending from their homelands to the Muslim diaspora have created a culture of humiliation that is quickly devolving into a culture of hatred. Meanwhile, Asia has been able<b> </b>to concentrate on building a better future and seizing the economic initiative from the American-dominated West and so creating a new culture of hope.<br /><br />Do these emotions represent underlying cultural tendencies characteristic of particular regions and populations today? How will these varying emotions influence the political, social, and cultural conflicts that roil our world? How can the West transcend its fear and avoid sliding into protectionism or militarism? What can the Muslim world do to overcome is legacy of humiliation? Will China and India manage to maintain their status as the cultures of hope? And what will the effect of the world economic crisis be? By delineating the necessity of confronting emotions to understand our changing world and deciphering the driving emotions behind our cultural differences,<i> The Geopolitics of Emotion</i> presents a provocative new perspective on globalization.",3.62,192,Hardcover, ,31,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2575587-the-geopolitics-of-emotion,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2575587-the-geopolitics-of-emotion

And that was the service that Andrew Rusk had found a way to provide. Like any quality product, it did not come cheap. Nor did it come quickly. And perhaps most important of all, it was not for those with weak constitutions. Demand was high, of course, but few people were truly suitable clients. It took a deep-rooted hatred to watch your spouse die in agony, knowing that you had brought about that pain. But on the other hand, some people bore up remarkably well.”<br /><br />With these words, New York Times bestselling author Greg Iles returns to his trademark Southern milieu in this terrifying thriller, an unnerving tale of evil lurking beneath the veneer of idyllic suburban life. Brimming with the masterful suspense and intense psychological drama that made Turning Angel, Blood Memory, and The Quiet Game bestsellers, True Evil tells the chilling story of a divorce attorney who may be orchestrating the deaths of his clients’ spouses, bringing new meaning to the phrase “’til death do us part.”<br /><br />Dr. Chris Shepard is thirty-six years old, newly married, and well on his way to a perfect life. Or so he believes. But that future is forever cast into doubt the day Special Agent Alexandra Morse walks into his office and drops a bombshell: Dr. Shepard’s beautiful new wife is plotting his murder. Shepard is so shocked that he almost throws Agent Morse out of his office. Yet once he is alone, doubt begins to gnaw at him. Paranoia magnifies the small cracks in his marital relationship, and soon he can have no peace unless he knows the truth. When Agent Morse reappears, Chris agrees to act as bait to help her unravel the divorce lawyer’s scheme, which may already have cost nine unsuspecting spouses their lives.<br /><br />At the center of the mystery lies a maddeningly simple question: If these people really were murdered, why can’t the FBI prove it? Rigorous autopsies have uncovered no forensic evidence of foul play, and the police believe no crimes have occurred. As Dr. Shepard and Agent Morse struggle against an invisible adversary, Shepard realizes that he’s working with a desperate woman. The reason: the killer’s last known victim was Alex Morse’s sister, who from her deathbed accused her husband of murder and extracted a vow that Alex save her ten-year-old nephew from his father. This has driven Alex to risk both her life and her career to fulfill that vow. But Chris Shepard soon feels desperation of his own. As he probes his wife’s hidden past, he is confronted by the probability that the woman he loves wants him dead.<br /><br />He has adopted her son and given her everything he has to give, and yet somewhere out there, a killer with the brilliance to outwit the top forensic scientists in the world is closing in on him.<br /><br />Who is this merciless assassin? Why is murder an art form for him? And what clues could exist to lead them to a man of such twisted talents? Not even the clients who hire him know his identity, and the lawyer who works with him fears him above all else. Most terrifying, those who choose murder over divorce soon learn a terrible truth: once set in motion, the instrument of their anger cannot be stopped.",4.09,6,Audio CD,Abridged,19,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2575908-true-evil,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2575908-true-evil

In <em>Havana Nocturne</em>, T.J. English offers a multifaceted true tale of organized crime, political corruption, roaring nightlife, revolution &amp; international conflict that interweaves the dual stories of the Mob in Havana &amp; the event that would overshadow it, the Cuban Revolution.<br /><br />As the Cuban people labored under a violently repressive regime throughout the 50s, Mob leaders Meyer Lansky &amp; Charles ""Lucky"" Luciano turned their eye to Havana. To them, Cuba was the ultimate dream, the greatest hope for the future of the US Mob in the post-Prohibition years of intensified government crackdowns. But when it came time to make their move, it was Lansky, the brilliant Jewish mobster, who reigned supreme. Having cultivated strong ties with the Cuban government &amp; in particular the brutal dictator Fulgencio Batista, Lansky brought key mobsters to Havana to put his ambitious business plans in motion. <br /><br />Before long, the Mob, with Batista's corrupt government in its pocket, owned the biggest luxury hotels &amp; casinos in Havana, launching an unprecedented tourism boom complete with the most lavish entertainment, the world's biggest celebrities, the most beautiful women &amp; gambling galore. But their dreams collided with those of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara &amp; others who would lead the country's disenfranchised to overthrow their corrupt government &amp; its foreign partners—an epic cultural battle that English captures in all its sexy, decadent, ugly glory. <br /><br />Bringing together long-buried historical information with English's own research in Havana—including interviews with the era's key survivors—<em>Havana Nocturne</em> takes readers back to Cuba in the years when it was a veritable devil's playground for mob leaders. English deftly weaves together the parallel stories of the Havana Mob—featuring notorious criminals such as Santo Trafficante Jr &amp; Albert Anastasia—&amp; Castro's 26th of July Movement in a riveting, up-close look at how the Mob nearly attained its biggest dream in Havana—&amp; how Fidel Castro trumped it all with the revolution.",3.91,416,Hardcover, ,441,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2578863-havana-nocturne,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2578863-havana-nocturne

Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation's history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo's firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States.<br /><br />In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo's past--memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the <em>Clotilda</em>, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War.<br /><br />Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo's unique vernacular, and written from Hurston's perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, <em>Barracoon</em> masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it.

His family's fate continues to haunt him, however, and he sifts through his memories to try to make sense of his loss. Finally, in the late 1930s, he returns to Shanghai to solve the most important case of his life. But as Christopher pursues his investigation, the boundaries between fact and fantasy begin to evaporate. Is the Japanese soldier he meets really Akira? Are his parents really being held in a house in the Chinese district? And who is Mr. Grayson, the British official who seems to be planning an important celebration? ""My first question, sir, before anything else, is if you're happy with the choice of Jessfield Park for the ceremony?

Sherlock Holmes needed only fragments--a muddy shoe, cigarette ash on a sleeve--to make his deductions, but all Christopher has are fading recollections of long-ago events, and for him the truth is much harder to grasp. Ishiguro writes in the first person, but from the beginning there are cracks in Christopher's carefully restrained prose, suggestions that his version of the world may not be the most reliable. Faced with such a narrator, the reader is forced to become a detective too, chasing crumbs of truth through the labyrinth of Christopher's memory. </p><p> Ishiguro has never been one for verbal pyrotechnics, but the unruffled surface of this haunting novel only adds to its emotional power. <i>When We Were Orphans</i> is an extraordinary feat of sustained, perfectly controlled imagination, and in Christopher Banks the author has created one of his most memorable characters. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>",3.50,400,Paperback, ,27,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2590839,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2590839

As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide—for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul. <br /><br />A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life—and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete—and her time on earth will be finished. <br /><br />Already an international literary sensation, the Gargoyle is an Inferno for our time.

I wish it hadn't. But would I change who I married. . . . Never.""<br /></strong>--Dana Reeve He was a hero in every sense of the word--the chiseled-from-granite star of four blockbuster <em>Superman</em> films and the romantic classic <em>Somewhere in Time</em> who, after being paralyzed in a freak horseback riding accident, became a symbol of hope for millions. Dana Reeve was no less heroic, standing steadfastly by her husband's side until his surprisingly sudden and unexpected death at age fifty-two. When Dana, a non-smoker, passed away from lung cancer just seventeen months after Chris's death, she left behind their thirteen-year-old son, Will, to be raised by friends and family. Dana was only forty-four years old. That fate could have dealt such a cruel hand to this golden couple seemed unfathomable. That they could endure it all with grace, courage, and humor defied belief. Yet for all the millions of words that have been written about their public causes and private struggles following Chris's accident, little is known about the lives they led as passionate young lovers. Now, in the manner of his poignant-yet-stirring bestsellers <em>Jack and Jackie, Jackie After Jack, An Affair to Remember, The Day Diana Died, After Diana</em>, and <em>The Day John Died</em>, No. l <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Christopher Andersen draws on those who knew them best to examine in touching detail the Reeves' unique partnership and the romance, faith, and fortitude that defined it. Sometimes heartbreaking, often uplifting, always compelling, <em>Somewhere in Heaven</em> is more than just a portrait of a marriage. It is the profoundly human story of two souls whose brief lives made a difference, a bittersweet saga of tragedy, triumph, and loss, and--above all else--a love story for the ages.",4.08,256,Hardcover, ,100,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2600805-somewhere-in-heaven,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2600805-somewhere-in-heaven

Why didn't Spain enter World War II? In what ways did Spain collaborate with the Third Reich? How much did Spain assist Jewish refugees?<br /><br /> <br /><br />This is the first book in any language to answer these intriguing questions. Stanley Payne, a leading historian of modern Spain, explores the full range of Franco’s relationship with Hitler, from 1936 to the fall of the Reich in 1945. But as Payne brilliantly shows, relations between these two dictators were not only a matter of <i>realpolitik</i>.  These two titanic egos engaged in an extraordinary tragicomic drama often verging on the dark absurdity of a Beckett or Ionesco play.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Whereas Payne investigates the evolving relationship of the two regimes up to the conclusion of World War II, his principal concern is the enigma of Spain’s unique position during the war, as a semi-fascist country struggling to maintain a tortured neutrality. Why Spain did not enter the war as a German ally, joining with Hitler to seize Gibraltar and close the Mediterranean to the British navy, is at the center of Payne’s narrative. Franco’s only personal meeting with Hitler, in 1940 to discuss precisely this, is recounted here in groundbreaking detail that also sheds significant new light on the Spanish government’s vacillating policy toward Jewish refugees, on the Holocaust, and on Spain’s German connection throughout the duration of the war.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> ",3.71,336,Hardcover, ,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2611906-franco-and-hitler,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2611906-franco-and-hitler

A central component of terroir is the soil and its immediate surroundings. Thus, an understanding of the basic properties of soils and how they function as a ""living skin"" on the earth's surface is of fundamental importance to grape growers and winemakers. Stripped of scientific jargon, Understanding Vineyard Soils explains to a wide audience how soils form and why they are so variable. Robert White describes essential chemical and physical processes involving nutrients, water, oxygen and carbon dioxide, moderated by the activities of soil organisms, and proposes remedies to alleviate adverse conditions such as soil acidity, compaction, poor drainage and salinity. The pros and cons of organic viticulture are discussed, as are the possible impacts of climate change. The author explains how sustainable wine production requires grape growers and winemakers to take care of the soil and minimize the impact of their activities on the environment. This book is a practical guide for viticulturists and for the lay reader who is seeking general information about soils, but who may also wish to pursue in more depth the influence of different soil types on vine performance and wine character. <br />Understanding Vineyard Soils will discuss new developments, especially in precision viticulture and organic viticulture. The introduction will address new technologies (near and remote sensing, digital soil mapping) as well as traditional soil classification. Following a chapter on site selection are the three core chapters on vineyard and soil management - The Nutrition of Grapevines, Where the Vine Roots Live, and The Living Soil. The book is written from an international perspective - the important points discussed in Chapters 1 through 6 are illustrated with examples drawn from many wine regions around the world.",3.69,160,Hardcover, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2614261-wine-soils-simplified,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2614261-wine-soils-simplified

Alone and untethered, feeling lost in the country he had come to regard as home, Hans stumbles upon the vibrant New York subculture of cricket, where he revisits his lost childhood and, thanks to a friendship with a charismatic and charming Trinidadian named Chuck Ramkissoon, begins to reconnect with his life and his adopted country. Ramkissoon, a Gatsby-like figure who is part idealist and part operator, introduces Hans to an “other” New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality. Hans is alternately seduced and instructed by Chuck’s particular brand of naivete and chutzpah--by his ability to hold fast to a sense of American and human possibility in which Hans has come to lose faith. <br /><br />Netherland gives us both a flawlessly drawn picture of a little-known New York and a story of much larger, and brilliantly achieved ambition: the grand strangeness and fading promise of 21st century America from an outsider’s vantage point, and the complicated relationship between the American dream and the particular dreamers. Most immediately, though, it is the story of one man--of a marriage foundering and recuperating in its mystery and ordinariness, of the shallows and depths of male friendship, of mourning and memory.

But while these workers, who leave their rural towns to find jobs in China's cities, are the driving force behind China's growing economy, little is known about their day-to-day lives or the sociological significance of this massive movement. In Factory Girls, Leslie T. Chang tells the story of these workers primarily through the lives of two young women whom she follows over the course of three years. Chang vividly portrays a world where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a cell phone; where lying about your age, your education, and your work experience is often a requisite for getting ahead; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class. Throughout this affecting portrait of migrant life, Chang also interweaves the story of her own family's migrations, within China and to the West, providing a historical frame of reference for her investigation. At a time when the Olympics will have shifted the world's focus to China, Factory Girls offers a previously untold story about the immense population of unknown women who work countless hours, often in hazardous conditions, to provide us with the material goods we take for granted. A book of global significance, it demonstrates how the movement from rural villages to cities is remaking individual lives and the fates of families, transforming our world much as immigration to America's shores remade our own society a century ago.",3.92,420,Hardcover, ,838,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2635587-factory-girls,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2635587-factory-girls

Helene grew up at Sugar Beach, a twenty-two-room mansion by the sea. Her childhood was filled with servants, flashy cars, a villa in Spain, and a farmhouse up-country. It was also an African childhood, filled with knock foot games and hot pepper soup, heartmen and neegee. When Helene was eight, the Coopers took in a foster child—a common custom among the Liberian elite. Eunice, a Bassa girl, suddenly became known as “Mrs. Cooper’s daughter.”<br /><br />For years the Cooper daughters—Helene, her sister Marlene, and Eunice—blissfully enjoyed the trappings of wealth and advantage. But Liberia was like an unwatched pot of water left boiling on the stove. And on April 12, 1980, a group of soldiers staged a coup d'état, assassinating President William Tolbert and executing his cabinet. The Coopers and the entire Congo class were now the hunted, being imprisoned, shot, tortured, and raped. After a brutal daylight attack by a ragtag crew of soldiers, Helene, Marlene, and their mother fled Sugar Beach, and then Liberia, for America. They left Eunice behind.<br /><br />A world away, Helene tried to assimilate as an American teenager. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill she found her passion in journalism, eventually becoming a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. She reported from every part of the globe—except Africa—as Liberia descended into war-torn, third-world hell.<br /><br />In 2003, a near-death experience in Iraq convinced Helene that Liberia—and Eunice—could wait no longer. At once a deeply personal memoir and an examination of a violent and stratified country, The House at Sugar Beach tells of tragedy, forgiveness, and transcendence with unflinching honesty and a survivor's gentle humor. And at its heart, it is a story of Helene Cooper’s long voyage home.",3.89,354,Hardcover, ,859,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2643182-the-house-at-sugar-beach,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2643182-the-house-at-sugar-beach

She's a simple peasant they call Queen of Heaven. She's the Lord's humble servant, yet an icon of female strength. She's mother of all, yet ever-virgin, lowly and exalted. Sinners fly to her but angels bow. Mary, mother of Jesus, is the most recog-nized woman in history . . . and the most misunderstood.<br /><br />Non-Christians paint her as an earth goddess.

Still others feel abandoned altogether by the supposedly pro-family and pro-mother social justice movement that is feminism and are at a loss when it comes to reconciling their maternal instincts with their political beliefs.<br /><br />With <i>Opting In</i>, Amy Richards addresses the anxiety over parenting that women face today in a book that mixes memoir, interviews, historical analysis, and feminist insight.

In <em>The Vietnam War</em>, Mark Atwood Lawrence draws upon the latest research in archives around the world to offer readers a superb account of a key moment in U.S. as well as global history.<br /><br />While focusing on American involvement between 1965 and 1975, Lawrence offers an unprecedentedly complete picture of all sides of the war, notably by examining the motives that drove the Vietnamese communists and their foreign allies. Moreover, the book carefully considers both the long- and short-term origins of the war. Lawrence examines the rise of Vietnamese communism in the early twentieth century and reveals how Cold War anxieties of the 1940s and 1950s set the United States on the road to intervention. Of course, the heart of the book covers the ""American war,"" ranging from the overthrow of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem to the impact of the Tet Offensive on American public opinion, Lyndon Johnson's withdrawal from the 1968 presidential race, Richard Nixon's expansion of the war into Cambodia and Laos, and the problematic peace agreement of 1973, which ended American military involvement. Finally, the book explores the complex aftermath of the war--its enduring legacy in American books, film, and political debate, as well as Vietnam's struggles with severe social and economic problems.<br /><br />A compact and authoritative primer on an intensely relevant topic, this well-researched and engaging volume offers an invaluable overview of the Vietnam War.<br />",3.95,214,Hardcover, ,27,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2701228-the-vietnam-war,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2701228-the-vietnam-war

A long-time resident, Meyer has, for the past two years, lived as no other Westerner—in a shared courtyard home in Beijing’s oldest neighborhood, Dazhalan, on one of its famed <i>hutong</i> (lanes). There he volunteers to teach English at the local grade school and immerses himself in the community, recording with affection the life stories of the Widow, who shares his courtyard; coteacher Miss Zhu and student Little Liu; and the migrants Recycler Wang and Soldier Liu; among the many others who, despite great differences in age and profession, make up the fabric of this unique neighborhood.<br /><br />Their bond is rapidly being torn, however, by forced evictions as century-old houses and ways of life are increasingly destroyed to make way for shopping malls, the capital’s first Wal-Mart, high-rise buildings, and widened streets for cars replacing bicycles. Beijing has gone through this cycle many times, as Meyer reveals, but never with the kind of dislocation and overturning of its storied culture now occurring as the city prepares to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.           <br /><br />Weaving historical vignettes of Beijing and China over a thousand years through his narrative, Meyer captures the city’s deep past as he illuminates its present.

Welcome to the world of Green Chic. Choosing to be green makes a real difference in the fight against global warming. But did you know that it's also hip, classic and stylish? <br />Offering up dozens of author-tested, earth-friendly ideas, writer Christie Matheson reveals that being chic and saving the planet aren't mutually exclusive. <br />Embrace the fabulousness of green living and you can: <br />- Look gorgeous <br />- Have a killer wardrobe<br />- Feel amazing<br />- Travel in style<br />- Create a home that's an oasis<br />- Host fun parties<br />- Eat incredible food and drink phenomenal wine<br />... All while feeling more connected to your friends, family and nature. <br />(And did we mention that green women don't get fat?) <br />Printed on recycled paper, with a portion of its proceeds going to a green cause, Green Chic is the perfect book for style-savvy readers with a green heart. Can living a chic green lifestyle TRULY make a difference to the planet? You bet your organic cotton sheets it can. <br />Buying into the Green Chic movement doesn't mean you need to buy more stuff.<br />Avoid products that purport to be green just for the marketing effect: ""organic"" processed foods; huge, gas-guzzling hybrid SUVs; clothes boasting that they're green just because they're made from ""natural"" cotton. Claiming to be green is trendy and companies out there are taking advantage.

Being ecofriendly means consuming less, not more. Get in the habit of thinking before you buy. The best time to purchase ecofriendly goods is when you need them.

Over time, and despite a demanding and dramatic life in London, she finds herself drawn to the self-contained Dawsey Adams, and to the story of Elizabeth, a young woman whose bright spirit and strength live on in the daughter she left behind when she was sent to a concentration camp.

For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose thoughtful companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. But with the unexpected return of Claude, Edgar's paternal uncle, turmoil consumes the Sawtelles' once peaceful home. When Edgar's father dies suddenly, Claude insinuates himself into the life of the farm—and into Edgar's mother's affections. <br /><br />Grief-stricken and bewildered, Edgar tries to prove Claude played a role in his father's death, but his plan backfires—spectacularly. Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who follow him. But his need to face his father's murderer and his devotion to the Sawtelle dogs turn Edgar ever homeward. <br /><br />David Wroblewski is a master storyteller, and his breathtaking scenes—the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain—create a riveting family saga, a brilliant exploration of the limits of language, and a compulsively readable modern classic.",3.62,566,Hardcover, ,12010,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2731276-the-story-of-edgar-sawtelle,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2731276-the-story-of-edgar-sawtelle

Almost 900 miles long, the range climbs to nearly 11,000 feet and boasts several canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon. The rules of law and society have never taken hold in the Sierra Madre, which is home to bandits, drug smugglers, Mormons, cave-dwelling Tarahumara Indians, opium farmers, cowboys, and other assorted outcasts. Outsiders are not welcome; drugs are the primary source of income; murder is all but a regional pastime. The Mexican army occasionally goes in to burn marijuana and opium crops—the modern treasure of the Sierra Madre—but otherwise the government stays away. In its stead are the drug lords, who have made it one of the biggest drug-producing areas in the world.<br /> <br />Fifteen years ago, journalist Richard Grant developed what he calls ""an unfortunate fascination"" with this lawless place. Locals warned that he would meet his death there, but he didn't believe them—until his last trip. During his travels Grant visited a folk healer for his insomnia and was prescribed rattlesnake pills, attended bizarre religious rituals, consorted with cocaine-snorting policemen, taught English to Guarijio Indians, and dug for buried treasure. On his last visit, his reckless adventure spiraled into his own personal heart of darkness when cocaine-fueled Mexican hillbillies hunted him through the woods all night, bent on killing him for sport.<br /> <br />With gorgeous detail, fascinating insight, and an undercurrent of dark humor, <i>God's Middle Finger</i> brings to vivid life a truly unique and uncharted world.",3.96,288,Paperback, ,294,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2736567-god-s-middle-finger,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2736567-god-s-middle-finger

A nudist, he was devoted to quirky folk dancing. In 1937, while working as a biochemist at Cambridge, he fell in love with a visiting Chinese student, with whom he began a lifelong affair. His mistress persuaded him to travel to her home country, where he embarked on a series of expeditions to the frontiers of the ancient empire. He searched for evidence to bolster a conviction that the Chinese were responsible for hundreds of humankind's most familiar innovations—including printing, the compass, explosives, suspension bridges, even toilet paper—often centuries before others. His journeys took him across war-torn China, consolidating his admiration for the Chinese. After the war, he determined to announce what he'd discovered &amp; began writing <em>Science &amp; Civilization in China</em>, describing the country's long history of invention &amp; technology.

The Twelve Detectives—a society of the twelve most famous, compelling, and dazzling detectives from around the world—have been asked to discuss the secrets of their trade as part of the fair's lineup of events. The Twelve travel to Paris to convene as a single body for the first time, but also, if some whispers are to be believed, to debate the very philosophy that underlies their pursuit of the world's most wanted criminals.<br /><br />But one detective is conspicuously absent: the legendary founding member of The Twelve, Renato Craig, will not attend. In his place he sends his novice assistant, Sigmundo Salvatrio—son of a shoemaker, a lifelong detective-arts devotee, and the only remaining student of Craig's famed Academy for Detectives in Buenos Aires. Salvatrio arrives in Paris, carrying a secret message meant only for Craig's best friend and cofounder of The Twelve, the brilliant, brooding, and fiercely competitive Viktor Arzaky.<br /><br />When a member of The Twelve is discovered dead at the foot of the gleaming Eiffel Tower, the first in what turns into a series of grisly murders, Arzaky and Salvatrio find themselves in a race against time around glorious fin de siècle Paris, encountering all manner of secret societies, solving philosophical puzzles, while also trying to save a dangerously beautiful woman.<br /><br />The pair soon realizes that the stakes involved are unimaginably high; they must not only catch the stalking murderer but also alter the fate of their precious brotherhood.<br /><br />Written in a strikingly original voice, and poignantly evoking a world about to lose its innocence forever, The Paris Enigma opens a window onto crime solving's early days, when wit, common sense, and intelligence were the only tools a detective could rely on.",3.30,256,Hardcover, ,81,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2766546-the-paris-enigma,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2766546-the-paris-enigma

  <br />
</b><i>“I and my companions suffer from a disease of the heart which can be cured only with gold.”</i> —<i>Hernán Cortés<br /><br /></i>It was a moment unique in human history, the face-to-face meeting between two men from civilizations a world apart. Only one would survive the encounter. In 1519, Hernán Cortés arrived on the shores of Mexico with a roughshod crew of adventurers and the intent to expand the Spanish empire. Along the way, this brash and roguish conquistador schemed to convert the native inhabitants to Catholicism and carry off a fortune in gold. That he saw nothing paradoxical in his intentions is one of the most remarkable—and tragic—aspects of this unforgettable story of conquest.<br /><br />In Tenochtitlán, the famed City of Dreams, Cortés met his Aztec counterpart, Montezuma: king, divinity, ruler of fifteen million people, and commander of the most powerful military machine in the Americas. Yet in less than two years, Cortés defeated the entire Aztec nation in one of the most astonishing military campaigns ever waged. Sometimes outnumbered in battle thousands-to-one, Cortés repeatedly beat seemingly impossible odds. Buddy Levy meticulously researches the mix of cunning, courage, brutality, superstition, and finally disease that enabled Cortés and his men to survive.<b><br /><br />Conquistador </b>is the story of a lost kingdom—a complex and sophisticated civilization where floating gardens, immense wealth, and reverence for art stood side by side with bloodstained temples and gruesome rites of human sacrifice. It’s the story of Montezuma—proud, spiritual, enigmatic, and doomed to misunderstand the stranger he thought a god.

Or that most crashes happen on sunny, dry days? That our minds can trick us into thinking the next lane is moving faster? Or that you can gauge a nation s driving behavior by its levels of corruption? These are only a few of the remarkable dynamics that Tom Vanderbilt explores in this fascinating tour through the mysteries of the road. <br />Based on exhaustive research and interviews with driving experts and traffic officials around the globe, <i>Traffic</i> gets under the hood of the everyday activity of driving to uncover the surprisingly complex web of physical, psychological, and technical factors that explain how traffic works, why we drive the way we do, and what our driving says about us. Vanderbilt examines the perceptual limits and cognitive underpinnings that make us worse drivers than we think we are. He demonstrates why plans to protect pedestrians from cars often lead to more accidents. He shows how roundabouts, which can feel dangerous and chaotic, actually make roads safer and reduce traffic in the bargain. He uncovers who is more likely to honk at whom, and why. He explains why traffic jams form, outlines the unintended consequences of our quest for safety, and even identifies the most common mistake drivers make in parking lots. <br />The car has long been a central part of American life; whether we see it as a symbol of freedom or a symptom of sprawl, we define ourselves by what and how we drive. As Vanderbilt shows, driving is a provocatively revealing prism for examining how our minds work and the ways in which we interact with one another. Ultimately, <i>Traffic</i> is about more than driving: it s about human nature. This book will change the way we see ourselves and the world around us. And who knows? It may even make us better drivers.""",3.71,402,Hardcover, ,1035,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2776527-traffic,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2776527-traffic

Profoundly dark, told in spare, searing prose, <i>The Road</i> is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece, one of the best books we've read this year, but in case you need a second (and expert) opinion, we asked Dennis Lehane, author of equally rich, occasionally bleak and brutal novels, to read it and give us his take. Read his glowing review below. --<i>Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p> 
  <strong>Guest Reviewer: Dennis Lehane</strong>
<br><br> <img src=""https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380920315i/3264294.jpg"" class=""gr-hostedUserImg""><b>Dennis Lehane, master of the hard-boiled thriller, generated a cult following with his series about private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, wowed readers with the intense and gut-wrenching <i>Mystic River</i>, blew fans away with the mind-bending <i>Shutter Island</i>, and switches gears with <i>Coronado</i>, his new collection of gritty short stories (and one play).</b><br><br> Cormac McCarthy sets his new novel, <i>The Road</i>, in a post-apocalyptic blight of gray skies that drizzle ash, a world in which all matter of wildlife is extinct, starvation is not only prevalent but nearly all-encompassing, and marauding bands of cannibals roam the environment with pieces of human flesh stuck between their teeth. If this sounds oppressive and dispiriting, it is. McCarthy may have just set to paper the definitive vision of the world after nuclear war, and in this recent age of relentless saber-rattling by the global powers, it's not much of a leap to feel his vision could be not far off the mark nor, sadly, right around the corner. Stealing across this horrific (and that's the only word for it) landscape are an unnamed man and his emaciated son, a boy probably around the age of ten. It is the love the father feels for his son, a love as deep and acute as his grief, that could surprise readers of McCarthy's previous work. McCarthy's Gnostic impressions of mankind have left very little place for love. In fact that greatest love affair in any of his novels, I would argue, occurs between the Billy Parham and the wolf in <i>The Crossing</i>. But here the love of a desperate father for his sickly son transcends all else. McCarthy has always written about the battle between light and darkness; the darkness usually comprises 99.9% of the world, while any illumination is the weak shaft thrown by a penlight running low on batteries. In <i>The Road</i>, those batteries are almost out--the entire world is, quite literally, dying--so the final affirmation of hope in the novel's closing pages is all the more shocking and maybe all the more enduring as the boy takes all of his father's (and McCarthy's) rage at the hopeless folly of man and lays it down, lifting up, in its place, the oddest of all things: faith. --<i>Dennis Lehane</i>  <div><br></div>",3.97,254,Hardcover,Large Print,34,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2798529-the-road,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2798529-the-road

But a tragic accident when she was seventeen shattered her identity and made her understand the fragility of life and the tenuousness of luck. So more than a decade later, when she meets boisterous, charismatic Charlie Blackwell, she hardly gives him a second look: She is serious and thoughtful, and he would rather crack a joke than offer a real insight; he is the wealthy son of a bastion family of the Republican party, and she is a school librarian and registered Democrat. Comfortable in her quiet and unassuming life, she feels inured to his charms. And then, much to her surprise, Alice falls for Charlie.<br /><br />As Alice learns to make her way amid the clannish energy and smug confidence of the Blackwell family, navigating the strange rituals of their country club and summer estate, she remains uneasy with her newfound good fortune. And when Charlie eventually becomes President, Alice is thrust into a position she did not seek–one of power and influence, privilege and responsibility. <br /><br />As Charlie’s tumultuous and controversial second term in the White House wears on, Alice must face contradictions years in the making: How can she both love and fundamentally disagree with her husband? How complicit has she been in the trajectory of her own life? What should she do when her private beliefs run against her public persona?<br /><br />In Alice Blackwell, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Curtis Sittenfeld has created her most dynamic and complex heroine yet. <i>American Wife</i> is a gorgeously written novel that weaves class, wealth, race, and the exigencies of fate into a brilliant tapestry–-a novel in which the unexpected becomes inevitable, and the pleasures and pain of intimacy and love are laid bare.",3.75,555,Hardcover, ,5764,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2807199-american-wife,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2807199-american-wife

<p>Now, after extended operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, new research from a similar group of scholars shows that many aspects of profession have been restored, especially in the field Army. But can the strategic leaders of the Army now capture and maintain that professionalism while simultaneously fighting a war and transforming the Army? On this question, the most informed perspectives available are contained in the seven parts of this 2d edition and they argue that the Army’s leaders must do so if they are to be successful in either endeavor. Organized around the profession’s expert knowledge, this text is designed for the development of military professionals at all levels, as well as for civilian courses in national security and military affairs.</p><p><b>The Future of the Army Profession</b> is listed in: The U.S. Army Chief of Staff’s Professional Reading List published by the U.S. Army Center for Military History, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" href=""http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg"">http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg</a></p>",3.43,792,Paperback,Revised and Expanded Second Edition,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2808384-the-future-of-the-army-profession,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2808384-the-future-of-the-army-profession

His previous publisher, Hoze Honari, refused the book for its explicit and critical comments on the war and the treatment of its veterans. Backyard was well received in Iranian literary circles, and was nominated for the Yalda, Ghalam Zarin and Golshiri literary awards in 2004.<br /><br />Synopsis<br />In the aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, veteran Ashour Mashali is crippled, shell shocked, and struggling to deal with his parent’s deaths. His beloved sister, Sharifeh, a nurse, cares for other veterans during the day and looks after Ashour at nights.<br />Together, they live on the grounds of the school they attended as children. When the landowner decides to tear down the school, Ashour decides to fight to preserve the place where his parents, as well as his childhood innocence, were both destroyed by war. Sharifeh, desperate to help him come to terms with the present, hits upon the idea of running a missing person ad for Ashour with the purpose of finding and reuniting their childhood circle of friends. Soon they are brought back together, rekindling old loves and sparking a new feeling of possibility in life. But time has changed them all, and Ashour is not the only one who has suffered.<br />Ashour was asleep when Sharifeh arrived. He was lying on his back on the metal bed, snoring through his half-open mouth. A bit of cotton clung to his unkempt beard, and it fluttered with every warm waft of his breath. Sharifeh bent over to remove the thread, and then she stepped back and looked at him. He looked like a man who'd been having nightmares. His bed sheet coiled around his waist, shoulders and limbs like a snake; his forehead and the dark curve of his cheeks were dotted with big beads of sweat. She turned the ceiling fan off. 'I hope he won’t catch cold,' she murmurs. She takes her headscarf off, runs her slim fingers through her hair, saying: 'Ah, God, I'm dying of the heat in here.' Her hair hung down to her waist. 'I should get it cut short; otherwise I'll stew in summer.' She puts her hair up in a loose bun on top of her head, hoping a breeze of wind touches the nape of her neck.<br />The fan blades slowed with small, interrupted chirps. Sharifeh went into the other room and took off her gown. She put on her flower Indian skirt and came back. Again, her glance stole to the metal bed and its new occupant. With his snake coiled around him, Ashour rolled a bit towards the wall. Above, the ceiling fan gave up the last of its momentum and stops. She takes a newspaper out of her olive green purse, and riffles through the pages with delicate haste. Just as she had at the kiosk earlier, she searches in it for the missing person's page. She'd had no chance to look through it on the minibus. The wind had crackled in one ear, while a talkative Mrs. Garmsiri took advantage of the other. Now she was afraid of waking Ashour, but was not in the mood to go to the other room or out into the garden. She started skimming the page again and found the entry she was looking for. Ashour’s picture was clear and sweet. Under the picture was the word 'Missing'; shouting for attention with its bold, black font. She read the attached text slowly: (the subject of the pictures, Eshour Mashali….)<br />Seeing the ad again, she felt a second wash of pity for the typist's illiteracy and blamed herself for not emphasizing Ashour’s name, for she had not said that Ashour is spelled with an ' A'; not an ' E'. She returned to the caption, ' … who has brain damage …'<br />The rigid springs of the bed squeaked, then Ashour’s voice called her away from the ad.<br />'When did you get back?' <br />She folded the newspaper and stuffed it back in her purse; 'A few minutes ago.'<br />They exchanged greetings when their eyes met. Ashour pulled himself into a sitting position with his right hand. With the left, he took his chafieh scarf from the bed frame and wiped the sweat off his face and neck.<br />'Damn, the power's gone out. I'm roasting in here from the heat,' he said.<br />'There is no outage. You were drenched in sweat, so I turned the fan off.' Sharifeh said.<br />'What about you? Aren’t you hot?' Ashour spoke with a low, hoarse voice.<br />Sharifeh said; ‘Not at all. Get up and have a shower to cool off.’<br />Sharifeh said, 'Get up then, before the water cuts off again.'<br />She knew very well that the shower, cooling off and the water cutting out were just excuses. She could not bear the weight of his eyes. He was there, while his missing person ads were everywhere. Her only choice was to control her mounting anxiety, so she left her purse by the wall. The room was in a mess. The cloth where she ate breakfast was still spread on the floor. She put the tea-steamer cups on the tray, collected the dried pieces of bread, and wiped the cloth with a sponge. Then, with a few brisk moves, she picked up the clothes that were scattered all over the room. But through it all she could feel the presence of Ashour, clinging to the metal bed and staring at her. 'Do not look into his eyes,' she thought, 'like a fortuneteller, he can read every thing from your eyes. 'She busied herself collecting shahed’s books and toys. A page in one of his notebooks caught her attention. He had drawn a dove, a white dove shining in a sky of red. She said, 'Look what my boy has drawn. It’s very nice, isn’t it? '<br />Ashour did not look. Maybe he had seen it before. Maybe he was more concerned with Sharifeh, with her manner, with her clear discomfort.<br />'What’s up? It seems like you are stressed out over something.'<br />Sharifeh looked at him in the full-length mirror on the closet door. This way was better, and in direct line, reflect gaze. 'I’m fine, just tired. I was very busy today.'<br />‘You are always busy, aren’t you?’<br />‘That’s why. When tiredness gradually builds up, all of a sudden it becomes too much.’<br />‘Today you seem more tired than ever. Have you had an argument or something with anybody?’<br />‘No, dear. I’m just tired. I need a week off.’<br />‘A week off? For what?’<br />‘For a break; for breathing in fresh air that doesn’t smell of alcohol and medicine, or bed sheets without disinfectant.’<br />Quickly she changed the subject.<br />‘You would like to have some lunch, wouldn’t you?’<br />‘I’m still stuffed from this morning’s meal. Only I feel so thirsty.’<br />‘Would you like me to bring some water for you?’<br />‘I’m bloated from drinking too much water. Make some tea, sister.’<br />Sharifeh plugged in the samovar, opened the lid and looked at the sediment inside. It was half full. She wished Ashour would get up and leave the room, so that she could read the missing person ad thoroughly and then hide the newspaper.<br />She knew if he did not peel himself off the black metal bed, he would sit there for hours and repeat the same bored, sarcastic words. Words she was not in the mood to hear. She took her fake pearl necklace off her slim neck and put it in the side cabinet. ‘I’ll get lunch ready and prepare the tea while you take a shower.’<br />‘You go ahead and eat; I have no appetite for lunch, Sharifeh.’<br />‘Then whet your appetite, Ashour. We have dhal for lunch. I’ll warm some up for you.’<br />‘Don’t worry about it.’<br />‘How can I not worry? Even the patients at our hospital look better than you do. You don’t eat right. Do you want to add an ulcer to your collection of sufferings?’<br />She stood up, got his crutches ready for him, and said, ‘Come on, give me a “Ya Ali!” ‘<br />Ashour looked up at her. ‘Now you’re giving orders?’<br />Sharifeh`s face filled with a soft smile. ‘This is not an order, sir! This is an imperative, a mandate for your continued existence. Hurry up! Otherwise, I will have you punished; sixty set-ups.’<br />Ashour said, ‘Not “set-ups”, idiot! Sit-ups.’<br />‘What’s the difference? Set-up sounds better. Say “Ya Ali!” ‘<br />She reached out to him. Ashour took her hand and slid himself forward. ‘You’ve become too cheeky. You might as well just get it over with; give me a good, clean finishing blow!’ He took hold of one of the crutches.<br />Her next breath was filled with Ashour’s scent. ‘A dead person does not need to be finished off, does he?’ she said. ‘And as long as you are lounging on this bed, you are dead.’ She held his arms. ‘Come on, get a move on. I’m starving.’<br />She loved Ashour’s smile. She would never give up on that smile. He took the other crutch and started walking before he asked, ‘Have you bought a newspaper?’<br />Sharifeh stood up, holding the tray. Her legs were shaking. The cups on the tray rattled. She went to the next room where both the kitchen and closet were. ‘No. did you want me to?’<br />‘You should have bought one.’<br />‘I’ll go out for one in the afternoon. Or maybe I’ll ask Shahed to. Now go take a shower before the water pressure cuts out.’<br />‘Okay, fine. I give in. it seems I’m stuck in hospital Number Two around here!’<br />The sound of his crutches striking the ground in her garden echoed through the house. She held her breathe and returned to the bedroom, where she turned on the fan. Grabbing her purse, she pulled out the newspaper. Quickly, she found the missing persons page with her shaking hands, and tore it free. Then she stuffed the remaining pages into her purse and put the purse under the bed. She went back to the next room with the page. Reading his caption, she once again felt sorry for the writer’s illiteracy. Ashour`s picture cried out for her praise. ‘How innocent you are, baby Ashour!’ her big eyes filled with tears, ‘with this face of yours which isn’t smiling, weeping, talking or silent.’<br />She pulled up the corner of the mattress and said, ‘Hide under there for now, until I can see what to do.’ She concealed the page under the bedcover, with its design of petunias and daisies. She folded her bare, sticky arms across her chest and grasped her elbows. Standing by the window, she stared at the schoolyard through a gap in the blue curtain. The sound of rain wet her ears. But it was not raining outside at all. It was dry. There was neither rain nor even the smallest cloud. There was just the blue sky, the sunshine, and a gentle northern breeze that set the flag dancing atop its mast. Below, Ashour was standing on his one leg, his lips murmuring something. The sparrows, which fled his clattering steps, flitted back to perch on the windowsill, right before Sharifeh’s eyes. She dropped the curtain. The sparrows flew from the window, seeking refuge in the heart of the weeping willow.<br />",3.58,351,Paperbook, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2811433,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2811433

In one of the first in-depth ethnographic accounts of refugee repatriation anywhere in the world, Laura C. Hammond follows the story of Ada Bai, a returnee settlement with a population of some 7,500 people. In the days when refugees first arrived, Ada Bai was an empty field along Ethiopia's northwest border, but it is now a viable--arguably thriving--community. For the former refugees who fled from northern Ethiopia to eastern Sudan to escape war and famine in 1984 and returned to their country of birth in 1993, ""coming home"" really meant creating a new home out of an empty space. Settling in a new area, establishing social and kin ties, and inventing social practices, returnees gradually invested their environment with meaning and began to consider their settlement home. Hammond outlines the roles that gender and generational differences played in this process and how the residents came to define the symbolic and geographical boundaries of Ada Bai. Drawing on her fieldwork from 1993 to 1995 and regular shorter periods since, Hammond describes the process by which a place is made meaningful through everyday practice and social interaction. <i>This Place Will Become Home</i> provides insight into how people cope with extreme economic hardship, food insecurity, and limited access to international humanitarian or development assistance in their struggle to attain economic self-sufficiency.",4.00,257,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2820745-this-place-will-become-home,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2820745-this-place-will-become-home

What was this great political enterprise all about? Who were these people who are considered the philosophical, spiritual, and moral ancestors of our nation? What Vowell discovers is something far different from what their uptight shoe-buckles-and-corn reputation might suggest. The people she finds are highly literate, deeply principled, and surprisingly feisty. Their story is filled with pamphlet feuds, witty courtroom dramas, and bloody vengeance. Along the way she asks:<br /><br />Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, Christlike Christian, or conformity's tyrannical enforcer? <i>Yes!</i> <br /><br />Was Rhode Island's architect Roger Williams America's founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? <i>Same difference</i>. <br /><br />What does it take to get that jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? <i>A hatchet</i>. <br /><br />What was the Puritans' pet name for the Pope? <i>The Great Whore of Babylon</i>. <br /><br />Sarah Vowell's special brand of armchair history makes the bizarre and esoteric fascinatingly relevant and fun.

Knopf,en-US,false,"<i>Young people starting out in television sometimes say to me: “I want to be you.” My stock reply is always: “Then you have to take the whole package.”</i><br /><br />And now, at last, the most important woman in the history of television journalism gives us that “whole package,” in her inspiring and riveting memoir. After more than forty years of interviewing heads of state, world leaders, movie stars, criminals, murderers, inspirational figures, and celebrities of all kinds, Barbara Walters has turned her gift for examination onto herself to reveal the forces that shaped her extraordinary life.<br /><br />Barbara Walters’s perception of the world was formed at a very early age. Her father, Lou Walters, was the owner and creative mind behind the legendary Latin Quarter nightclub, and it was his risk-taking lifestyle that gave Barbara her first taste of glamour. It also made her aware of the ups and downs, the insecurities, and even the tragedies that can occur when someone is willing to take great risks, for Lou Walters didn’t just make several fortunes—he also lost them. Barbara learned early about the damage that such an existence can do to relationships—between husband and wife as well as between parent and child. Through her roller-coaster ride of a childhood, Barbara had a close companion, her mentally challenged sister, Jackie. True, Jackie taught her younger sister much about patience and compassion, but Barbara also writes honestly about the resentment she often felt having a sister who was so “different” and the guilt that still haunts her.<br /><br />All of this—the financial responsibility for her family, the fear, the love—played a large part in the choices she made as she grew up: the friendships she developed, the relationships she had, the marriages she tried to make work. Ultimately, thanks to her drive, combined with a decent amount of luck, she began a career in television. And what a career it has been! Against great odds, Barbara has made it to the top of a male-dominated industry. She was the first woman cohost of the Today show, the first female network news coanchor, the host and producer of countless top-rated Specials, the star of 20/20, and the creator and cohost of The View. She has not just interviewed the world’s most fascinating figures, she has become a part of their world. These are just a few of the names that play a key role in Barbara’s life, career, and book: Yasir Arafat, Warren Beatty, Menachem Begin, George H. W. Bush, George W.

Published in 1884 by the English clergyman and headmaster Edwin A. Abbott, it is the fanciful tale of A. Square, a two-dimensional being who is whisked away by a mysterious visitor to The Land of Three Dimensions, an experience that forever alters his worldview—just as the book altered the worldview of its Victorian readers with the then-radical idea of a fourth dimension.<br /><br />Like Abbott's original text, Ian Stewart’s commentary takes readers on a strange and wonderful journey. With clarity and wit, Stewart illuminates Abbott’s numerous Victorian references, weaves in biographical information about Abbott and his intellectual circle, which included the novelist H.G. Wells and the mathematician George Boole, and traces the scientific evolution of geometric forms and dimensions.<br /><br />Touching on such diverse topics as ancient Babylon, Karl Marx, Frankenstein, Mt. Everest, and phrenology. Stewart makes fascinating connections between <i>Flatland</i> and Edwin Abbott’s life and times.

In books like <i>Rebecca</i>, <i>My Cousin Rachel</i>, and <i>Jamaica Inn </i>she transformed the small dramas of everyday life—love, grief, jealousy—into the stuff of nightmares. Less known, though no less powerful, are her short stories, in which she gave free rein to her imagination in narratives of unflagging suspense.<br />Patrick McGrath's revelatory new selection of du Maurier's stories shows her at her most chilling and most psychologically astute: a dead child reappears in the alleyways of Venice; routine eye surgery reveals the beast within to a meek housewife; nature revolts against man's abuse by turning a benign species into an annihilating force; a dalliance with a beautiful stranger offers something more dangerous than a broken heart. McGrath draws on the whole of du Maurier's long career and includes surprising discoveries together with famous stories like ""The Birds"". <i>Don't Look Now</i> is a perfect introduction to a peerless storyteller.",4.09,346,Paperback,NYRB Classics ,181,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2871390-don-t-look-now,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2871390-don-t-look-now

Clare Mann, the daughter of a Protestant working-class family from Ohio, has never met anyone like her new roommate, Sally Rose. Wealthy, pretty, and Jewish, barely emancipated from her close-knit Los Angeles family, Sally has led a sheltered life. Still, she and the hard-working, jaded Clare form an extraordinary friendship that endures for years, through disastrous marriages, motherhood, and demanding careers on opposite coasts. Clare is fascinated by Sally's calm probity, her family's seeming perfection, the utter confidence and willful naivete that rule her personal life, while sheer ruthlessness governs her law practice. She comes to need Sally the way she has never needed anyone, and her trips to California provide respite from her own family difficulties and her growing responsibilities as a doctor specializing in AIDS.<br /><br />But as Clare grows closer to the Roses over the years, especially to Sally's father, she stumbles upon a carefully guarded family secret that could alienate her from Sally forever. And when the death of Ben, Sally's heroin-addicted younger brother, follows soon after the death of their mother, Clare is stunned to see this once-enviable and larger-than-life family reduced to human proportions.<br /><br />In this impressive debut, Martha Moody is pitch-perfect in her depiction of the subtle shifts of emotion and perspective that occur as people-and friendships-mature.

Or at least Jean has. But Locke is slowly succumbing to a deadly poison that no alchemist or physiker can cure. Yet just as the end is near, a mysterious Bondsmage offers Locke an opportunity that will either save him or finish him off once and for all.<br /><br />Magi political elections are imminent, and the factions are in need of a pawn. If Locke agrees to play the role, sorcery will be used to purge the venom from his body - though the process will be so excruciating he may well wish for death. Locke is opposed, but two factors cause his will to crumble: Jean's imploring - and the Bondsmage's mention of a woman from Locke's past: Sabetha. She is the love of his life, his equal in skill and wit, and now, his greatest rival. <br /><br />Locke was smitten with Sabetha from his first glimpse of her as a young fellow orphan and thief-in-training. But after a tumultuous courtship, Sabetha broke away. Now they will reunite in yet another clash of wills. For faced with his one and only match in both love and trickery, Locke must choose whether to fight Sabetha - or to woo her.

The girl’s deceased family has been branded as heretical, and no one in Egypt will speak their names.

They provided a radically new way of looking at the physical world and explanations for many questions unanswered by classical physics. Unfortunately, many laypeople consider relativity so abstruse and complicated that they despair of ever understanding it. In reality, the ideas, although profound, are quite simple.<br />That simplicity is strikingly illuminated in this delightfully nontechnical book, which explains relativity in a straightforward, carefully illustrated manner the intelligent layperson can understand. A little high-school geometry will enable the reader to follow the discussion. Moreover, the book includes more than 60 drawings to illustrate concepts more clearly than verbal explanations could ever do.<br />Beginning with the questions ""What is Time?"" and ""What is Space?"" the author gradually introduces concepts from ordinary geometry needed to follow the development of Einstein's ideas. Having grasped this foundation, the reader is prepared to understand the specific nature and ramifications of relativity theory. To further increase comprehension, the book is planned so that the text and illustrations face each other on a two-page spread, making it easy for the reader to refer from the text to the illustrations.<br />Clear, engrossing and well-balanced, this remarkably accessible treatment offers an ideal introduction to one of the most important physical theories of the 20th century. It can be read with profit by high-school and college students, teachers, scientists, or any reader fascinated by Einstein's epoch-making theories and their far-reaching implications.",3.81,128,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2916363-relativity-in-illustrations,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2916363-relativity-in-illustrations

In May 2002, Tillman walked away from his $3.6 million NFL contract to enlist in the United States Army. He was deeply troubled by 9/11, and he felt a strong moral obligation to join the fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Two years later, he died on a desolate hillside in southeastern Afghanistan.<br /><br />Though obvious to most of the two dozen soldiers on the scene that a ranger in Tillman’s own platoon had fired the fatal shots, the Army aggressively maneuvered to keep this information from Tillman’s wife, other family members, and the American public for five weeks following his death. During this time, President Bush repeatedly invoked Tillman’s name to promote his administration’s foreign policy. Long after Tillman’s nationally televised memorial service, the Army grudgingly notified his closest relatives that he had “probably” been killed by friendly fire while it continued to dissemble about the details of his death and who was responsible.<br /><br />In <i>Where Men Win Glory</i>, Jon Krakauer draws on Tillman’s journals and letters, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and extensive research on the ground in Afghanistan to render an intricate mosaic of this driven, complex, and uncommonly compelling figure as well as the definitive account of the events and actions that led to his death. Before he enlisted in the army, Tillman was familiar to sports aficionados as an undersized, overachieving Arizona Cardinals safety whose virtuosity in the defensive backfield was spellbinding. With his shoulder-length hair, outspoken views, and boundless intellectual curiosity, Tillman was considered a maverick. America was fascinated when he traded the bright lights and riches of the NFL for boot camp and a buzz cut. Sent first to Iraq—a war he would openly declare was “illegal as hell”—and eventually to Afghanistan, Tillman was driven by complicated, emotionally charged, sometimes contradictory notions of duty, honor, justice, patriotism, and masculine pride, and he was determined to serve his entire three-year commitment. But on April 22, 2004, his life would end in a barrage of bullets fired by his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />Krakauer chronicles Tillman’s riveting, tragic odyssey in engrossing detail highlighting his remarkable character and personality while closely examining the murky, heartbreaking circumstances of his death. Infused with the power and authenticity readers have come to expect from Krakauer’s storytelling, <i>Where Men Win Glory </i>exposes shattering truths about men and war.<br /><i>From the inside cover of ISBN 0385522266 / 9780385522267</i>",4.03,383,Hardcover, ,2646,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2936415-where-men-win-glory,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2936415-where-men-win-glory

Founded in 1995, Pitchfork has developed one of the web's most devoted followings, with more than 1.6 million readers monthly who tune in for daily reviews, news, features, videos, and interviews. <br /> <br /> In <i>The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present,</i> Pitchfork offers up their take on the 500 best songs of the past three decades. Focusing on indie rock (Arcade Fire, the Shins), hiphop (Public Enemy, Jay-Z), electronic (Daft Punk, Boards of Canada), pop (Madonna, Justin Timberlake), metal (Metallica, Boris), and experimental underground music (Suicide, Boredoms), it features all-new essays and reviews written with the sharp wit and insight for which the site is known. <br /> <br /> Kicking it off in 1977 with the birth of punk and independent music, <i>The Pitchfork 500</i> runs chronologically, with each chapter representing a distinct period and offering a narrative of how the musical landscape of the day influenced its artists. The book opens with David Bowie, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Kraftwerk, and Brian Eno, the ""art-rock godfathers"" who set the tone and tenor for the next thirty years, and wraps up in the present, when bands connect with new audiences through social networking sites and prime-time TV placements -- and when a single mp3 can turn a niche indie artist into a global sensation. Sidebars like ""Yacht Rock,"" ""Runaway Trainwrecks,"" ""Nanofads,"" and ""Career Killers"" call out some far-from-classic musical trends and identify the guiltiest offenders. <br /> <br /> Modernizing the music-guide format, <i>The Pitchfork 500</i> reflects the way listeners are increasingly processing music -- by song rather than by album.

Until then she will continue behaving as everyone expects her to behave: a mediocre pre-teen high on adolescent subculture, a good but not an outstanding student, an obedient if obstinate daughter. <br /><br />Paloma and Renée hide both their true talents and their finest qualities from a world they suspect cannot or will not appreciate them. They discover their kindred souls when a wealthy Japanese man named Ozu arrives in the building. Only he is able to gain Paloma's trust and to see through Renée's timeworn disguise to the secret that haunts her. This is a moving, funny, triumphant novel that exalts the quiet victories of the inconspicuous among us.",3.77,325,Paperback, ,14801,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2967752-the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2967752-the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog

To support his case, he reviews a wealth of research from storytellers, teachers, and others who have experienced the power of story firsthand.<br /><br /><br /><br />The author has collected anecdotal experiences from over 100 performing storytellers and from 1,800 story practitioners (mostly teachers) who have made extensive use of stories.

The death of the eleventh Imam, with no apparent successor, resulted in internal conflicts, many desertions and conversions, and the emergence of numerous splinter groups and subsects within the Imâmite community. Contemporary Imâmite theologians had the difficult task of defending the doctrine against attack while trying to offer new interpretations of fundamental principles to accommodate contemporary developments. Abu Jafar b. Qiba al-Razi, one of the most prominent and active Imâmite theologians, had a major role in all of these reconstructions and developments. The present work attempts to shed light on some aspects of the Imâmite doctrine during the Minor Occultation and on the contributions of Abu Jafar b. Qiba to the formation of the developed Imâmite doctrine.

There was Michael Chabon's The Final Solution in which ""the old man,"" an 89-year-old beekeeper in Sussex is undoubtedly Holmes. Laurie King, a fine mystery writer, has appropriated Holmes and created a romance between him and young Mary Russell which has lasted through several enjoyable books. And now, nonagenarian Holmes reappears, most appealingly, in Mitch Cullin's A Slight Trick of the Mind. He is frail and forgetful but still observant and capable of shining the bright light of his insight and brilliance on events both past and present.<br /><br />Cullin has carefully woven three stories together and managed it so neatly that no threads show--worthy of Holmes himself. The first is the story of Holmes's recent return from a trip to Japan, ostensibly in search of prickly ash, a bush that he believes contributes to healthy longevity, as does his beloved and trusted royal jelly. While there, he is met by his correspondent, Mr. Umezaki, who isn't as interested in prickly ash as in gleaning information from Holmes about his long-gone father. Supposedly, they met many years before, in London, and Holmes advised him not to return home. Of course, Holmes has no recollection of the meeting but finesses it nicely.<br /><br />It is 1947 when they visit Hiroshima, post-atomic bomb, and Holmes marvels at what he sees. He compares it, most poignantly, to the loss of the queen in a hive, ""when no resources were available to raise a new one. Yet how could he explain the deeper illness of unexpressed desolation, that imprecise pall harbored en masse by ordinary Japanese?"" That is what he tells Roger, the 14-year-old son of his housekeeper. Roger is the second thread of the novel. Holmes is introducing him to beekeeping and Roger proves an apt student. His hero-worship of Holmes and his need for a father form an integral part of Cullin's intention of ""humanizing"" the great Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />The final thread is revealed in a journal that Holmes kept, in which he entered an encounter with a married woman, many years ago. He is infatuated with her, and hardly knows what to call it or what to make of his feelings. This is unfamiliar territory for the man who is rational above all else. The man we know at the end of the book makes the reader want another installment, showing a new Sherlock with a heart as well as a brain.<br /><br />(Amazon Review)",3.48,0,Unknown Binding, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2974823-a-slight-trick-of-the-mind,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2974823-a-slight-trick-of-the-mind

Dr Lentz demonstrates, through a careful examination of particular texts, the great improbability that a Jew of strict Pharisaic background would have held, let alone been proud of, Roman citizenship and citizenship of the city of Tarsus. By investigating the social and legal expectations of the first century, the author shows that Paul is seen to be deferred to in matters of legal minutiae by those in positions of authority.

It is 1952, and new apartheid laws have recently gone into effect, dividing a nation into black and white while supposedly healing the political rifts between the Afrikaners and the English. Tensions simmer as the fault line between the oppressed and the oppressors cuts deeper, but it's not until an Afrikaner police officer is found dead that emotions more dangerous than anyone thought possible boil to the surface.<br /><br />When Detective Emmanuel Cooper, an Englishman, begins investigating the murder, his mission is preempted by the powerful police Security Branch, who are dedicated to their campaign to flush out black communist radicals. But Detective Cooper isn't interested in political expediency and has never been one for making friends. He may be modest, but he radiates intelligence and certainly won't be getting on his knees before those in power. Instead, he strikes out on his own, following a trail of clues that lead him to uncover a shocking forbidden love and the imperfect life of Captain Pretorius, a man whose relationships with the black and coloured residents of the town he ruled were more complicated and more human than anyone could have imagined.<br /><br />The first in her Detective Emmanuel Cooper series, ""A Beautiful Place to Die"" marks the debut of a talented writer who reads like a brilliant combination of Raymond Chandler and Graham Greene. It is a tale of murder, passion, corruption, and the corrosive double standard that defined an apartheid nation.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole--a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.<br /><br />Considered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.<br /><br />When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:<br /><br /><br />Syntax<br />Objects<br />Functions<br />Inheritance<br />Arrays<br />Regular expressions<br />Methods<br />Style<br />Beautiful features<br />The real beauty?

This is the funny, poignant story of their two decades together.<br /><br />On Valentine's Day 1985, biologist Stacey O'Brien first met a four-day-old baby barn owl -- a fateful encounter that would turn into an astonishing 19-year saga. With nerve damage in one wing, the owlet's ability to fly was forever compromised, and he had no hope of surviving on his own in the wild. O'Brien, a young assistant in the owl laboratory at Caltech, was immediately smitten, promising to care for the helpless owlet and give him a permanent home. Wesley the Owl is the funny, poignant story of their dramatic two decades together. <br /><br />With both a tender heart and a scientist's eye, O'Brien studied Wesley's strange habits intensively and first-hand -- and provided a mice-only diet that required her to buy the rodents in bulk (28,000 over the owl's lifetime). As Wesley grew, she snapped photos of him at every stage like any proud parent, recording his life from a helpless ball of fuzz to a playful, clumsy adolescent to a gorgeous, gold-and-white, macho adult owl with a heart-shaped face and an outsize personality that belied his 18-inch stature. Stacey and Wesley's bond deepened as she discovered Wesley's individual personality, subtle emotions, and playful nature that could also turn fiercely loyal and protective -- though she could have done without Wesley's driving away her would-be human suitors! <br /><br />O'Brien also brings us inside the prestigious research community, a kind of scientific Hogwarts where resident owls sometimes flew freely from office to office and eccentric, brilliant scientists were extraordinarily committed to studying and helping animals; all of them were changed by the animal they loved. As O'Brien gets close to Wesley, she makes important discoveries about owl behavior, intelligence, and communication, coining the term ""The Way of the Owl"" to describe his inclinations: he did not tolerate lies, held her to her promises, and provided unconditional love, though he was not beyond an occasional sulk. When O'Brien develops her own life-threatening illness, the biologist who saved the life of a helpless baby bird is herself rescued from death by the insistent love and courage of this wild animal. <br /><br />Enhanced by wonderful photos, Wesley the Owl is a thoroughly engaging, heartwarming, often funny story of a complex, emotional, non-human being capable of reason, play, and, most important, love and loyalty. It is sure to be cherished by animal lovers everywhere.",4.12,230,Hardcover, ,1448,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3001512-wesley-the-owl,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3001512-wesley-the-owl

In <i>The World Is What It Is,</i> Patrick French offers the first authoritative biography of the controversial Nobel laureate, whose only stated ambition was greatness as a writer, in pursuit of which goal nothing else was sacred.<br /><br />Beginning with a richly detailed portrait of Naipaul's childhood in colonial Trinidad, French gives us the boy born to an Indian family, the displaced soul in a displaced community, who by dint of talent and ambition finds the only imaginable way out: a scholarship to Oxford. London in the 1950s offers hope and his first literary success, but homesickness and depression almost defeat Vidia, his narrow escape aided by Patricia Hale, an Englishwoman who will devote herself to his work and well-being. She will stand by him, sometimes tenuously, for more than four decades, even as Naipaul embarks on a twenty-four-year affair, which will awaken half-dead passions and feed perhaps his greatest wave of dizzying creativity. Amid this harrowing emotional life, French traces the course of the fierce visionary impulse underlying Naipaul's singular power, a gift to produce masterpieces of fiction and nonfiction.<br /><br />Informed by exclusive access to V. S. Naipaul's private papers and personal recollections, and by great feeling for his formidable body of work, French's revelatory biography does full justice to an enigmatic genius.",4.13,554,Hardcover, ,73,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3006513-the-world-is-what-it-is,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3006513-the-world-is-what-it-is

Falsely fingered a war criminal, Bernie Gunther has booked passage to Buenos Aires, lured, like the Nazis whose company he has always despised, by promises of a new life and a clean passport from the Perón government. But Bernie doesn't have the luxury of settling into his new home and lying low. He is soon pressured by the local police into taking on a case in which a girl has turned up dead, gruesomely mutilated, and another--the daughter of a wealthy German banker--has gone missing. Both crimes seem to connect to an unsolved case Bernie worked on back in Berlin in 1932. It's not so far-fetched that the cases might be linked: after all, the scum of the earth has been washing up on Argentine shores--state-licensed murderers and torturers--so why couldn't a serial killer be among them?<br /><br />But Argentina, just like Germany, holds terrible secrets within its corrupt halls of power. When beautiful Anna Yagubsky seeks Gunther out, desperate for help, to find out what happened to her Jewish aunt and uncle who have disappeared, he is drawn into a horror story that rivals everything he has tried so hard to leave behind half a world away.<br /><br />In this new postwar world, Bernie Gunther is a man without a name or a country, but still in full possession of his conscience.

She uncovers the nature of this success by retelling unofficial histories of Trident, of production roads not taken, and of potential technological distractions. The production of Trident, she shows, was not inevitable but contingent and problematic.<br /><br />Using material from interviews and local texts, Mort explores the emergence of a counternetwork in the form of a workers' campaign for alternative technologies. She develops concepts of disenrollment and absent intermediaries, in which redundant workers and marginalized technologies serve to discipline and reinforce the dominant network as production shrinks. She also examines the maintenance of the barrier between the technical and the social/political in this context. The management of uncertainties within the Trident production program emerges as critical to its successful completion.",3.00,232,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3057462-building-the-trident-network,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3057462-building-the-trident-network

Instead, he brings it back to the base for someone to claim, but when no one does, he finds himself always carrying the photo in his pocket. Soon Thibault experiences a sudden streak of luck—winning poker games and even surviving deadly combat that kills two of his closest buddies. Only his best friend, Victor, seems to have an explanation for his good fortune: the photograph—his lucky charm.<br />Back home in Colorado, Thibault can’t seem to get the photo—and the woman in it—out of his mind.

Caught off guard by the attraction he feels, Thibault keeps the story of the photo, and his luck, a secret. As he and Elizabeth embark upon a passionate and all-consuming love affair, the secret he is keeping will soon threaten to tear them apart—destroying not only their love, but also their lives.<br />Filled with tender romance and terrific suspense, The Lucky One is Nicholas Sparks at his best—an unforgettable story about the surprising paths our lives often take and the power of fate to guide us to true and everlasting love.",4.12,326,Hardcover, ,8726,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063499-the-lucky-one,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063499-the-lucky-one

Seventy-two-year-old August Brill is recovering from a car accident in his daughter's house in Vermont. When sleep refuses to come, he lies in bed and tells himself stories, struggling to push back thoughts about things he would prefer to forget--his wife's recent death and the horrific murder of his granddaughter's boyfriend, Titus. The retired book critic imagines a parallel world in which America is not at war with Iraq but with itself. In this other America the twin towers did not fall and the 2000 election results led to secession, as state after state pulled away from the union and a bloody civil war ensued. As the night progresses, Brill's story grows increasingly intense, and what he is so desperately trying to avoid insists on being told. Joined in the early hours by his granddaughter, he gradually opens up to her and recounts the story of his marriage. After she falls asleep, he at last finds the courage to revisit the trauma of Titus's death. Passionate and shocking, Man in the Dark is a novel of our moment, a book that forces us to confront the blackness of night even as it celebrates the existence of ordinary joys in a world capable of the most grotesque violence. *Time Out (Chicago)",3.60,180,Hardcover, ,119,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3078560-man-in-the-dark,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3078560-man-in-the-dark

Clem, the archetypal youngest, is the rebel: uncontainable, iconoclastic, committed to her work but not to the men who fall for her daring nature.

But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage.

But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues. </p><p>While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house.

But when she tried going back to her apartment in Seattle and returning to graduate school, she knew it wasn't possible to resume life as though nothing had happened. So she went to Paris, a city that held vivid memories of a childhood trip with her father, of early morning walks on the cobbled streets of the Latin Quarter and the taste of her first pain au chocolat. She was supposed to be doing research for her dissertation, but more often, she found herself peering through the windows of chocolate shops, trekking across town to try a new pâtisserie, or tasting cheeses at outdoor markets, until one evening when she sat in the Luxembourg Gardens reading cookbooks until it was too dark to see, she realized that her heart was not in her studies but in the kitchen.<br /><br />At first, it wasn't clear where this epiphany might lead. Like her long letters home describing the details of every meal and market, Molly's blog Orangette started out merely as a pleasant pastime. But it wasn't long before her writing and recipes developed an international following. Every week, devoted readers logged on to find out what Molly was cooking, eating, reading, and thinking, and it seemed she had finally found her passion. But the story wasn't over: one reader in particular, a curly-haired, food-loving composer from New York, found himself enchanted by the redhead in Seattle, and their email correspondence blossomed into a long-distance romance.<br /><br />In <i>A Homemade Life: Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table</i>, Molly Wizenberg recounts a life with the kitchen at its center.

Even the oddities—the entire state of Maryland(!)—have become so engrained that our map might as well be a giant jigsaw puzzle designed by Divine Providence. But that's where the real mystery begins. Every edge of the familiar wooden jigsaw pieces of our childhood represents a revealing moment of history and of, well, humans drawing lines in the sand.<br /><br /><em>How the States Got Their Shapes</em> is the first book to tackle why our state lines are where they are.

From ancient times to the present, scientists and philosophers have marveled at how such a seemingly abstract discipline could so perfectly explain the natural world. More than that—mathematics has often made predictions, for example, about subatomic particles or cosmic phenomena that were unknown at the time, but later were proven to be true. Is mathematics ultimately invented or discovered? If, as Einstein insisted, mathematics is “a product of human thought that is independent of experience,” how can it so accurately describe and even predict the world around us? <br /><br />Physicist and author Mario Livio brilliantly explores mathematical ideas from Pythagoras to the present day as he shows us how intriguing questions and ingenious answers have led to ever deeper insights into our world.

The Virtues of Ignorance: Complexity, Sustainability, and the Limits of Knowledge proposes an alternative to this hubristic, shortsighted, and dangerous worldview. The contributors argue that uncritical faith in scientific knowledge has created many of the problems now threatening the planet and that our wholesale reliance on scientific progress is both untenable and myopic. Bill Vitek, Wes Jackson, and a diverse group of thinkers, including Wendell Berry, Anna Peterson, and Robert Root-Bernstein, offer profound arguments for the advantages of an ignorance-based worldview. Their essays explore this philosophy from numerous perspectives, including its origins, its essence, and how its implementation can preserve vital natural resources for posterity. All conclude that we must simply accept the proposition that our ignorance far exceeds our knowledge and always will. Rejecting the belief that science and technology are benignly at the service of society, the authors argue that recognizing ignorance might be the only path to reliable knowledge. They also uncover an interesting paradox: knowledge and insight accumulate fastest in the minds of those who hold an ignorance-based worldview, for by examining the alternatives to a technology-based culture, they expand their imaginations. Demonstrating that knowledge-based worldviews are more dangerous than useful, The Virtues of Ignorance looks closely at the relationship between the land and the future generations who will depend on it. The authors argue that we can never improve upon nature but that we can, by putting this new perspective to work in our professional and personal lives, live sustainably on Earth.",3.94,354,Hardcover, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3124387-the-virtues-of-ignorance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3124387-the-virtues-of-ignorance

Some are darkly fantastical and unsettling, such as the unraveling of a serial-killer murder mystery, or her accounts of an infatuated plastic surgeon and his sanitarium, and a mother back from the dead with dubious healing powers. Others are more attuned to surprising discoveries that shape personal identity, as in the story of a tragic past that lies within a family’s theme hotel, or that of a struggling musician who hopes an upcoming gig will be his big break. In “Jamilti,” Modan addresses political violence with a suicide bombing that shakes up a day in the lives of a young couple.</div>

When sleep refuses to come, he lies in bed and tells himself stories, struggling to push back thoughts about things he would prefer to forget—his wife’s recent death and the horrific murder of his granddaughter’s boyfriend, Titus. The retired book critic imagines a parallel world in which America is not at war with Iraq but with itself. In this other America the twin towers did not fall and the 2000 election results led to secession, as state after state pulled away from the union and a bloody civil war ensued.

Raised in Cesenatico, a quiet fishing town on the northern Adriatic Sea, she’d eventually have her own cooking schools in New York, Bologna, and Venice. There she would teach students from around the world to appreciate—and produce—the food that native Italians eat. She’d write bestselling and award-winning cookbooks, collect invitations to cook at top restaurants, and have thousands of loyal students and readers—some so devoted they’d name their daughters Marcella. Her fans will be as surprised and delighted by how this all came to be as Marcella herself has been.<br /><br /> Marcella begins with her early childhood in Alexandria, Egypt, where she broke her arm. After nearly losing the arm to poor medical treatment, she was taken back to her father’s native Italy for surgery. There the family would remain. Her teenage years coincided with World War II, and the family relocated temporarily to Lake Garda— not anticipating that it would be one of the war’s greatest targets. After years of privation and bombings, Marcella was fulfilling her ambition to become a doctor and professor of science when she met Victor, the love of her life. They married and moved to New York City. Marcella knew not a word of English or—what’s more surprising—a single recipe. She began to attempt to re-create the flavors of her homeland. She took a Chinese cooking class in the early ’60s with women who asked her to teach them Italian cooking, and she began to give them lessons. Soon after, Craig Claiborne invited himself to lunch, and the rest is history.<br /><br /> <i>Amarcord</i> means “I remember” in Marcella’s native Romagnolo dialect. In these pages Marcella, now eighty-four, looks back on the adventures of a life lived for pleasure and a love of teaching. Throughout, she entertains the reader with stories of the humorous, sometimes bizarre twists and turns that brought her love, fame, and a chance to change the way we eat forever.",3.51,320,Hardcover, ,64,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3138185-amarcord,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3138185-amarcord

Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.<br /><br />One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.<br /><br />Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.",3.81,483,Hardcover,First edition,1554,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3147367-american-lion,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3147367-american-lion

With chapters like ""No. We do not have any 'hot stock tips' for you,"" ""Mergers are a girl's best friend,"" and ""Georgetown I wouldn't let my maids' kids go there,"" the book captures the true <i>essence</i> of being in high finance. DIFGTBAB thematically walks through Wall Street culture, pointing out its intricacies: the bushleagueness of a Men's Warehouse suit or squared-toe shoes, the power of 80s pop, and the importance of Microsoft Excel shortcut keys as related to ever being able to have any significant global impact. The book features various, vivid illustrations of Bankers in their natural state (ballin'), and, in true Book 2.0 fashion, numerous, insightful comments from actual readers of the widely popular website LeveragedSellOut.com. Thorough and well-executed, it's lens into the heart of an often misunderstood, unfairly stereotyped subset of our society.

Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission. <br /><br />As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire. <br /><br />Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves. <br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children. Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.",3.96, ,Audio CD, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3149092-the-thirteenth-tale,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3149092-the-thirteenth-tale
