James M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, started it all back in the early 1890's and Sherlockian parody has been coming out regularly ever since, right into the age of the internet. <br />While Sherlock's creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lived, close to 400 appeared in Britain and America. In these early parodies, Sherlock is off on the wrong track in the great Coleslaw mystery, struggling with the disappearance of the President's Whisker, rescuing that damsel in distress, Elsa Lohengrin, and even delving into the spirit world---and much more.<br />Mark Twain, the Mr. Dooley of Finley Peter Dunne, Kenneth Grahame's Ratty of The Wind in the Willows, John Kendrick Bangs, Bret Harte, Ring Lardner, C. K. Chesterton, and O. Henry all contributed to this early Bedside collection. Sherlock turns up at Wellseley College and Yale, Hades and The Garden of Eden, Peoria and the Oklahoma Territory, in the trenches of War I and often in his familiar Baker Street hangout.<br />Sherlockian Charles Press began collecting these early lampoons as a hobby after retiring from Michigan State University. He is the author of two Sherlockian monographs, Parodies and Pastiches, Buzzing Round Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Looking Over Sir Arthur's Shoulder, and ""When Did Arthur Conan Doyle Meet Jean Leckie?"" in The Baker Street Journal.",4.50,356,Paperback, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21947925-a-bedside-book-of-early-sherlockian-parodies-and-pastiches,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21947925-a-bedside-book-of-early-sherlockian-parodies-and-pastiches

Así como la sociedad disciplinaria foucaultiana producía criminales y locos, la sociedad que ha acuñado el eslogan Yes We Can produce individuos agotados, fracasados y depresivos. Según el autor, la resistencia solo es posible en relación con la coacción externa. La explotación a la que uno mismo se somete es mucho peor que la externa, ya que se ayuda del sentimiento de libertad. Esta forma de explotación resulta, asimismo, mucho más eficiente y productiva debido a que el individuo decide voluntariamente explotarse a sí mismo hasta la extenuación. Hoy en día carecemos de un tirano o de un rey al que oponernos diciendo No. En este sentido, obras como Indignaos, de Stéphane Hessel, no son de gran ayuda, ya que el propio sistema hace desaparecer aquello a lo que uno podría enfrentarse. Resulta muy difícil rebelarse cuando víctima y verdugo, explotador y explotado, son la misma persona. Han señala que la filosofía debería relajarse y convertirse en un juego productivo, lo que daría lugar a resultados completamente nuevos, que los occidentales deberíamos abandonar conceptos como originalidad, genialidad y creación de la nada y buscar una mayor flexibilidad en el pensamiento: “todos nosotros deberíamos jugar más y trabajar menos, entonces produciríamos más”. ¿O es acaso una coincidencia que los chinos, para quienes originalidad y genialidad son conceptos desconocidos, sean los responsables de casi toda invención –desde la pasta hasta los fuegos artificiales- que ha dejado huella en Occidente? Sin embargo, esto no deja de ser para el autor una utopía inalcanzable para una sociedad en la que todos, incluso el ejecutivo mejor pagado, trabajamos como esclavos aplazando indefinidamente el ocio.",3.95,80,Kindle Edition, ,97,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21954673-la-sociedad-del-cansancio,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21954673-la-sociedad-del-cansancio

As the chief operating officer of Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign, Henry F. De Sio, Jr., was positioned to view this historic campaign as few others could. In this fascinating behind-the-scenes account, he whisks readers into Obama’s national election headquarters in Chicago to glimpse the decision-making processes and myriad details critical to running a successful and innovative presidential campaign. From the campaign’s early chaos to the jubilation and drama of winning the Iowa caucus, to the drawn-out Democratic nomination process, to Obama’s eventual election as president of the United States, De Sio guides readers through the challenges faced by the Obama for America campaign in its brief twenty-one-month lifespan.<br /><br /> De Sio shows readers that Obama himself was direct about his vision for the campaign when he instructed his staff to “run it like a business.” Thus, this is less the story of Barack Obama, candidate, and more the story of Barack Obama, CEO. Because campaigns are launched from scratch during every election cycle, they are the ultimate entrepreneurial experience. In the course of the election, the Obama campaign scaled up from a scrappy start-up to a nearly $1 billion operation, becoming a hothouse environment on which the glare of the media spotlight was permanently trained.<br /><br /><i>Campaign Inc.</i> allows readers to peek behind the curtain at the underdog organization that brought down the Clinton campaign and later went on to defeat the Republican machine, while offering lessons in leadership and organization to innovators, executives, and entrepreneurs.<br />",4.20,224,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21975753-campaign-inc,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21975753-campaign-inc

In <b><i>Zero to One</i></b>, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. <br /><br />Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.<br /><br />Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine.

Twenty years later, they gather around a campfire on the lawn of a New England mansion.

Archie—working-class, ordinary, a failed marriage under his belt—is calling it quits, the deciding factor being the flip of a 20-pence coin. When the owner of a nearby halal butcher shop (annoyed that Archie's car is blocking his delivery area) comes out and bangs on the window, he gives Archie another chance at life and sets in motion this richly imagined, uproariously funny novel. <br /><br />Epic and intimate, hilarious and poignant, White Teeth is the story of two North London families—one headed by Archie, the other by Archie's best friend, a Muslim Bengali named Samad Iqbal. Pals since they served together in World War II, Archie and Samad are a decidedly unlikely pair. Plodding Archie is typical in every way until he marries Clara, a beautiful, toothless Jamaican woman half his age, and the couple have a daughter named Irie (the Jamaican word for ""no problem""). Samad —devoutly Muslim, hopelessly ""foreign""— weds the feisty and always suspicious Alsana in a prearranged union. They have twin sons named Millat and Magid, one a pot-smoking punk-cum-militant Muslim and the other an insufferable science nerd. The riotous and tortured histories of the Joneses and the Iqbals are fundamentally intertwined, capturing an empire's worth of cultural identity, history, and hope.<br /><br />Zadie Smith's dazzling first novel plays out its bounding, vibrant course in a Jamaican hair salon in North London, an Indian restaurant in Leicester Square, an Irish poolroom turned immigrant café, a liberal public school, a sleek science institute. A winning debut in every respect, White Teeth marks the arrival of a wondrously talented writer who takes on the big themes —faith, race, gender, history, and culture— and triumphs.",3.78,448,Paperback, ,126,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22050068-white-teeth,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22050068-white-teeth

A obra conta as peripécias de Ardalión Boríssytch Peredónov, um professor do ginásio de uma pequena província russa do fim do século XIX, que busca uma esposa para alcançar o sonhado posto de inspetor. Numa série de intrigas e confusões, alimentadas por seus incorrigíveis circunvizinhos, o maldoso Peredónov passa a ser assaltado por estranhas alucinações, como a nedotykomka, que culminam num inexorável processo de loucura. Num enredo paralelo, mas que se mistura às diversas tramas e intrigas, temos o caso de amor da alegre Ludmila e o belo ginasiano Sacha, que conhece com ela as marcas ambíguas dos seus primeiros desejos. Peredónov, expressão máxima de uma sociedade mesquinha e decaída, tornou-se personagem tão marcante na sua época que seu nome passou a ser usado para caracterizar certos comportamentos egoístas e insensíveis, algo como Oblómov, do homônimo romance de Gontcharóv. As situações de O Diabo Mesquinho, escrito por Sologub durante dez anos (1892-1902), beiram o nonsense e tocam, ao mesmo tempo, em questões cheias de concretude e violência, relacionadas ao poder, à autoridade, ao funcionalismo público etc., sempre permeadas por flechadas irônicas, pessimistas e destituídas de psicologismos. A escrita pessimista de Fiódor Sologub, influenciada tanto pela narrativa de Cervantes (D.Quixote era seu livro de cabeceira) e pelo idealismo de Schopenhauer como pelo riso de Gógol e pelas questões de moralidade de Dostoiévski, mostra-nos um mundo no qual não há mais espaço para os ideais de perfeição, amor e beleza.",4.03,384,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22062531-o-diabo-mesquinho,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22062531-o-diabo-mesquinho

We read every chapter, summarize and analyze it for your convenience. <br /> <br />This is an InstaRead Summary of The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz. <br /> <br />Below is a preview of the earlier sections of the summary: <br /> <br />Introduction <br /> <br />Ben explains that every time he reads a self-help or management book, he thinks about the fact that it didn’t really address the hard things like laying people off or having good people start demanding unreasonable things. The problem with self-help books is that they try to provide a recipe for dealing with difficult, dynamic situations. Challenging situations can not be solved with a formula. Instead of using a formula in this book, the author presents his story as he progressed from an entrepreneur to CEO to venture capitalist. He shares some of the lessons he has learned along the way. He explains that although circumstances may differ, patterns and lessons resonate with each experience. For the last several years, he has shared lessons learned on his popular blog. Many people have emailed him to ask about the stories behind the lessons. Ben shares that he has been inspired along the way by many family members, friends, and advisers who have helped him. Hip-hop/rap music has also inspired him because these artists aspire to be both great and successful. He also admires that rappers see themselves as entrepreneurs.   <br /> <br />1: From Communist to Venture Capitalist <br /> <br />Ben’s grandparents were card-carrying Communists. His dad grew up indoctrinated in the Communist philosophy. Ben’s family moved to Berkeley, California, in 1968. His dad then became the editor of the famous New Left magazine, Ramparts. When Ben was five, his family moved to Bonita Avenue, a middle-class Berkeley neighborhood. One day, a friend of Ben’s older brother, Roger, pointed to an African American kid down the block who happened to be riding in a red wagon. Roger dared Ben to go tell the kid to give him his wagon, and if he refused,to spit in his face and call him a racial epithet. Roger wasn’t a racist and did not come from a bad family. Ben later found out that he had schizophrenia. He had wanted to see a fight. Ben was afraid of Roger, and his demand put him in a very tough situation. He thought Roger would beat him up if he didn’t do what he told him to do.  He was also afraid to ask for the wagon. He walked toward the boy and when he got near enough, he said, “Can I ride in your wagon?” The boy, Joel Clark Jr., said, “Sure.” Ben turned to look at Roger and saw that he was gone. Ben went on to play with Joel all day, and they have been best friends ever since. That experience taught Ben that being scared didn’t mean he was gutless. He learned that what he did mattered and determined whether he would be a hero or a coward. If he had completely followed Roger’s order, he would have never met his best friend. He also learned not to judge things by appearance alone.

Anthony, and Lucretia Mott. ""Historically,"" the inscription beneath the marble statue notes, ""these three stand unique and peerless."" In fact, the statue has a glaring omission: Lucy Stone. A pivotal leader in the fight for both abolition and gender equality, her achievements marked the beginning of the women's rights movement and helped to lay the groundwork for the eventual winning of women's suffrage. Yet, today most Americans have never heard of Lucy Stone.<br /><br />Sally McMillen sets out to address this significant historical oversight in this engaging biography. Exploring her extraordinary life and the role she played in crafting a more just society, McMillen restores Lucy Stone to her rightful place at the center of the nineteenth-century women's rights movement. Raised in a middle-class Massachusetts farm family, Stone became convinced at an early age that education was key to women's independence and selfhood, and went on to attend the Oberlin Collegiate Institute. When she graduated in 1847 as one of the first women in the US to earn a college degree, she was drawn into the public sector as an activist and quickly became one of the most famous orators of her day. Lecturing on anti-slavery and women's rights, she was instrumental in organizing and speaking at several annual national woman's rights conventions throughout the 1850s. She played a critical role in the organization and leadership of the American Equal Rights Association during the Civil War, and, in 1869, cofounded the American Woman Suffrage Association, one of two national women's rights organizations that fought for women's right to vote. Encompassing Stone's marriage to Henry Blackwell and the birth of their daughter Alice, as well as her significant friendships with Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, and others, McMillen's biography paints a complete picture of Stone's influential and eminently important life and work.<br /><br />Self-effacing until the end of her life, Stone did not relish the limelight the way Elizabeth Cady Stanton did, nor did she gain the many followers whom Susan B. Anthony attracted through her extensive travels and years of dedicated work. Yet her contributions to the woman's rights movement were no less significant or revolutionary than those of her more widely lauded peers. In this accessible, readable, and historically-grounded work, Lucy Stone is finally given the standing she deserves.<br />",4.21,360,Hardcover, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22104324-lucy-stone,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22104324-lucy-stone

District doctor Garin is desperately trying to reach the village of Dolgoye, where a mysterious epidemic called the “Chernukha” is raging and threatens to spread throughout the country, turning people into zombies. The doctor carries with him a vaccine that will prevent the spread of this terrible disease, but is stymied in his travels by an all-consuming snow storm, an impenetrable blizzard that turns a drive that should last only a few hours into a voyage of days, and finally, a journey into eternity.<br /><br /><i>The Blizzard </i>dramatizes a timeless metaphysical predicament. The characters in this nearly post-apocalyptic world are constantly in motion, and yet somehow trapped and frozen—spending day and night fighting their way through the storm on an expedition filled with extraordinary encounters, dangerous escapades, torturous imaginings, and amorous adventures. In the fantastical realm Sorokin has invented, the reader also loses her bearings, subject to the vicissitudes of time and change, to both the movement of life and its stagnancy. Hypnotic, fascinating, and richly descriptive, <i>The Blizzard</i> is a seminal work from one of the most inventive writers working today. ",3.64,192,Hardcover, ,130,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237141-the-blizzard,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237141-the-blizzard

It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality―the black Chinese restaurant.<br /><br />Born in the ""agrarian ghetto"" of Dickens―on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles―the narrator of The Sellout resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: ""I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since '68 quake."" Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.<br /><br />Fueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident―the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins―he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court.",3.76,289,Hardcover, ,5190,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237161-the-sellout,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237161-the-sellout

His buildings such as the Paimio Sanatorium (1933), the legendary Villa Mairea (1939) and the church of the Three Crosses in Vuoksenniska (1958), embody a masterful interplay of organic volumes, forms and materials. From door handles and lighting fixtures to built-in furniture, Aalto frequently designed complete interiors down to the smallest detail. With his plywood chairs, the master builder additionally became one of the most significant designers of the twentieth century. His Savoy Vase represents the quintessential qualities of Finnish and organic design. This richly illustrated book is the first in many years to offer a comprehensive and current overview of Aalto's oeuvre as an architect, designer and urban planner. Ten authors, including the renowned architectural historians Eeva-Liisa Pelkonen and Akos Moravanszky, and MoMA curator Pedro Gadanho, address central aspects of Aalto's work. Particular attention is paid to Aalto's dialogue with important artists of his day, including Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Jean Arp, Alexander Calder and Fernand Léger, as well as his interest in film, cinema and photography, whose influences on his work are examined here for the first time.

Pero la Primera Guerra Mundial estalla y los separa. Paul, que quiere escaparse como sea del infierno de las trincheras, se hace desertor y se reúne con Louise en París. Se encuentra a salvo, pero se ve obligado a esconderse en una habitación de hotel. Para poder salir de ese modo de vida clandestina, a Paul se le ocurre una solución: cambiar de identidad. A partir de ahora se llamará Suzanne. En 1925, sin embargo, llega la amnistía para los desertores y todo puede volver a su cauce normal. Suzanne puede volver a ser Paul. Una… ¿buena noticia?<br /><br />La extraordinaria vida de Paul Grappe y su mujer Louise Landy fue contada y documentada en el ensayo de los historiadores franceses Virgili y Voldman, La garçonne et l’assassin. Chloé Cruchaudet se basa en esta obra para dar vida a unos personajes con un destino increíble que buscan su lugar entre confusión de sexos y traumas, perversión y violencia.<br /><br />La emotiva novela gráfica coincide con el aniversario de un acontecimiento tan importante como desgarrador que es la Primera Guerra Mundial y se publica en una sociedad en pleno debate sobre la libertad de decidir y actuar sobre su cuerpo y/o según su identidad sexual. La autora consigue el tono justo, sin maniqueísmo y con mucha delicadeza, ayudada por su trazo ligero librado del marco clásico de las viñetas. La composición es tan viva como sus personajes, que cobran personalidad con la tinta china y los pocos colores (rojo o morado) que salpican las páginas.<br /><br />Los horrores de la guerra, la sensualidad de la pareja, la angustia de sus personajes o la libertad del Bois, todo aflora en la historia real pero increíble que nos cuenta Chloé Cruchaudet.",3.95,160,Hardcover,Emociónate,22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22283948-degenerado,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22283948-degenerado

Dead bluebottles were scattered on his hair and shoulders. I shined the flashlight on his white face and his black suit.""</i><br />This is Michael's introduction to Skellig, the man-owl-angel who lies motionless behind the tea chests in the abandoned garage in back of the boy's dilapidated new house. As disturbing as this discovery is, it is the least of Michael's worries. The new house is a mess, his parents are distracted, and his brand-new baby sister is seriously ill. Still, he can't get this mysterious creature out of his mind--even as he wonders if he has really seen him at all. What unfolds is a powerful, cosmic, dreamlike tale reminiscent of Madeleine L'Engle's <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>. British novelist David Almond works magic as he examines the large issues of death, life, friendship, love, and the breathtaking connections between all things.<p> Amidst the intensity and anxiety of his world, Michael is a normal kid. He goes to school, plays soccer, and has friends with nicknames like Leakey and Coot. It's at home where his life becomes extraordinary, with the help of Skellig and Mina, the quirky, strong-willed girl next door with ""the kind of eyes you think can see right through you."" Mina and her mother's motto is William Blake's ""How can a bird that is born for joy / Sit in a cage and sing?"" This question carries us through the book, as we see Michael's baby sister trapped in a hospital incubator; as we see the exquisite, winged Skellig crumpled in the garage; as we meet Mina's precious blackbird chicks and the tawny owls in her secret attic; and as we finally see a braver, bolder Michael spread his wings and fly. <i>Skellig</i> was the Whitbread Award's 1998 Children's Book of the Year, and this haunting novel is sure to resonate with readers young and old.

Knopf,eng,false,"For much of his adult life, Saul Bellow was the most acclaimed novelist in America, the winner of, among other awards, the Nobel Prize in Literature, three National Book Awards, and the Pulitzer Prize. <i>The Life of Saul Bellow</i>, by the literary scholar and biographer Zachary Leader, marks the centenary of Bellow's birth as well as the tenth anniversary of his death. It draws on unprecedented access to Bellow's papers, including much previously restricted material, as well as interviews with more than 150 of the novelist's relatives, close friends, colleagues, and lovers, a number of whom have never spoken to researchers before. Through detailed exploration of Bellow's writings, and the private history that informed them, Leader chronicles a singular life in letters, offering original and nuanced accounts not only of the novelist's development and rise to eminence, but of his many identities--as writer, polemicist, husband, father, Chicagoan, Jew, American.<br /><br /><br /><br />The biography will be published in two volumes. The first volume, <i>To Fame and Fortune: 1915-1964</i>, traces Bellow's Russian roots; his birth and early childhood in Quebec; his years in Chicago; his travels in Mexico, Europe, and Israel; the first three of his five marriages; and the novels from <i>Dangling Man</i> and <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> to the best-selling <i>Herzog. </i>New light is shed on Bellow's fellow writers, including Ralph Ellison, John Berryman, Lionel Trilling, and Philip Roth, and on his turbulent and influential life away from the desk, which was as full of incident as his fiction. Bellow emerges as a compelling character, and Leader's powerful accounts of his writings, published and unpublished, forward the case for his being, as the critic James Wood puts it, ""the greatest of American prose stylists in the twentieth century."" <br />",4.24,812,Hardcover, ,9,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318350-the-life-of-saul-bellow,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318350-the-life-of-saul-bellow

By the time of her death, in 2002, it was being practiced everywhere, from Brooklyn to Berlin to Ulaanbaatar. In <i>The Goddess Pose,</i> <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Michelle Goldberg traces the life of the incredible woman who brought yoga to the West—and in so doing paints a sweeping picture of the twentieth century.<br /><br /> Born into the minor aristocracy (as Eugenia Peterson), Devi grew up in the midst of one of the most turbulent times in human history. Forced to flee the Russian Revolution as a teenager, she joined a famous Berlin cabaret troupe, dove into the vibrant prewar spiritualist movement, and, at a time when it was nearly unthinkable for a young European woman to travel alone, followed the charismatic Theosophical leader Jiddu Krishnamurti to India. <br /><br /> Once on the subcontinent, she performed in Indian silent cinema and hobnobbed with the leaders of the independence movement. But her greatest coup was convincing a recalcitrant master yogi to train her in the secrets of his art. <br /><br /> Devi would go on to share what she learned with people around the world, teaching in Shanghai during World War II, then in Hollywood, where her students included Gloria Swanson and Greta Garbo. She ran a yoga school in Mexico during the height of the counterculture, served as spiritual adviser to the colonel who tried to overthrow Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, and, in her eighties, moved to Buenos Aires at the invitation of a besotted rock star. <br /> Everywhere she went, Indra Devi evangelized for yoga, ushering in a global craze that continues unabated.

Although the young woman has dreams of becoming a screenwriter, the only job Julie's able to find is one in the studio publicity office of the notoriously demanding producer David O. Selznick —who is busy burning through directors, writers and money as he begins filming <i>Gone with the Wind</i>.     <br /><br />Although tensions run high on the set, Julie finds she can step onto the back lot, take in the smell of smoky gunpowder and the soft rustle of hoop skirts, and feel the magical world of <i>Gone with the Wind</i> come to life. Julie's access to real-life magic comes when Carole Lombard hires her as an assistant and invites her into the glamorous world Carole shares with Clark Gable—who is about to move into movie history as the dashing Rhett Butler. <br /><br />Carole Lombard, happily profane and uninhibited, makes no secret of her relationship with Gable, which poses something of a problem for the studio as Gable is technically still married—and the last thing the film needs is more negative publicity. Julie is there to fend off the overly curious reporters, hoping to prevent details about the affair from slipping out. But she can barely keep up with her blonde employer, let alone control what comes out of Carole's mouth, and--as their friendship grows - soon finds she doesn't want to. Carole, both wise and funny, becomes Julie's model for breaking free of the past.<br />     <br /><br />In the ever-widening scope of this story, Julie is given a front-row seat to not one but two of the greatest love affairs of all time: the undeniable on-screen chemistry between Scarlett and Rhett, and off screen, the deepening love between Carole and Clark.

It was founded in a bizarre but momentous ""Land Run"" in 1889, when thousands of people lined up along the borders of Oklahoma Territory and rushed in at noon to stake their claims. Since then, it has been a city torn between the wild energy that drives its outsized ambitions, and the forces of order that seek sustainable progress. Nowhere was this dynamic better realized than in the drama of the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team's 2012-13 season, when the Thunder's brilliant general manager, Sam Presti, ignited a firestorm by trading future superstar James Harden just days before the first game. Presti's all-in gamble on ""the Process""—the patient, methodical management style that dictated the trade as the team’s best hope for long-term greatness—kicked off a pivotal year in the city's history, one that would include pitched battles over urban planning, a series of cataclysmic tornadoes, and the frenzied hope that an NBA championship might finally deliver the glory of which the city had always dreamed.<br /><br />Boom Town announces the arrival of an exciting literary voice. Sam Anderson, former book critic for <i>New York</i> magazine and now a staff writer at the <i>New York Times</i> magazine, unfolds an idiosyncratic mix of American history, sports reporting, urban studies, gonzo memoir, and much more to tell the strange but compelling story of an American city whose unique mix of geography and history make it a fascinating microcosm of the democratic experiment. Filled with characters ranging from NBA superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook; to Flaming Lips oddball frontman Wayne Coyne; to legendary Great Plains meteorologist Gary England; to Stanley Draper, Oklahoma City's would-be Robert Moses; to civil rights activist Clara Luper; to the citizens and public servants who survived the notorious 1995 bombing of the Alfred P.

Emerence is a peasant, illiterate, impassive, abrupt, seemingly ageless. She lives alone in a house that no one else may enter, not even her closest relatives.

The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn’t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.<br /><br />Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he’s released from prison after thirty-five years.<br /><br />Not since <i>Misery</i> has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. <i>Finders Keepers</i> is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life—for good, for bad, forever.",4.04,448,ebook, ,4591,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22453035-finders-keepers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22453035-finders-keepers

Now he offers his analysis of the twenty first century’s ultimate challenge: how to build a shared international order in a world of divergent historic perspectives, violent conflict, proliferating technology, and ideological extremism.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> There has never been a true “world order,” Kissinger observes. For most of history, civilizations defined their own concepts of order. Each considered itself the center of the world, and envisioned its distinct principles as universally relevant. China conceived of a global cultural hierarchy with the Emperor at its pinnacle. In Europe, Rome imagined itself surrounded by barbarians; when Rome fragmented, European peoples refined a concept of an equilibrium of sovereign states and sought to export it across the world. Islam considered itself the world’s sole legitimate political unit, destined to expand indefinitely until the world was brought into harmony by Muslim principles. The United States was born of a conviction about the universal applicability of democratic principles—a conviction that has guided its policies ever since.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Now international affairs take place on a global basis, and these historic concepts of world order are meeting. Every region participates in questions of high policy in every other, often instantaneously. Yet there is no consensus among the major actors about the rules and limits guiding this process, or its ultimate destination. The result is mounting tension.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Grounded in Kissinger’s deep study of history and experience as national security advisor and secretary of state, <i>World Order</i> guides readers on a tour of the globe. It examines the events and ideas that formed the historic concepts of order, their manifestations in contemporary controversies, and the ways in which they might ultimately be reconciled.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Provocative and articulate, blending historical insight with prognostication, <i>World Order</i> is a unique work that could only come from a lifelong diplomat. <br />",4.06, ,Kindle Edition, ,22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456847-world-order,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456847-world-order

Abby and Red and their four grown children have accumulated not only tender moments, laughter, and celebrations, but also jealousies, disappointments, and carefully guarded secrets. from Red's father and mother, newly-arrived in Baltimore in the 1920s, to Abby and Red's grandchildren carrying the family legacy boisterously into the twenty-first century, here are four generations of Whitshanks, their lives unfolding in and around the sprawling, lovingly worn Baltimore house that has always been their anchor.<br /><br />Brimming with all the insight, humour, and generosity of spirit that are the hallmarks of Anne Tyler's work, <i>A Spool of Blue Thread</i> tells a poignant yet unsentimental story in praise of family in all its emotional complexity.

Communities where heroin had never been seen before—from Charlotte, NC and Huntington, WVA, to Salt Lake City and Portland, OR—were overrun with it. Local police and residents were stunned. How could heroin, long considered a drug found only in the dense, urban environments along the East Coast, and trafficked into the United States by enormous Colombian drug cartels, be so incredibly ubiquitous in the American heartland? Who was bringing it here, and perhaps more importantly, why were so many townspeople suddenly eager for the comparatively cheap high it offered?<br /><br />With the same dramatic drive of <i>El Narco</i> and <i>Methland</i>, Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of American capitalism: The stories of young men in Mexico, independent of the drug cartels, in search of their own American Dream via the fast and enormous profits of trafficking cheap black-tar heroin to America’s rural and suburban addicts; and that of Purdue Pharma in Stamford, Connecticut, determined to corner the market on pain with its new and expensive miracle drug, Oxycontin; extremely addictive in its own right. Quinones illuminates just how these two stories fit together as cause and effect: hooked on costly Oxycontin, American addicts were lured to much cheaper black tar heroin and its powerful and dangerous long-lasting high. Embroiled alongside the suppliers and buyers are DEA agents, local, small-town sheriffs, and the US attorney from eastern Virginia whose case against Purdue Pharma and Oxycontin made him an enemy of the Bush-era Justice Department, ultimately stalling and destroying his career in public service.<br /><br /><i>Dreamland</i> is a scathing and incendiary account of drug culture and addiction spreading to every part of the American landscape.",4.24,384,Hardcover, ,2315,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22529381-dreamland,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22529381-dreamland

Changes in self-perception and hallucinations-those are some of my other symptoms. <i>You are poison</i>, I chanted silently to myself. <i>And your poison is contagious</i>.""<br />So begins Mac McClelland's powerful, unforgettable memoir, <i>Irritable Hearts</i>.<br /><br />When thirty-year-old, award-winning human rights journalist Mac McClelland left Haiti after reporting on the devastating earthquake of 2010, she never imagined how the assignment would irrevocably affect her own life. Back home in California, McClelland cannot stop reliving vivid scenes of violence. She is plagued by waking terrors, violent fantasies, and crippling emotional breakdowns. She can't sleep or stop crying. Her life in shambles, it becomes clear that she is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Her bewilderment about this sudden loss of control is magnified by the intensity of her feelings for Nico, a French soldier she met in Port-au-Prince and with whom she connected instantly and deeply.<br /><br />With inspiring fearlessness, McClelland tackles perhaps her most harrowing assignment to date: investigating the damage in her own mind and repairing her broken psyche. She begins to probe the depths of her illness, exploring our culture's history with PTSD, delving into the latest research by the country's top scientists and therapists, and spending time with veterans and their families. McClelland discovers she is far from alone: while we frequently associate PTSD with wartime combat, it is more often caused by other manner of trauma and can even be contagious-close proximity to those afflicted can trigger its symptoms. As she confronts the realities of her diagnosis, she opens up to the love that seems to have found her at an inopportune moment.<br /><br /><i>Irritable Hearts</i> is a searing, personal medical mystery that unfolds at a breakneck pace. But it is also a romance. McClelland fights desperately to repair her heart so that she can give it to the kind, patient, and compassionate man with whom she wants to share a life. Vivid, suspenseful, tender, and intimate, <i>Irritable Hearts</i> is a remarkable exploration of vulnerability and resilience, control and acceptance. It is a riveting and hopeful story of survival, strength, and love.",3.82,320,Hardcover, ,125,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22537675-irritable-hearts,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22537675-irritable-hearts

Why is it, for example, that some men believe, against all reason, that vandals stole their penises, even though they're in good physical shape? In <i>The Geography of Madness</i>, acclaimed magazine writer Frank Bures travels around the world to trace culture-bound syndromes to their sources—and in the process, tells a remarkable story about the strange things all of us believe.<br /><br /><br />Book Club Discussion Questions: <br /><br />For the paperback edition, a list of book club discussion questions is also being issued. If you’d like to add the The Geography of Madness to your group’s reading list, here are several conversation starters:<br /><br />1) One main themes of The Geography of Madness is that stories (about the world, about our lives, about our bodies) are contagious. Can you think of a story, or an experience, that changed what you believed was possible?<br /><br />2) Do you believe the brain and the mind are the same thing? If not, what is the difference? <br /><br />3) The stories in The Geography of Madness raise the question of free will: How much do you choose the life you live? How much do you learn (or catch) you life choices from those around you? <br /><br />4) Have you ever found yourself immersed in a situation where you did not know the rules? What was that like?<br /><br />5) In The Geography of Madness, the author argues that our mindset and our expectations have biological consequences. Does that resemble your experience? If so, how?<br /><br />6) Try to imagine living in a world where it was possible to have your genitals stolen, either by magic or by ghosts. How would you protect yourself?<br /><br />7) In The Geography of Madness, the author argues that a strong sense of self—of your story— can help to activate your endogenous (internal) healing systems and vice versa. Do you remember a time when a stressful or difficult period seemed to be followed by a health problem or sickness? <br /><br />8) In The Geography of Madness, did anyone’s genital actually disappear? If not, what happened? Does it matter?<br /><br />9) Is there a belief that everyone around you holds, but that you don’t share? How did you come to doubt this?<br /><br />10) The Handbook of Depression points to a genetic marker associated with greater vulnerability to depression. Yet this link only holds true in Western cultures. Why would that be?<br /><br />11) Have you ever had a health problem you were afraid to talk about, or that others didn’t believe in?<br /><br />12) In The Geography of Madness, the author argues that cultural syndromes are “real” syndromes, but that their causes might not lie where we think they do. Do you think they are “real” or “imaginary”? <br /><br />13) Over the last few years, gluten intolerance has been rising. This rise occurs at a time of increasing anxiety about the relationship between food, health and identity. What’s changed: our bodies or our culture?<br /><br />14) After reading The Geography of Madness, how would you describe what culture is?<br /><br />15) How much does a your culture create you?

The passengers were anxious. Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone, and for months, its U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era's great transatlantic ""Greyhounds"" and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. He knew, moreover, that his ship - the fastest then in service - could outrun any threat. <br /><br />Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger's U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small - hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. <br /><br />It is a story that many of us think we know but don't, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour, mystery, and real-life suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope Riddle to President Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.

So where is it? Well, for reasons this book makes crystal clear, that pill will never exist—but as a result of the research that’s gone into it, scientists in the last few years have learned more about how women’s sexuality works than we ever thought possible, and <i>Come as You Are</i> explains it all.<br /><br />The first lesson in this essential, transformative book by Dr. Emily Nagoski is that every woman has her own unique sexuality, like a fingerprint, and that women vary more than men in our anatomy, our sexual response mechanisms, and the way our bodies respond to the sexual world. So we never need to judge ourselves based on others’ experiences. Because women vary, and that’s normal.<br /><br />Second lesson: sex happens in a context. And all the complications of everyday life influence the context surrounding a woman’s arousal, desire, and orgasm. <br /><br />Cutting-edge research across multiple disciplines tells us that the most important factor for women in creating and sustaining a fulfilling sex life, is not what you do in bed or how you do it, but <i>how you feel about it</i>. Which means that stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman’s sexual wellbeing; they are central to it. Once you understand these factors, and how to influence them, you can create for yourself better sex and more profound pleasure than you ever thought possible.<br /><br />And Emily Nagoski can prove it.",4.28,400,Paperback, ,1981,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609341-come-as-you-are,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609341-come-as-you-are

But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.<br /><br />Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?<br /><br />David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly American story of Wilbur and Orville Wright.<br /><br />Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing, but there were books aplenty, supplied mainly by their preacher father, and they never stopped reading.<br /><br />When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education, little money and no contacts in high places, never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances, they risked being killed.<br /><br />In this thrilling book, master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them.",4.13,320,Hardcover, ,5436,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609391-the-wright-brothers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609391-the-wright-brothers

Having enjoyed several of Pressfield’s historical novels before, I was looking forward to this latest volume, but was shocked by what I discovered; a rambling mixture of Laconophiliac hero worship, Eastern mysticism, and pop psychology. As a leader and an officer, I was so concerned by the disturbingly misogynistic and backwards-looking nature of this book that I found myself obliged to write a critique to explain the book’s glaring deficiencies, but soon realized that such a critique would only be half of what was needed; just as important would be a counterpoint to illustrate the nature of a Warrior Ethos more suited for the Information Age than the Bronze Age. Pressfield wrote his book in an attempt that was as well-intentioned as its outcome was mistaken; to define and promulgate a “Warrior Ethos” meant to help guide young (presumably American) fighting men and women along the path to success. Unfortunately, his principles, if followed to the letter, would more likely result in personal and professional failure. This book has been written to accomplish Pressfield’s intended purpose; but I propose a much different moral compass than the honor-bound, shame-based relic of dead cultures that my counterpart has offered up, and this book represents my effort to suggest a useful way forward in considering what sort of ethos modern warriors of all ages, ranks, and nationalities may find beneficial in the years to come.",3.40,124,Paperback,1,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617408-steven-pressfield-s-the-warrior-ethos,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617408-steven-pressfield-s-the-warrior-ethos

The magnitude of his past threatens to destroy everything important to Auburn, and the only way to get her life back on track is to cut Owen out of it.<br /><br />To save their relationship, all Owen needs to do is confess.

And, let s not forget that wood is expensive; on top of all the other great reasons, harvesting your own timber will save you a few bucks A concise guide for the small shop or enthusiastic hobbyist, Milling Your Own Lumber covers all of the important steps in the conversion of wood. John English takes the reader through selecting the raw material to the final drying of the harvested timber. All of the steps in between are explained in clear text accompanied with photographs and charts that make the process of milling your own lumber a guaranteed success. The process of milling your own lumber is much more than just felling the tree and sawing it into useable boards. The first consideration is, of course, what type of tree will lend itself to producing good, useable timber. Once that decision has been made the sawyer must determine how to safely fell the tree and then how to convert the log into useable lumber. The author explains and illustrates the various choices available from what types of grain pattern to expect to the many defects to be aware of. Also included is an extensive chapter on chainsaws, safety, and felling. One of the most important aspects of timber harvesting is knowing how to saw to grade . That is, how to get the best yield with the desired grain, from a specific log. Milling Your Own Lumber provides the detail and instructions for sawing to grade as well as useful information on humidity and wood, kiln and air drying, various types of kilns and milling rough boards to get them flat and straight.

Little did he know, as he kissed her good-bye, that he would spend the next three months in Iran’s most notorious prison, enduring brutal interrogation sessions at the hands of a man he knew only by his smell: Rosewater.<br /><br />For the Bahari family, wars, coups, and revolutions are not distant concepts but intimate realities they have suffered for generations: Maziar’s father was imprisoned by the shah in the 1950s, and his sister by Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1980s.

She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. <br /><br />Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a bestselling novelist, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman today—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.",4.44,52,Kindle Edition, ,12163,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738563-we-should-all-be-feminists,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738563-we-should-all-be-feminists

  <i>The case for getting back on our feet</i>
</b><br /><br />The humble act of putting one foot in front of the other transcends age, geography, culture, and class, and is one of the most economical and environmentally responsible modes of transit. Yet with our modern fixation on speed, this healthy pedestrian activity has been largely left behind.<br /><br />At a personal and professional crossroads, writer, editor, and obsessive walker Dan Rubinstein travelled throughout the U.S., U.K., and Canada to walk with people who saw the act not only as a form of transportation and recreation, but also as a path to a better world. There are no magic-bullet solutions to modern epidemics like obesity, anxiety, alienation, and climate change. But what if there is a simple way to take a step in the right direction? Combining fascinating reportage, eye-opening research, and Rubinstein’s own discoveries, <i>Born to Walk</i> explores how far this ancient habit can take us, how much repair is within range, and guarantees that you’ll never again take walking for granted.",3.74,316,Hardcover, ,35,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22750456-born-to-walk,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22750456-born-to-walk

Experience the internet's most talked-about book for yourself from the writer Cosmopolitan called “the biggest literary phenomenon of her generation.”</i><br /><br />There was the time before Tessa met Hardin, and then there’s everything AFTER... Life will never be the same. #Hessa<br /><br />Tessa is a good girl with a sweet, reliable boyfriend back home. She’s got direction, ambition, and a mother who’s intent on keeping her that way.<br /><br />But she’s barely moved into her freshman dorm when she runs into Hardin. With his tousled brown hair, cocky British accent, tattoos and lip ring, Hardin is cute and different from what she's used to.<br /><br />But he's also rude—to the point of cruelty, even. For all his attitude, Tessa should hate Hardin. And she does—until she finds herself alone with him in his room. Something about his dark mood grabs her, and when they kiss it ignites within her a passion she’s never known before.<br /><br />He'll call her beautiful, then insist he isn't the one for her and disappear again and again. Despite the reckless way he treats her, Tessa is compelled to dig deeper and find the real Hardin beneath all his lies. He pushes her away again and again, yet every time she pushes back, he only pulls her in deeper.<br /><br />Tessa already has the perfect boyfriend. So why is she trying so hard to overcome her own hurt pride and Hardin's prejudice about nice girls like her?<br /><br />Unless...could this be love?",3.74,593,Kindle Edition, ,499,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22813719-after,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22813719-after

  <i>THE THRILLING ADVENTURES OF LOVELACE AND BABBAGE</i>
</b> . . . in which Sydney Padua transforms one of the most compelling scientific collaborations into a hilarious series of adventures.<br /><br /> Meet Victorian London’s most dynamic duo: Charles Babbage, the unrealized inventor of the computer, and his accomplice, Ada, Countess of Lovelace, the peculiar protoprogrammer and daughter of Lord Byron. When Lovelace translated a description of Babbage’s plans for an enormous mechanical calculating machine in 1842, she added annotations three times longer than the original work. Her footnotes contained the first appearance of the general computing theory, a hundred years before an actual computer was built. Sadly, Lovelace died of cancer a decade after publishing the paper, and Babbage never built any of his machines.<br /><br /> But do not despair! <i>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage </i>presents a rollicking alternate reality in which Lovelace and Babbage <i>do</i> build the Difference Engine and then use it to build runaway economic models, battle the scourge of spelling errors, explore the wilder realms of mathematics, and, of course, fight crime—for the sake of both London and science. Complete with extensive footnotes that rival those penned by Lovelace herself, historical curiosities, and never-before-seen diagrams of Babbage’s mechanical, steam-powered computer, <i>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage </i>is wonderfully whimsical, utterly unusual, and, above all, entirely irresistible.<br /><br /><b>(With black-and-white illustrations throughout.) </b>",4.04,317,Hardcover, ,771,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822839-the-thrilling-adventures-of-lovelace-and-babbage,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822839-the-thrilling-adventures-of-lovelace-and-babbage

Bock takes us inside one of history's most explosively successful businesses to reveal why Google is consistently rated one of the best places to work in the world, distilling 15 years of intensive worker R&amp;D into principles that are easy to put into action, whether you're a team of one or a team of thousands.<br /><br /> WORK RULES! shows how to strike a balance between creativity and structure, leading to success you can measure in quality of life as well as market share. Read it to build a better company from within rather than from above; read it to reawaken your joy in what you do.<br /><br />",4.17,406,Hardcover, ,789,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22875447-work-rules,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22875447-work-rules

Her twin sister, Lacey, has always been the romantic who fantasized about glamour and royalty, fame and fortune. Yet it's Bex who seeks adventure at Oxford and finds herself living down the hall from Prince Nicholas, Great Britain's future king.

But the relationship also comes with unimaginable baggage: hysterical tabloids, Nick's sparkling and far more suitable ex-girlfriends, and a royal family whose private life is much thornier and more tragic than anyone on the outside knows.

Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life. It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.<br />  <br /> So if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: <i>How do we change our habits</i>?<br />  <br /><i>Better than Before</i> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits—and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin’s compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <i>Better than Before</i> explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation. <br />  <br /> Along the way, Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers readers’ most pressing questions—oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore: <br /><br />• Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I <i>love</i> to do? <br />• Sometimes I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can’t change a habit, no matter how hard I try.

He solidified his standing as the nation's foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election. Silver is the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight.com.<br /><br /> Drawing on his own groundbreaking work, Silver examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data. Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the “prediction paradox”: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.<br /><br /> In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good—or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary—and dangerous—science.<br /><br /> Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.<br /><br /> With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver’s insights are an essential read.",3.98,560,Paperback, ,34,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22891356-the-signal-and-the-noise,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22891356-the-signal-and-the-noise

It is the road on which nearly everyone who wants to write—and many of the people who do write—get lost.” <br /> <br />So writes Ann Patchett in “The Getaway Car,” a wry, wisdom-packed memoir of her life as a writer. Here, for the first time, one of America’s most celebrated authors (“State of Wonder,” “Bel Canto,” “Truth and Beauty”), talks at length about her literary career—the highs and the lows—and shares advice on the craft and art of writing. In this fascinating look at the development of a novelist, we meet Patchett’s mentors (Allan Gurganas, Grace Paley, Russell Banks), see where she made wrong turns (poetry), and learn how she gets the pages written (an unromantic process of pure hard work). Woven through engaging anecdotes from Patchett’s life are lessons about writing that offer an inside peek into the storytelling process and provide a blueprint for anyone wanting to give writing a serious try. The bestselling author gives pointers on everything from finding ideas to constructing a plot to combating writer’s block. More than that, she conveys the joys and rewards of a life spent reading and writing. <br /> <br />“What I like about the job of being a novelist, and at the same time what I find so exhausting about it, is that it’s the closest thing to being God that you’re ever going to get,” she writes. “All of the decisions are yours. You decide when the sun comes up. You decide who gets to fall in love...” <br /> <br />In this Byliner Original, “The Getaway Car” is a delightful autobiography-cum-user’s guide that appeals to both aspiring writers and anyone who loves a great story. <br /> <br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR <br /> <br />Ann Patchett is the author of eight books, including “Bel Canto,” which won the PEN/Faulkner Award, England’s Orange Prize, and the Book Sense Book of the Year and has been translated into more than thirty languages.

Og innimellom alt leven og latter fortel Trille lågmælt om alvor og sorg i eit ni år gammalt liv, og om redsla for å miste dei han er glad i.<br /><br />Illustrert av Bo Gaustad.<br /><br />Boka blei nominert til Brageprisen 2005, med følgjande grunngiving:<br /><br />«Som en rykende ferskvaffel-plate seiler debutanten Maria Parr inn i bokhøsten med en overbevisende smakfull høytlesningsbok, med ramsalt humor, elleville påfunn, finurlige ordspill, lekne kommentarer og uventet dramatikk. Men også alvorlige tema som kjønnsrollemønster, vennskap, flytting, døden, kjærligheten og noe så viktigsom å fikse en ny pappa når mamma er litt for treig på avtrekkeren. I en Astrid Lindgrensk atmosfære tar jeg-fortelleren Trille oss med til den lille kystbygda med kallenavnet Knert-Mathilde, hvor han sammen med bestevennen og nabojente Lena gjør sommersprell med påfallende høy risikofaktor. Mye takket være en farfar med toleranseterskel til ettertanke lander de fleste påfunnene med fred og fornuftig forsoning.

From our morning toast to the cotton in our clothes, they are quite literally the stuff and staff of life: supporting diets, economies, and civilizations around the globe. Just as the search for nutmeg and pepper drove the Age of Discovery, coffee beans fueled the Enlightenment and cottonseed sparked the Industrial Revolution. Seeds are fundamental objects of beauty, evolutionary wonders, and simple fascinations. Yet, despite their importance, seeds are often seen as commonplace, their extraordinary natural and human histories overlooked. Thanks to this stunning new book, they can be overlooked no more. This is a book of knowledge, adventure, and wonder, spun by an award-winning writer with both the charm of a fireside story-teller and the hard-won expertise of a field biologist. A fascinating scientific adventure, it is essential reading for anyone who loves to see a plant grow.</b>",4.08,277,Hardcover, ,251,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23013818-the-triumph-of-seeds,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23013818-the-triumph-of-seeds

Almost every failed startup has a product. What failed startups don't have is traction -- real customer growth. <br /> <br />This book introduces startup founders and employees to the ""Bullseye Framework,"" a five-step process successful companies use to get traction. This framework helps founders find the marketing channel that will be key to unlocking the next stage of growth. <br /> <br />Traction is a guide to getting customers, written for startup founders, marketers, and those interested in how today's startups grow and get traction. This book shows you how the founders of several of the biggest companies and organizations in the world like Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Alexis Ohanian (Reddit), Paul English (Kayak.com) and Alex Pachikov (Evernote) have built and grown their startups. We interviewed over forty successful founders and researched countless more growth stories to pull out the repeatable tactics and strategies they used to get traction. <br /> <br />""Many entrepreneurs who build great products simply don't have a good distribution strategy."" -- Mark Andreessen, venture capitalist <br /> <br />Too often, startups spend months (or years) building a product only to struggle with traction once they launch. This struggle has startups trying random tactics - some ads, a blog post or two - in an unstructured way that leads to failure. Traction shows readers how to systematically approach marketing, and covers how successful businesses have grown through each of the following channels: <br /> <br />Viral Marketing <br />Public Relations (PR) <br />Unconventional PR <br />Search Engine Marketing (SEM) <br />Social and Display Ads <br />Offline Ads <br />Search Engine Optimization (SEO) <br />Content Marketing <br />Email Marketing <br />Engineering as Marketing <br />Target Market Blogs <br />Business Development (BD) <br />Sales <br />Affiliate Programs <br />Existing Platforms <br />Trade Shows <br />Offline Events <br />Speaking Engagements <br />Community Building <br /> <br />This book draws on interviews we conducted with the following individuals: <br />Jimmy Wales, Co-founder of Wikipedia <br />Alexis Ohanian, Co-founder of reddit <br />Eric Ries, Author of The Lean Startup <br />Sam Yagan, Co-founder of OkCupid and CEO of Match.com <br />Jason Cohen, Founder of WP Engine <br />Chris Fralic, Partner at First Round Capital <br />Rand Fishkin, Founder of SEOmoz <br />Noah Kagan, Founder of AppSumo <br />Jason Kincaid, Blogger at TechCrunch <br />Alex Pachikov, Co-founder of Evernote <br />Ryan Holiday, Exec at American Apparel <br />Andrew Warner, Founder of Mixergy <br />Garry Tan, Partner at Y Combinator <br />and many more.",4.16,258,Kindle Edition, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23110525-traction,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23110525-traction

A big, towering athlete, he was the only person from his hometown of Burlington ever to go pro. But his career ended before it had a chance to begin. On his very first play, a violent helmet-to-helmet collision knocked him off the field for good, and left him with an improbable side effect--he can never forget anything.<br /><br />The second time was at home nearly two decades later. Now a police detective, Decker returned from a stakeout one evening and entered a nightmare--his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law had been murdered.<br /><br />His family destroyed, their killer's identity as mysterious as the motive behind the crime, and unable to forget a single detail from that horrible night, Decker finds his world collapsing around him. He leaves the police force, loses his home, and winds up on the street, taking piecemeal jobs as a private investigator when he can.<br /><br />But over a year later, a man turns himself in to the police and confesses to the murders. At the same time a horrific event nearly brings Burlington to its knees, and Decker is called back in to help with this investigation. Decker also seizes his chance to learn what really happened to his family that night. To uncover the stunning truth, he must use his remarkable gifts and confront the burdens that go along with them. He must endure the memories he would much rather forget. And he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br /><i>Memory Man</i> will stay with you long after the turn of the final page.",4.07,416,Hardcover, ,4963,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23153154-memory-man,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23153154-memory-man

As they helped grow Google from a young start-up to a global icon, they relearned everything they knew about management. <i>How Google Works</i> is the sum of those experiences distilled into a fun, easy-to-read primer on corporate culture, strategy, talent, decision-making, communication, innovation, and dealing with disruption.<br /><br />The authors explain how the confluence of three seismic changes - the internet, mobile, and cloud computing - has shifted the balance of power from companies to consumers. The companies that will thrive in this ever-changing landscape will be the ones that create superior products and attract a new breed of multifaceted employees whom the authors dub 'smart creatives'. The management maxims ('Consensus requires dissension', 'Exile knaves but fight for divas', 'Think 10X, not 10%') are illustrated with previously unreported anecdotes from Google's corporate history.<br /><br />'Back in 2010, Eric and I created an internal class for Google managers,' says Rosenberg.

Have you been wondering if you should turn your side hustle or hobby into your own small business? Have you struggled with how or when to launch as a solopreneur? <i>Go Solo</i> has your answers.<br /><br />First, Humphreys tackles <b>how to know you're picking the <i>right</i> business for you.</b> This book is not about start ups, apps, or making easy money online. This book is perfect for the aspiring freelancer, writer, designer, consultant, coach, photographer, counselor, event planner, interior designer or decorator, software developer, crafter or blogger, even plumbers, builders, realtors and developers, or insurance agents. This book is for you if you ARE your brand or want to become your own brand, long to live on your own terms and do work that really matters, all with little overhead.<br /><br /><b>Starting the journey from employee to owner brings up a lot of questions. Go Solo will answer:</b><br /> 
   As an entrepreneur with many passions and strengths, How do you know you've chosen the right passion?  
   How can you be sure you'll be great at what you choose?  
   Once you choose the absolute best business for you, how do you start and gain momentum while you are still employed?  
   How can you position yourself so your ideal clients and customers, and a possible Big Break Out Opportunity, can easily find you?  
   Lastly, when should you launch?  
   What should you name your business?  
   How do you market effectively as a solopreneur with no big office or employees?  
 As Associate Creative Director at one of the biggest and best agencies in Oklahoma, Humphreys enjoyed her job but <b>""felt like I was meant to be doing something else, something more. I felt listless and anxious, so I started to prepare for my journey, which eventually led to starting my own business with an international first client.""</b><br /><br /><b>Don't wait</b> until someone else lands that big client that would have been a perfect first client for you. <b>Don't wait</b> until someone else launches a product that you thought of two years ago! You were not created to build someone else's dream at the expense of your own. <b>You can make a difference in this world while also achieving success and freedom.</b> You can start from home and use simple strategies while still employed to make your departure faster than ever.<br /><br />By the end of this book, if you cover each section in a week (though you can do it in less!) in just three months you'll have a mission, vision, plan and marketing strategy. You will enjoy passion-filled days and know that every ounce of effort actually affects your bottom line. You will be impacting lives and serving others with your unique talents. <b>You will be totally set up for solopreneur success!</b>",4.07,176,Kindle Edition, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23255844-go-solo,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23255844-go-solo

  <p>Some things about babies, happily, will never change. They still arrive warm, cuddly, soft, and smelling impossibly sweet. But how moms and dads care for their brand-new bundles of baby joy has changed—and now, so has the new-baby bible. <br /><br /> Announcing the completely revised third edition of <i>What to Expect the First Year</i>. With over 10.5 million copies in print, <i>First Year</i> is the world’s best-selling, best-loved guide to the instructions that babies don’t come with, but should. And now, it’s better than ever. Every parent’s must-have/go-to is completely updated. <br /><br /> Keeping the trademark month-by-month format that allows parents to take the potentially overwhelming first year one step at a time, <i>First Year</i> is easier-to-read, faster-to-flip-through, and new-family-friendlier than ever—packed with even more practical tips, realistic advice, and relatable, accessible information than before. Illustrations are new, too. <br /><br /> Among the changes: Baby care fundamentals—crib and sleep safety, feeding, vitamin supplements—are revised to reflect the most recent guidelines. Breastfeeding gets more coverage, too, from getting started to keeping it going. Hot-button topics and trends are tackled: attachment parenting, sleep training, early potty learning (elimination communication), baby-led weaning, and green parenting (from cloth diapers to non-toxic furniture). An all-new chapter on buying for baby helps parents navigate through today’s dizzying gamut of baby products, nursery items, and gear. Also new: tips on preparing homemade baby food, the latest recommendations on starting solids, research on the impact of screen time (TVs, tablets, apps, computers), and “For Parents” boxes that focus on mom’s and dad’s needs. Throughout, topics are organized more intuitively than ever, for the best user experience possible.</p>

In it, Thomas and the other survivors of the Glade find themselves once again in a situation of horror, forced to leave the perceived safety into which they were taken after escaping the Maze. The Scorch Trials of the book’s title are supposed to be another step in identifying for WICKED a cure to the plague, the Flare, which emerged in the wake of the solar scorching of much of the planet. Will they succeed? <br /> <br />James Dashner's The Scorch Trials also continues the story of Thomas and his companions as they negotiate the tests set forth by the international organization WICKED. They are purportedly working toward a cure for the virulent mind-destroying plague, the Flare, but there are so many lies about that nobody can be sure what is really going on. <br /> <br />The Scorch Trials is not only entertaining read, but also contains a strong message to its readers which cuts across different age groups.

Although he wasn’t yet a big star, it was a groundbreaking moment. And over the years, Bowie has failed to give an uninteresting interview. It might be said that he has habitually used the media for his own ends, but he has paradoxically also been searingly honest, declining to ever be coy about his ambitions, his private life, and even his occasional ennui.<br />  <br /><i>Bowie on Bowie </i>presents some of the best interviews Bowie has granted in his near five-decade career. Each interview traces a new step in his unique journey, successively freezing him in time as young novelty hit-maker, hairy hippie, Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, the Thin White Duke, plastic soul man, fragile Germanic exile, godfather of the New Romantics, eighties sellout, Tin Machinist, and, finally, permanently, artistically reborn beloved elder statesman of challenging popular music. In all of these iterations he is remarkably articulate. He is also preternaturally polite—almost every interviewer remarks upon his charm.<br />  <br /> The features in this book come from outlets both prestigious (<i>Melody</i> <i>Maker, Mojo, New Musical Express,</i> <i>Q, Rolling Stone</i>) and less well-known (<i>The Drummer, Guitar,</i> <i>Ikon, </i>Mr. Showbiz). In all cases, Bowie enables the reader to approach the nerve center of his ferociously creative and prolific output.<br />",3.85,432,Hardcover, ,31,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23359689-bowie-on-bowie,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23359689-bowie-on-bowie

With only a few months to live, he has been medically paroled to a nursing home, after spending thirty years in prison for the crimes of rape and murder.<br /><br />As Joe writes about Carl's life, especially Carl's valor in Vietnam, he cannot reconcile the heroism of the soldier with the despicable acts of the convict.
