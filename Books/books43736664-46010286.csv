After the publication of A Brief History of Time, he became an international celebrity. Though the book sold in the millions, few readers really grasped the significance of his groundbreaking work. Now popular Austrian science blogger Florian Freistetter, himself an astronomer, makes Hawking's contributions accessible to everyday readers in this concise, very readable book.<br /><br />By focusing on the essentials, Freistetter deftly and entertainingly makes Hawking's complex theoretical accomplishments understandable. Avoiding technicalities and jargon, he elucidates the great scientist's fascinating work on black holes, gravitational waves, the big bang, and singularities. Concluding with an appreciation of Hawking as a science communicator and popularizer, Freistetter conveys the importance of Hawking's scientific research in terms that nonspecialists can follow.",3.97,96,Hardcover, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43736664-stephen-hawking,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43736664-stephen-hawking

When the students' answers raise disturbing questions of their own, Ms. Witt knows there's more going on the school than the faculty wants to see. She soon learns about The Ten--the students at the top of the school's social hierarchy--as well as their connection to something called The Darkroom.<br /><br />Ms. Witt can't remain a passive observer. She finds the few girls who've started to question the school's ""boys will be boys"" attitude and incites a resistance that quickly becomes a movement.

Shy loner Norman hates his role in the Darkroom, but can't find the courage to fight back until he makes an unlikely alliance.

Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.<br /><br />What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck</i>, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.<br /><br />Now, in <i>Everthing Is F*cked</i>, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.<br /><br />With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",3.74,288,Hardcover, ,2260,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43808723-everything-is-f-cked,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43808723-everything-is-f-cked

Fela, taken from Africa, is working at her second sugar plantation in colonial Puerto Rico, where her mistress is only too happy to benefit from her impressive embroidery skills. But Fela has a secret. Before she and her husband were separated and sold into slavery, they performed a tribal ceremony in which they poured the essence of their unborn child into a very special stone. Fela keeps the stone with her, waiting for the chance to finish what she started. When the plantation owner approaches her, Fela sees a better opportunity for her child, and allows the man to act out his desire.

How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true? <br /><br />Talking to Strangers is a classically Gladwellian intellectual adventure, a challenging and controversial excursion through history, psychology, and scandals taken straight from the news. He revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, the suicide of Sylvia Plath, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia scandal at Penn State University, and the death of Sandra Bland---throwing our understanding of these and other stories into doubt. Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. <br /><br />In his first book since his #1 bestseller, David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell has written a gripping guidebook for troubled times.",4.04,320,Hardcover, ,232,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43812079-talking-to-strangers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43812079-talking-to-strangers

Since the first Earth Day in 1970, the reigning argument has been that taking better care of the planet means radically changing course: reducing our consumption, tightening our belts, learning to share and reuse, restraining growth. Is that argument correct?<br /> <br />Absolutely <i>not</i>. In <i>More from Less, </i>McAfee argues that to solve our ecological problems we don’t need to make radical changes. Instead, we need to do more of what we’re already doing: growing technologically sophisticated market-based economies around the world. <br /> <br />How can he possibly make this claim? Because of the evidence. America—a large, high-tech country that accounts for about 25% of the global economy—is now generally using<i> less</i> of most resources year after year, even as its economy and population continue to grow. What’s more, the US is polluting the air and water less, emitting fewer greenhouse gases, and replenishing endangered animal populations. And, as McAfee shows, America is not alone. Other countries are also transforming themselves in fundamental ways.<br /> <br />What has made this turnabout possible? One thing, primarily: the collaboration between technology and capitalism, although good governance and public awareness have also been critical. McAfee does warn of issues that haven’t been solved, like global warming, overfishing, and communities left behind as capitalism and tech progress race forward.

They don't speak anymore, but Mickey never stops worrying about her sibling. <br /><br />Then Kacey disappears, suddenly, at the same time that a mysterious string of murders begins in Mickey's district, and Mickey becomes dangerously obsessed with finding the culprit--and her sister--before it's too late.<br /><br />Alternating its present-day mystery with the story of the sisters' childhood and adolescence, Long Bright River is at once heart-pounding and heart-wrenching: a gripping suspense novel that is also a moving story of sisters, addiction, and the formidable ties that persist between place, family, and fate.",4.06,482,Hardcover, ,5091,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43834909-long-bright-river,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43834909-long-bright-river

Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.<br /><br />But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world–until the unthinkable happens.<br /><br />In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery.

Springing into post-World War II society, and quite naughty and haughty, she lived in a whirlwind of fame and notoriety.

The royal socialite, cigarette holder in one hand, cocktail in the other, sparkles in the company of her glittering entourage of wealthy young aristocrats known as the Margaret Set, but her outrageous lifestyle conflicts with her place as Queen Elizabeth’s younger sister. Can she be a dutiful princess while still dazzling the world on her own terms?<br /><br />Post-war Britain isn’t glamorous for The Honorable Vera Strathmore. While writing scandalous novels, she dreams of living and working in New York, and regaining the happiness she enjoyed before her fiancé was killed in the war. A chance meeting with the Princess changes her life forever. Vera amuses the princess, and what—or who—Margaret wants, Margaret gets. Soon, Vera gains Margaret’s confidence and the privileged position of second lady-in-waiting to the Princess.

No other investor--Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros--can touch his record. Since 1988, Renaissance's signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent.

Senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency, placing Steve Bannon in the campaign and funding Trump's victorious 2016 effort.

And then Donald Trump happens. In a torpor of despair, she decides that she’s had enough of the privileged bubble she’s lived in—a bubble within a bubble—and that it’s time to make some changes, both in her personal life and in the world at large.<br /><br />At home, she embarks on a year of self-sufficiency—learning how to work the remote, how to pick up dog shit, where to find the toaster. She meets her match in an earnest, brainy psychiatrist and enters into therapy, prepared to do the heavy lifting required to look within and make sense of a childhood marked by love and loss and to figure out why people are afraid of her. She becomes politically active—finding her voice as an advocate for change, having difficult conversations, and energizing her base. In the process, she develops a healthy fixation on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and, through unflinching self-reflection and psychological excavation, unearths some glittering truths that light up the road ahead. <br /><br />Thrillingly honest, insightful, and deeply, darkly funny, Chelsea Handler’s memoir keeps readers laughing, even as it inspires us to look within and ask ourselves what really matters in our own lives.<br /><br /><b>Advance praise for </b><i>

Beyond his success, though, Shandling struggled with fame, the industry of art, and the childhood loss of his brother, which forever affected his personal and professional lives. His diaries show Shandling to be self-aware and insightful, revealing a deep philosophical and spiritual side. Contributions by comedians and other leading lights of the industry, as well as people who grew up with Shandling, along with never-before-seen pieces of scripts and brilliant jokes that he never performed, shed new light on every facet of his life and work.

But with the unexpected death of her husband, her life became an empty, lightless space. Suddenly she was the single mother of two young boys, a widow at forty, clinging to three crumpled pages of instructions her husband had written for things like grocery shopping--things he had done while she did pioneering work as a planetary scientist at MIT. She became painfully conscious of her Asperger's, which before losing her husband had felt more like background noise. She felt, for the first time, alone in the universe.<br /> In this probing, invigoratingly honest memoir, Seager tells the story of how, as she stumblingly navigated the world of grief, she also kept looking for other worlds. She continues to develop groundbreaking projects, such as the Starshade, a sunflower-shaped instrument that, when launched into space, unfurls itself so as to block planet-obscuring starlight, and she takes solace in the alien beauty of exoplanets. At the same time, she discovers what feels every bit as wondrous: other people, reaching out across the space of her grief. Among them are the Widows of Concord, a group of women offering consolation and advice; and her beloved sons, Max and Alex.

</b><br /><br />Every plantation is a house of spies and intrigue, engineered to hide a fundamental reality: that it is built on slavery and built by the enslaved, its true geniuses and laborers stashed away in basements and fields, sleeping under beds and entering drawing rooms from passageways hidden behind sliding walls, their faces masks of compliance, their hearts beating with betrayal and insurrection. But against whom?<br /><br />Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage—and lost his mother and all memory of her when he was a child—but he is also gifted with a mysterious power. Hiram almost drowns when he crashes a carriage into a river, but is saved from the depths by a force he doesn't understand, a blue light that lifts him up and lands him a mile away. This strange brush with death forces a new urgency on Hiram's private rebellion. Spurred on by his improvised plantation family, Thena, his chosen mother, a woman of few words and many secrets, and Sophia, a young woman fighting her own war even as she and Hiram fall in love, he becomes determined to escape the only home he's ever known.<br /><br />So begins an unexpected journey into the covert war on slavery that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia's proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the deep South to dangerously utopic movements in the North. Even as he's enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, all Hiram wants is to return to the Walker Plantation to free the family he left behind—but to do so, he must first master his magical gift and reconstruct the story of his greatest loss.<br /><br />This is a bracingly original vision of the world of slavery, written with the narrative force of a great adventure. Driven by the author's bold imagination and striking ability to bring readers deep into the interior lives of his brilliantly rendered characters, <i>The Water Dancer</i> is the story of America's oldest struggle—the struggle to tell the truth--from one of our most exciting thinkers and beautiful writers.",4.07,432,Kindle Edition, ,779,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43996589-the-water-dancer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43996589-the-water-dancer

What does Starbucks have to thank for its global domination? What has protected the lives of popes for millennia? Why did Scotland surrender its sovereignty to England?

یگانه فرزند حاج محمد اسماعیل شکرچی که بعداً به یگانه تبدیل شد در سال 1302 در زنجان متولد شد. پس از پایان تحصیلات در این شهر برای ادامه تحصیل دانشگاهی به تهران و سپس برای ادامه تحصیلات تکمیلی به آمریکا می‌رود. وی در سال 1949 وارد سازمان ملل می‌شود و خاطره خود را از ارتباط اولیه با سازمان ملل چنین شرح می‌دهد: «یک روز تلفنی شد که اینجا سازمان ملل است و ما می‌خواهیم بدانیم که آیا شما علاقه‌مند به کار در این دستگاه هستید یا نه؟ چیز عجیبی بود و من فکر می‌کردم بعضی از رفقای ما که با همدیگر شوخی دارند یکی از این‌ها دارد با ما من شوخی می‌کند. در آوریل 1949 من (در سازمان ملل) استخدام شدم و روی مسایل خاورمیانه داشتم کار می‌کردم که از جمله مسایل انرژی بود. در آن موقع اطلاعات راجع به نفت در خارج بسیار کم بود. گزارش صد صفحه‌ای برایشان تهیه کردم که اینها اصلاً باورشان نشد که چطور فرضاً در آن موقع مقدار استثمار به چه اندازه است».<br />وی خاطره تهیه نطق برای سخنرانی دکتر مصدق در سازمان ملل را چنین شرح داده است: «دکتر مصدق تصمیم گرفته که بیاید خودش برای دفاع، این‏ها خودشان را آماده می‌کردند. به من تلفن کردند، بیایید به ما کمک کنید. من «علی آغاسی» که در قسمت شورای امنیت سازمان ملل کار می‌کرد و دوست ایشان به نام «شوارتز» سه نفره نطقی تهیه کردیم. آقای مصدق، صالح، شایگان، سنجابی، بقایی و عده دیگر نطق دیگری تهیه کردند. مصدق در مقابل این قرار گرفت که دو تا نطق وجود داشت که می‌بایستی انتخاب کند. برده بودند پیش مصدق، مصدق دیده بود این چیزی را که ما تهیه کرده بودم گفته بود «بدون هیچگونه تغییری از اول تا آخر این بایستی خوانده شود. پس از ایراد نطق، مصدق ما را به حضورش خواست و اظهار محبت کرد و خیلی تشکر و گفت شما آقا جایتان اینجا نیست و بایستی برگردید به ایران و خدمت کنید».<br />محمد یگانه که در 1349 به اتفاق چند تن از دوستانش انجمن ایران و آمریکا را تأسیس کرد، در این خصوص چنین می‌گوید: «ما به کارهای بیشتر اجتماعی می‌پرداختیم و ایرانی‌ها را دور هم جمع کردیم. در این انجمن تجار و مامورین دولت و سیاستمداران سابق و محصلین و غیره حضور داشتند. انتشاراتی داشتیم برای شناساندن ایران به آمریکایی‌ها، که خیلی محدود بود. این فعالیت‌ها خیلی موفقیت‏آمیز بود».<br />پس از اینکه یگانه یک سال در هیات مدیره بانک بین‌الملل عضویت داشت، هویدا به منزل وی تلفن کرده و از وی می‌خواهد که رئیس بانک مرکزی شود: «هویدا اصرار کرد که مسئولیت بانک مرکزی را بنده قبول کنم بانک مرکزی یک دستگاه صالحی بود، من هم علاقه‌ام خدمت به مملکت خود بود، ولی درست از اوضاع و احوال اطلاع نداشتم. وقتی که رفتم دیدم نه این‏ها آماده هستند که تا حدی استقلال عمل بدهند و غیره و این‏ها که ما بتوانیم کار خودمان را انجام بدهیم بدون دخالت ناروای زیاد، من قبول کردم. مسئولیت خیلی مهمی بود و می‌توانست کارهای خودش را از روی اصول انجام بدهد. ما توانستیم موجودی‌های ارزی‌مان که بیش از یکی دو میلیارد دلار نبود را به حدود ده میلیارد دلار برسانیم».<br />وی کمک‌های مالی ایران به کشورهای مختلف جهان را چنین شرح داده است: «وزارت دارایی هرچه که به دستشان می‌رسید دنبال خرج کردن بودند و مرتب به کشورهای دیگر کمک‌هایی انجام می‌دادند، مثلا پاکستان چه مقدار پول‌هایی گرفت به چه عناوین و یا مصر و غیره. ما برای ترکیه مثلاً یک میلیارد و ششصد میلیون دلار، آقای انصاری رفته بود قول داده بود که به این‏ها کمک بشود و همینطور اندونزی، مکزیک، برزیل و غیره».<br />محمد یگانه خاطرات خود را از جلسات شورای عالی اقتصاد چنین شرح داده است: «اگرچه اسم این شورای اقتصادی جنبه شورا داشت، ولی در عمل بیشتر جنبه ابلاغ دستورات و اوامر را داشت تا اینکه مسائل در اینجا مطرح بشود. در هر حال این شورای اقتصاد که آن به صورت قانونی به وجود آمده بود و در قانون برنامه و بودجه وجود داشت و برنامه پنج‌ساله و غیره و ریاست آن جلسه را و اجلاسیه‌های این‏ها را شاه به عهده داشت. حالا من نمی‌دانم از نقطه‌نظر قانون اساسی چه جنبه‌ای داشت، هیچ‌وقت من مطالعه نکردم و مطالعه هم نشده بود. ولی بیشتر شورای اقتصاد برای ابلاغ دستور و اوامر شاه بود و در عین حال آگاهی ماموران عالی‌رتبه دولت در سطح وزرا از اینکه نظرات ایشان چیست و دنبال چه کارهایی بایستی بروند و کارهای خودشان را با هم تلفیق بکنند و هماهنگ بکنند. در این باره برای اینکه این کارها هم این دستورات هم روی اصولی جلو برود که بسته به شرایط آن زمان داشت، طوری کرده بودند که از طرف آقای هویدا و دولت آن روز که قبلاً یک جلسه مقدماتی تشکیل بدهند و مطالبی را که بایستی ببرند به حضور شاه آن مطالب قبلا درباره آنها مذاکره بشود و معلوم بشود که اولا کدام مسائل را بایستی ببرند پیش او. بعد از اینکه نظرشان با همدیگر هماهنگ شد و اختلافات خودشان (را) با همدیگر حل کردند و غیره ببرند پیش شاه و سعی هم می‌شد که اگر گرفتاری‌هایی دارند این گرفتاری را خیلی کوچک جلوه بدهند و در حضور شاه فقط آن مسائلی مطرح می‌شد که ایشان علاقه داشتند یا قبلا گفته بودند در نامه‌های مختلف‌شان و غیره دستوراتی یا اوامری داده بودند. یا اطلاعاتی خواسته بودند. پس در این جلسات به این ترتیب مطالبی می‌رفت که یا مورد علاقه وی بود یا اینکه به نحوی از انحاء دولت تشخیص می‌داد پیش ایشان برود. اگر یکی از وزرا در این صحبت‌ها از مسیر خودش خارج می‌شد، یا در همان جلسه، فوری آقای هویدا یا رییس سازمان برنامه یا وزیر مشاور آقای اصفیاء اشاره می‌کردند که بله قربان اجازه داده بشود که این مساله مورد مطالعه بیشتر قرار بگیرد تا بروند با همدیگر صحبت‌هایشان را بکنند و بعداً بیاورند».<br />وی روحیه شاه را پس از فاجعه 17 شهریور چنین به یاد می‌آورد: «یک روز پس از 17 شهریور شرفیاب می‌شدم پیش شاه می‌رفتم برای گزارش، در آنجا وضع بسیار ناراحت کننده‌ای دیدم. ما می‌رفتیم معمولاً پیش شاه، ایشان می آمدند و سرپاگزارش را می‌خواستند و توضیحاتی نظرات خودشان را می‌گفتند یا اوامری صادر می‌کردند و غیره. هرشخص هم پانزده دقیقه، نیم ساعت صحبت می‌کردند. ولی این دفعه شاه دستور دادند: «بیایید بنشینید ایشان هم نشستند و بعد تمام ذکرش روی این مسایل بود که چرا این وضع بوجود آمده؟ در مقابلش یک کاخی که ساخته بودند این کاخ کاملاً ریخته بود. فکر می‌کرد که تمام کارگران کشور، دهقانان کشور، انتلکوئل‌ها، روشنفکران، بازاری‏ها و غیره بعد از این همه مللکت ترقیاتی که کرده و زحماتی که ایشان کشیدند همه‌شان پشتیبان هستند. چه طور حالا مردم آمدند و «مرگ برشاه» می‌گویند». <br />وی «بی‌خبری شخص شاه از اوضاع داخلی» را چنین شرح می‌دهد: «شاه در موقعیتی نبود که مسایل مملکتی را آن اندازه‌ای که هویدا از آن اطلاع دارد در جریان بوده باشد، با مردم در تماس نبود، یک عده محدود درباری ایشان را احاطه کرده بودند اطلاعاتی که به ایشان می‌رسید این اطلاعات محدود بود چنان اطلاعاتی بود که فقط برای خوشحالی ایشان بود که اوضاع و احوال مملکت از هرلحاظ خوب است. شاه به صورت بی‌نظر و غرض کمتر اطلاعاتی از وضع کشور دریافت می‌کرد در حالی که هویدا با تماس زیادی که با مردم داشت، با هوش زیادی که داشت با مطالعاتی که نه تنها از اوضاع کشور بلکه از کشورهای دیگر از اوضاعی که در خارج می‌گذرد بیشتر در جریان اوضاع و احوال بود و می‌توانست شاه را کمک بیشتری بکند. هویدا می‌دانست بدبختی‌های (مردم) کجاست، به دهات می‌رفت به پایین شهر می‌رفت. تمام گرفتاری‌ها را زیر فرش کردن به صلاح نه مملکت و نه به صلاح خودش نه به صلاح شاه بود».<br />محمد یگانه خاطره خود را استقرار دولت نظامی و خروجش از ایران را نقل می‌کند: «حکومت نظامی سرکار آمد. در این حکومت نظامی تصمیم داشتند مرا نگه دارند. همان ساعت هفت صبح از من خواستند که بروم برای معرفی. قره‌باغی دوبار تلفن کرد، بعد از آن مقدم تلفن کرد، بعد از آن اویسی تلفن کرد، با تحکم مثل این که دستور ارتشی می‌دهند. پاسخ من این بود که من بایستی بروم و شاهنشاه هم قبول کردند، حال و وضع من خوب نیست، برای معالجه می‌خواهم بروم. چهار روز بعد دیگر من آمده بودم از ایران، به خارج رفتم که بروم معالجه بکنم. در هوستون، واقعاً حال مزاجی‌ام خوب نبود و دکترها چنین دستوری داده بودند. بعد از پایان استراحت می‌خواستم برگردم به ایران در آن موقع همه از ایران فرار می‌کردند حتی بلیط خودم را گرفتم بروم به ایران». <br />یگانه در بخش‌های سیاسی خاطراتش موضوعاتی همچون «نقش مقامات در تصمیم‌گیری‌های شاه، اولویت‌های شاه، نشانه‌های سقوط رژیم پهلوی، واقعه 17 شهریور، حکومت نظامی در 17 شهریور، دولت و اعتصابات، نقش فرح در آخرین ماه‌ها، برکناری نصیری، دستگیری هویدا، قرار داد 1975 الجزایر، دیدار شاه و صدام، تخلفات بنیاد پهلوی، دکتر اقبال، حسین فردوست، شریف امامی، مهدی بازرگان، اسدالله علم، ارتشبد اویسی، فرح، اردشیر زاهدی، امیر عباس هویدا، جمشید آموزگار، شاپور بختیار و چند چهره دیگر» را مورد بررسی قرار داده است. <br />یگانه در خاطرات اقتصادی خود نیز موضوعات متنوعی همچون «دلیل استعفای عالیخانی از وزات اقتصاد، ماجرای ساخت ذوب‌آهن توسط روس‌ها، خانه‌سازی برای کارگران، وام به دولت‌های خارجی، سرمایه‌گذاری در انرژی اتمی، شهرسازی فرح در سنگال، چاپ اسکناس در ایتالیا، ستاره داود روی اسکناس‌ها، حل مشکل ستاره داود توسط جمهوری اسلامی، هژبر یزدانی، اختلاف نظر با ساواک، بانک ایران و ژاپن، برادران رضایی، گزارش وضع اقتصادی کشور به دولت و شاه، دخالت روزافزون دربار در کارها، پخش مذاکرات بازرسی شاهنشاهی در تلویزیون» از دیگر بخش های این کتاب 368 صفحه ای است. کتاب فاقد «فهرست و نمایه» بوده و همین امر می‌تواند نقطه ضعف کتاب تلقی گردد.<br />در میان شمار قابل توجهی از مدیران اقتصادی که در رژیم گذشته از تصمیم‌گیران مهم و تاثیرگذار بودند، محمد یگانه در چهار منصب رییس کل بانک مرکزی، وزیر دارایی، وزیر مشاور و وزیر آبادانی و مسکن فعالیت کرد. این مدیر ارشد اقتصادی که در دوره‌ای در سازمان ملل متحد نیز شاغل بوده 23 سال برای نهادهای مختلف آن فعالیت داشت، به مدت 13 سال در ایران مناصب یاد شده را در اختیار داشت. پس از پیروزی انقلاب اسلامی وی مجددا در صندوق بین‌المللی پول مشغول به فعالیت شد و در دانشگاه کلمبیا نیز تدریس نمود.,3.62, , ,

There was just one problem: Saro’s traditional Sicilian family did not approve of him marrying a black American woman, an actress no less. However, the couple, heartbroken but undeterred, forges on. They build a happy life in Los Angeles, with fulfilling careers, deep friendships and the love of their lives: a baby girl they adopt at birth. Eventually, they reconcile with Saro’s family just as he faces a formidable cancer that will consume all their dreams.<br /> <br /> <i>From Scratch </i>chronicles three summers Tembi spends in Sicily with her daughter, Zoela, as she begins to piece together a life without her husband in his tiny hometown hamlet of farmers. Where once Tembi was estranged from Saro’s family and his origins, now she finds solace and nourishment—literally and spiritually—at her mother in law’s table. In the Sicilian countryside, she discovers the healing gifts of simple fresh food, the embrace of a close knit community, and timeless traditions and wisdom that light a path forward. All along the way she reflects on her and Saro’s incredible romance—an indelible love story that leaps off the pages.<br /> <br /> In Sicily, it is said that every story begins with a marriage or a death—in Tembi Locke’s case, it is both. Her story is about loss, but it’s really about love found. Her story is about travel, but it’s really about finding a home. It is about food, but it’s really about chasing flavor as an act of remembrance. <i>From Scratch </i>is for anyone who has dared to reach for big love, fought for what mattered most, and needed a powerful reminder that life is…delicious.",3.87,352,Kindle Edition, ,109,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44012029-from-scratch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44012029-from-scratch

The abandoned homes and desolate beaches make them shy of each other, and, isolated in their new marriage, they decide to cut their trip short.<br /><br />But before they leave, they encounter their glamorous, sensual neighbors and become swept up by their drama. Clara, a beautiful socialite who feels her youth slipping away; Max, a wealthy playboy and Clara’s lover; and Alma, Max’s aloof, mysterious, and evocative half-sister, to whom Henry is irresistibly drawn. Slowly, agonizingly, these deeply-flawed, profoundly human characters pull Henry and Effie out of themselves and expose them to a side of desire they never expected.<br /><br />While they discover new truths in each other and in their marriage, the empty beach town becomes their playground. And as they sneak into the vacant summer homes, go sailing, walk naked under the stars, make love, and drink an enormous amount of gin, Henry and Effie slip from innocence into betrayal, with irrevocable consequences.<br /><br />Seductive and moving, this is a novel about marriage, love, raw sexuality, and the ways in which desire and betrayal can reverberate endlessly throughout our lives.",3.00,256,Paperback, ,49,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44034479-cape-may,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44034479-cape-may

The time and circumstances in which they were raised often shapes them—yet a few leaders have managed to shape their times. In <em>What You Do Is Who You Are,</em> he turns his attention to a question crucial to every organization: how do you create and sustain the culture you want?<br /><br />To Horowitz, culture is how a company makes decisions. It is the set of assumptions employees use to resolve everyday problems: should I stay at the Red Roof Inn, or the Four Seasons? Should we discuss the color of this product for five minutes or thirty hours? If culture is not purposeful, it will be an accident or a mistake.<br /><br /><em>What You Do Is Who You Are</em> explains how to make your culture purposeful by spotlighting four models of leadership and culture-building—the leader of the only successful slave revolt, Haiti’s Toussaint Louverture; the Samurai, who ruled Japan for seven hundred years and shaped modern Japanese culture; Genghis Khan, who built the world’s largest empire; and Shaka Senghor, a man convicted of murder who ran the most formidable prison gang in the yard and ultimately transformed prison culture.<br /><br />Horowitz connects these leadership examples to modern case-studies, including how Louverture’s cultural techniques were applied (or should have been) by Reed Hastings at Netflix, Travis Kalanick at Uber, and Hillary Clinton, and how Genghis Khan’s vision of cultural inclusiveness has parallels in the work of Don Thompson, the first African-American CEO of McDonalds, and of Maggie Wilderotter, the CEO who led Frontier Communications. Horowitz then offers guidance to help any company understand its own strategy and build a successful culture.<br /><br /><em>What You Do Is Who You Are</em> is a journey through culture, from ancient to modern. Along the way, it answers a question fundamental to any organization: who are we? How do people talk about us when we’re not around? How do we treat our customers? Are we there for people in a pinch? Can we be trusted?<br /><br />Who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It’s not what you say in company-wide meeting. It’s not your marketing campaign. It’s not even what you believe. Who you are is <em>what you do</em>.

  <strong>Mitch Albom has done it again with this moving memoir of love and loss. You can’t help but fall for Chika. A page-turner that will no doubt become a classic.” --Mary Karr, author of <em>The Liars’ Club</em> and <em>The Art of Memoir</em></strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>From the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Tuesdays With Morrie</em> comes Mitch Albom’s most personal story to date: an intimate and heartwarming memoir about what it means to be a family and the young Haitian orphan whose short life would forever change his heart. </strong>
</p><p>Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in a landscape of extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to The Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Albom operates in Port Au Prince.<br /> <br /> With no children of their own, the forty-plus children who live, play, and go to school at the orphanage have become family to Mitch and his wife, Janine. Chika’s arrival makes a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delights the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika is suddenly diagnosed with something a doctor there says, “No one in Haiti can help you with.”<br /> <br /> Mitch and Janine bring Chika to Detroit, hopeful that American medical care can soon return her to her homeland. Instead, Chika becomes a permanent part of their household, and their lives, as they embark on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika’s boundless optimism and humor teach Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learns that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost.<br /> <br /> Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable. Finding Chika is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed—a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.</p>",4.45,256,Kindle Edition, ,1733,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44072106-finding-chika,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44072106-finding-chika

Now, as old family secrets and new ones threaten to derail her new royal life, Bex has to face the emotional wreckage she and Nick left behind: with the Queen, with the world, and with Nick’s brother Freddie, whose sins may not be so easily forgotten — nor forgiven.",3.88,464,ebook, ,536,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44132049-the-heir-affair,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44132049-the-heir-affair

Equal parts theory, training manual, expose, and memoir, Practice and All is Coming ... is a foray into the difficult topics of personal agency, spirituality authority, and cult dynamics. In addition to his clearly articulated understanding of the problems inherent in many spiritual schools, Mathew provides hope for healing the confusion and anguish that arise in the heart of sincere practitioners when they are betrayed by the revered powers in which they have placed their trust. If you practice or teach yoga, please consider this book an essential companion on your path.<br /><br />Christina Sell, author of Yoga From the Inside Out, My Body is a Temple, and A Deeper Yoga.<br /><br />This text is a formidable contribution and necessary, painstaking collaboration that took incredible courage and fortitude to bring to light. It plays a critical role in allowing yoga to move forward in our generation and the next, to reframe what it means to practice yoga, and how. It encourages our yoga community to begin to move out of the darkness of its history of sexual assault, self-harm, and guru as god worship, and into the light toward healing. To enforce a no tolerance policy against sexual abuse and psychological and spiritual manipulation that can end generations of violence against women, men, &amp; the self with our collective, informed, and compassionate will.<br /><br />As a sexual assault survivor, it took me years, almost 2 decades, to move from victim to victor. This text was the hardest thing I've ever had to read. But, it was also one of the most important. ... Many times while reading, my body and mind viscerally pushed back against reading, my throat tightened, threatening to close; and the anger, so old now it has turned to grief, begin to rise up and threaten to make me mourn all over again. Mourn for justice that, just like for the women in this book, will never formally be awarded.<br /><br />The healing potential of this book lies in an equal two parts-one part admission and revelation and one part evolution-the demand for evolution in order to nurture healing and recovery toward ending abuse, coercion, violence, injury, and deceptive manipulation in yoga. Yoga should be about healing, not harm.<br /><br />Dr. Ginger Garner, DPT, ATC/L, PYT, author, Medical Therapeutic Yoga<br /><br />An utterly shocking expos� of the fascinating, messy relationships between yoga, narcissism, systems of control, and charismatic leadership. The author usefully synthesizes Attachment Theory and current research on cult dynamics, cutting through the gauzy mystique of the yoga industry with a strong analysis of power, rank, and privilege. Both sensitive and searing, Remski's critique is a tour de force that provides a much-needed public health service to yoga practitioners and teachers alike.<br /><br />Carmen Spagnola, Somatic Trauma Recovery Practitioner and host of The Numinous Podcast.",4.48,366,Paperback, ,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44139117-practice-and-all-is-coming,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44139117-practice-and-all-is-coming

  </b>
  <b>, a deeply immersive chronicle of how the optimistic entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley set out to create a free and democratic internet—and how the cynical propagandists of the alt-right exploited that freedom to propel the extreme into the mainstream. </b>
</b><br /><br />For several years, Andrew Marantz, a<i> New Yorker</i> staff writer, has been embedded in two worlds. The first is the world of social-media entrepreneurs, who, acting out of naïvete and reckless ambition, upended all traditional means of receiving and transmitting information. The second is the world of the people he calls ""the gate crashers""—the conspiracists, white supremacists, and nihilist trolls who have become experts at using social media to advance their corrosive agenda. <i>Antisocial</i> ranges broadly—from the first mass-printed books to the trending hashtags of the present; from secret gatherings of neo-Fascists to the White House press briefing room—and traces how the unthinkable becomes thinkable, and then how it becomes reality. Combining the keen narrative detail of Bill Buford's <i>Among the Thugs </i>and the sweep of George Packer's <i>The Unwinding</i>, <i> Antisocial</i> reveals how the boundaries between technology, media, and politics have been erased, resulting in a deeply broken informational landscape—the landscape in which we all now live. Marantz shows how alienated young people are led down the rabbit hole of online radicalization, and how fringe ideas spread—from anonymous corners of social media to cable TV to the President's Twitter feed. Marantz also sits with the creators of social media as they start to reckon with the forces they've unleashed. Will they be able to solve the communication crisis they helped bring about, or are their interventions too little too late?",4.25,400,Hardcover, ,234,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44139381-antisocial,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44139381-antisocial

Through close studies of sixteen modern classics, musicologist Nate Sloan and songwriter Charlie Harding shift pop from the background to the foreground, illuminating the essential musical concepts behind two decades of chart-topping songs.<br /><br />In 1939, Aaron Copland published <em>What to Listen for in Music</em>, the bestseller that made classical music approachable for generations of listeners. Eighty years later, Nate and Charlie update Copland's idea for a new audience and repertoire: 21st century pop, from Britney to Beyonc�, Outkast to Kendrick Lamar. Despite the importance of pop music in contemporary culture, most discourse only revolves around lyrics and celebrity. <em>Switched on Pop</em> gives readers the tools they need to interpret our modern soundtrack. Each chapter investigates a different song and artist, revealing musical insights such as how a single melodic motif follows Taylor Swift through every genre that she samples, Andr� 3000 uses metric manipulation to get listeners to ""shake it like a Polaroid picture,"" or Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee create harmonic ambiguity in ""Despacito"" that mirrors the patterns of global migration.<br /><br />Replete with engaging discussions and eye-catching illustrations, <em>Switched on Pop</em> brings to life the musical qualities that catapult songs into the pop pantheon. Readers will find themselves listening to familiar tracks in new waysand not just those from the Top 40. The timeless concepts that Nate and Charlie define can be applied to any musical style. From fanatics to skeptics, teenagers to octogenarians, non-musicians to professional composers, every music lover will discover something ear-opening in <em>Switched on Pop</em>.<br />",4.04,224,Hardcover, ,44,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44244893-switched-on-pop,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44244893-switched-on-pop

Hardy liberates us from the limiting belief that our ""true selves"" are to be discovered, and shows how we can intentionally create our desired selves and achieve amazing goals instead. He offers practical, science-based advice to for personal-reinvention, including: <br /><br /><br />- Why personality tests such as Myers-Briggs and Enneagram are not only psychologically destructive but are no more scientific than horoscopes <br /> - Why you should never be the ""former"" anything--because defining yourself by your past successes is just as damaging to growth as being haunted by past failures <br /> - How to design your current identity based on your desired future self and make decisions here-and-now through your new identity <br /> - How to reframe traumatic and painful experiences into a fresh narrative supporting your future success <br /> - How to become confident enough to define your own life's purpose <br /> - How to create a network of ""empathetic witnesses"" who actively encourage you through the highs and lows of extreme growth <br /> - How to enhance your subconscious to overcome addictions and limiting patterns <br /> - How redesign your environment to pull you toward your future, rather than keep you stuck in the past <br /> - How to tap into what psychologists call ""pull motivation"" by narrowing your focus on a single, definable, and compelling outcome<br /><br />The book includes true stories of intentional self-transformation--such as Vanessa O'Brien, who quit her corporate job and set the Guinness World Record for a woman climbing the highest peak on every continent in the fastest time; Andre Norman, who became a Harvard fellow after serving a fourteen-year prison sentence; Ken Arlen, who instantly quit smoking by changing his identity narrative; and Hardy himself, who transcended his childhood in a broken home, surrounded by issues of addiction and mental illness, to earn his PhD and build a happy family.<br /><br />Filled with strategies for reframing your past and designing your future, <i>Personality Isn't Permanent</i> is a guide to breaking free from the past and becoming the person you want to be.",4.25,272,Kindle Edition, ,74,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279312-personality-isn-t-permanent,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279312-personality-isn-t-permanent

To the extent possible, he has made a science of understanding how the US economy works almost as a living organism--how it grows and changes, surges and stalls. He has made a particular study of the question of productivity growth, at the heart of which is the riddle of innovation. Where does innovation come from, and how does it spread through a society? And why do some eras see the fruits of innovation spread more democratically, and others, including our own, see the opposite?<br /><br />In <i>Capitalism in America</i>, Greenspan distills a lifetime of grappling with these questions into a thrilling and profound master reckoning with the decisive drivers of the US economy over the course of its history. In partnership with the celebrated Economist journalist and historian Adrian Wooldridge, he unfolds a tale involving vast landscapes, titanic figures, triumphant breakthroughs, enlightenment ideals as well as terrible moral failings. Every crucial debate is here--from the role of slavery in the antebellum Southern economy to the real impact of FDR's New Deal to America's violent mood swings in its openness to global trade and its impact. But to read <i>Capitalism in America</i> is above all to be stirred deeply by the extraordinary productive energies unleashed by millions of ordinary Americans that have driven this country to unprecedented heights of power and prosperity.<br /><br />At heart, the authors argue, America's genius has been its unique tolerance for the effects of creative destruction, the ceaseless churn of the old giving way to the new, driven by new people and new ideas. Often messy and painful, creative destruction has also lifted almost all Americans to standards of living unimaginable to even the wealthiest citizens of the world a few generations past. A sense of justice and human decency demands that those who bear the brunt of the pain of change be protected, but America has always accepted more pain for more gain, and its vaunted rise cannot otherwise be understood, or its challenges faced, without recognizing this legacy. For now, in our time, productivity growth has stalled again, stirring up the populist furies. There's no better moment to apply the lessons of history to the most pressing question we face, that of whether the United States will preserve its preeminence, or see its leadership pass to other, inevitably less democratic powers.",4.11,496,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279924-capitalism-in-america,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279924-capitalism-in-america

Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), <i>City of Girls</i> explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.<br /><br />In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.<br /><br />Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. ""At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,"" she muses. ""After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is."" Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, <i>City of Girls</i> is a love story like no other.",4.04, ,Audible Audio, ,184,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44288527-city-of-girls,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44288527-city-of-girls

Comedy legends and A-list actors. Supermodels and centerfolds. Moguls and mobsters. A president.<br /><br />Over his unrivaled four-decade career in radio, Howard Stern has interviewed thousands of personalities—discussing sex, relationships, money, fame, spirituality, and success with the boldest of bold-faced names. But which interviews are his favorites? It’s one of the questions he gets asked most frequently. Howard Stern Comes Again delivers his answer.<br /><br />This book is a feast of conversation and more, as between the lines Stern offers his definitive autobiography—a magnum opus of confession and personal exploration. Tracy Morgan opens up about his near-fatal car crash. Lady Gaga divulges her history with cocaine. Madonna reminisces on her relationship with Tupac Shakur. Bill Murray waxes philosophical on the purpose of life. Jerry Seinfeld offers a master class on comedy. Harvey Weinstein denies the existence of the so-called casting couch. An impressive array of creative visionaries weigh in on what Stern calls “the climb”—the stories of how they struggled and eventually prevailed. As he writes in the introduction, “If you’re having trouble finding motivation in life and you’re looking for that extra kick in the ass, you will find it in these pages.”<br /><br />Interspersed throughout are rare selections from the Howard Stern Show archives with Donald Trump that depict his own climb: transforming from Manhattan tabloid fixture to reality TV star to president of the United States. Stern also tells of his Moby Dick-like quest to land an interview with Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 election—one of many newly written revelations from the author. He speaks with extraordinary candor about a variety of subjects, including his overwhelming insecurity early in his career, his revolutionary move from terrestrial radio to SiriusXM, and his belief in the power of psychotherapy.<br /><br />As Stern insightfully notes in the introduction: “The interviews collected here represent my best work and show my personal evolution. But they don’t just show my evolution. Gathered together like this, they show the evolution of popular culture over the past quarter century.”",4.04,549,Kindle Edition, ,519,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44414972-howard-stern-comes-again,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44414972-howard-stern-comes-again

La irrupción de vampiros, de criaturas poseídas y de espíritus, que conviven con personajes y situaciones entrañables de la vida cotidiana, muda los relatos en originalísimas variantes sobre la inagotable materia de la enfermedad, la vejez y la muerte, a la vez que suponen una tenaz defensa de valores como el derecho a la diferencia y la libertad individual, y una aguerrida vindicación de las mujeres en un entorno hostil.<br /><br />Así, una escritora de literatura fantástica que ha enviudado hace poco sobrevive a una tormentosa noche de invierno guiada por la voz de su difunto marido; una anciana aquejada por el síndrome de Charles Bonnet asume la presencia de enanitos imaginarios mientras una turba disfrazada con caretas se congrega ante la residencia de la tercera edad donde vive para asaltar el recinto y prenderle fuego; o una sedimentación fosilizada con mil novecientos millones de años de antigüedad venga un delito cometido tiempo atrás.<br /><br />Salpicados de momentos estremecedores, estos divertidos relatos que invitan a la reflexión confirman a la autora canadiense como una incisiva cronista de nuestros impulsos más oscuros.

Morale had deteriorated, competition was more intense, and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company's history. ""I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past,"" Iger writes. ""The only thing that mattered was the future, and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go."" It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.<br /><br />Twelve years later, Disney is the largest, most respected media company in the world counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time.<br /><br />Now, he's sharing the lessons he's learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It's also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving <i>Star Wars</i> myth.<br /><br />""Over the past fourteen years, I think I've learned so much about what real leadership is,"" Iger writes.

  <b>From the two-time Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter behind the groundbreaking album </b>

    <i>Exile in Guyville</i>

  <b> comes a haunting memoir in stories in the tradition of Patti Smith's </b>
  <b>
    <i>M Train</i>
  </b>
</b><br /><br />When Liz Phair was just starting out in the Wicker Park, Chicago, music scene in the early 1990s, she mostly encountered a**holes—mostly men, who didn't respect her and were determined not to see her fail, exactly, because they didn't care enough about her to wish failure on her—they just wanted her to get out of their space, to <i>disappear</i>. ""Girly Sound"" was the name of the cassettes she used to pass around in those days, and in 1993 those songs became the landmark album <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, which turned Phair, at twenty-five, into a foul-mouthed feminist icon.<br /><br />Now, like a Gen X Patti Smith, Liz Phair tells the story of her life and career in a memoir about the moments that have haunted her most. Horror is in the eye of the beholder. For Phair, horror is what stays with you—the often unrecognized, universal experiences of daily pain, shame, and fear that make up our common humanity. In Phair's case it means the dangers of falling for ""the perfect guy,"" and the disaster that awaits her; the memory of a stranger passed out on a bathroom floor amid a crowd of girls, forcing her to consider our responsibilities to one another, and the gnawing regret of being a bystander; and the profound sense of emptiness she experienced on the set of her first celebrity photoshoot.<br /><br /><i>Horror Stories </i>reads like the confessions of a friend, a book that gathers up all of our isolated shames, bringing us together in our shared imperfection, our uncertainty and our cowardice, smashing the stigma of not being in control. But most importantly, <i>Horror Stories</i> is a memoir that asks questions of how we feel about the things that have happened to us, how we cope with regret and culpability, and how we break the spell of those things, leeching them of their power over us. This memoir is an immersive experience, taking readers inside the most intimate moments of Phair's life. Her fearless prose, wit, and uncompromising honesty transform those deeply personal moments into tales about each and every one of us—that will appeal to both the serious fan and the serious reader.",3.70,261,Hardcover, ,341,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525549-horror-stories,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525549-horror-stories

In <i>Brooklyn: The Once and Future City</i>, Thomas J. Campanella unearths long-lost threads of the urban past, telling the rich history of the rise, fall, and reinvention of one of the world's most resurgent cities.<br /><br />Spanning centuries and neighborhoods, Brooklyn-born Campanella recounts the creation of places familiar and long forgotten, both built and never realized, bringing to life the individuals whose dreams, visions, rackets, and schemes forged the city we know today. He takes us through Brooklyn's history as homeland of the Leni Lenape and its transformation by Dutch colonists into a dense slaveholding region. We learn about English �migr� Deborah Moody, whose town of Gravesend was the first founded by a woman in America. We see how wanderlusting Yale dropout Frederick Law Olmsted used Prospect Park to anchor an open space system that was to reach back to Manhattan. And we witness Brooklyn's emergence as a playland of racetracks and amusement parks celebrated around the world.<br /><br />Campanella also describes Brooklyn's outsized failures, from Samuel Friede's bid to erect the world's tallest building to the long struggle to make Jamaica Bay the world's largest deepwater seaport, and the star-crossed urban renewal, public housing, and highway projects that battered the borough in the postwar era. Campanella reveals how this immigrant Promised Land drew millions, fell victim to its own social anxieties, and yet proved resilient enough to reawaken as a multicultural powerhouse and global symbol of urban vitality.",3.88,552,Hardcover, ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525993-brooklyn,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44525993-brooklyn

Buckley Jr., a fierce critic of the movement and America's most influential conservative intellectual. The topic was ""the American dream is at the expense of the American Negro,"" and no one who has seen the debate can soon forget it. Nicholas Buccola's <i>The Fire Is upon Us</i> is the first book to tell the full story of the event, the radically different paths that led Baldwin and Buckley to it, the controversies that followed, and how the debate and the decades-long clash between the men continues to illuminate America's racial divide today.<br /><br />Born in New York City only fifteen months apart, the Harlem-raised Baldwin and the privileged Buckley could not have been more different, but they both rose to the height of American intellectual life during the civil rights movement. By the time they met in Cambridge, Buckley was determined to sound the alarm about a man he considered an ""eloquent menace."" For his part, Baldwin viewed Buckley as a deluded reactionary whose popularity revealed the sickness of the American soul. The stage was set for an epic confrontation that pitted Baldwin's call for a moral revolution in race relations against Buckley's unabashed elitism and implicit commitment to white supremacy.<br /><br />A remarkable story of race and the American dream, <i>The Fire Is upon Us </i>reveals the deep roots and lasting legacy of a conflict that continues to haunt our politics.",4.54,496,Hardcover, ,82,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44526014-the-fire-is-upon-us,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44526014-the-fire-is-upon-us

  <strong>From the New York Times bestselling author of The Family Fang, a moving and uproarious novel about a woman who finds meaning in her life when she begins caring for two children with a remarkable ability.</strong>
</p><p>Lillian and Madison were unlikely roommates and yet inseparable friends at their elite boarding school. But then Lillian had to leave the school unexpectedly in the wake of a scandal and they’ve barely spoken since. Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help.</p><p>Madison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker. However, there’s a catch: the twins spontaneously combust when they get agitated, flames igniting from their skin in a startling but beautiful way. Lillian is convinced Madison is pulling her leg, but it’s the truth.</p><p>Thinking of her dead-end life at home, the life that has consistently disappointed her, Lillian figures she has nothing to lose. Over the course of one humid, demanding summer, Lillian and the twins learn to trust each other—and stay cool—while also staying out of the way of Madison’s buttoned-up politician husband. Surprised by her own ingenuity yet unused to the intense feelings of protectiveness she feels for them, Lillian ultimately begins to accept that she needs these strange children as much as they need her—urgently and fiercely. Couldn’t this be the start of the amazing life she’d always hoped for?</p><p>With white-hot wit and a big, tender heart, Kevin Wilson has written his best book yet—a most unusual story of parental love.</p>",3.94,272,Kindle Edition, ,879,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44527740-nothing-to-see-here,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44527740-nothing-to-see-here

As Yunus struggles to hold on to his sanity and evade Saeed’s increasingly undeniable accusations, he must eventually make an impossible choice: continue fighting or submit to the system of lies upholding Iran’s power.<br /><br />Gripping, startling, and masterfully told, <em>Then the Fish Swallowed Him</em> is a haunting story of life under despotism.",3.58,288,ebook, ,35,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44557426-then-the-fish-swallowed-him,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44557426-then-the-fish-swallowed-him

  <strong>Ann Patchett, the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Commonwealth,</em> delivers her most powerful novel to date: a richly moving story that explores the indelible bond between two siblings, the house of their childhood, and a past that will not let them go. <em>The Dutch House</em> is the story of a paradise lost, a tour de force that digs deeply into questions of inheritance, love and forgiveness, of how we want to see ourselves and of who we really are.</strong>
</p><p>At the end of the Second World War, Cyril Conroy combines luck and a single canny investment to begin an enormous real estate empire, propelling his family from poverty to enormous wealth. His first order of business is to buy the Dutch House, a lavish estate in the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Meant as a surprise for his wife, the house sets in motion the undoing of everyone he loves.</p><p>The story is told by Cyril’s son Danny, as he and his older sister, the brilliantly acerbic and self-assured Maeve, are exiled from the house where they grew up by their stepmother. The two wealthy siblings are thrown back into the poverty their parents had escaped from and find that all they have to count on is one another. It is this unshakeable bond between them that both saves their lives and thwarts their futures.</p> <p>Set over the course of five decades, <em>The Dutch House</em> is a dark fairy tale about two smart people who cannot overcome their past. Despite every outward sign of success, Danny and Maeve are only truly comfortable when they’re together. Throughout their lives they return to the well-worn story of what they’ve lost with humor and rage. But when at last they’re forced to confront the people who left them behind, the relationship between an indulged brother and his ever-protective sister is finally tested.</p>",4.12,353,Kindle Edition, ,1841,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44569767-the-dutch-house,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44569767-the-dutch-house

W. Norton  Company,eng,false,"In June 2017, Travis Kalanick, the hard-charging CEO of Uber, was ousted in a boardroom coup that capped a brutal year for the transportation giant. Uber had catapulted to the top of the tech world, yet for many came to symbolize everything wrong with Silicon Valley.<br /><br /><br />Award-winning <em>New York Times</em> technology correspondent Mike Isaac’s <em>Super Pumped</em> presents the dramatic rise and fall of Uber, set against an era of rapid upheaval in Silicon Valley. Backed by billions in venture capital dollars and led by a brash and ambitious founder, Uber promised to revolutionize the way we move people and goods through the world. A near instant “unicorn,” Uber seemed poised to take its place next to Amazon, Apple, and Google as a technology giant.<br /><br /><br />What followed would become a corporate cautionary tale about the perils of startup culture and a vivid example of how blind worship of startup founders can go wildly wrong. Isaac recounts Uber’s pitched battles with taxi unions and drivers, the company’s toxic internal culture, and the bare-knuckle tactics it devised to overcome obstacles in its quest for dominance. With billions of dollars at stake, Isaac shows how venture capitalists asserted their power and seized control of the startup as it fought its way toward its fateful IPO.<br /><br /><br />Based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Uber employees, along with previously unpublished documents, <em>Super Pumped</em> is a page-turning story of ambition and deception, obscene wealth, and bad behavior that explores how blistering technological and financial innovation culminated in one of the most catastrophic twelve-month periods in American corporate history.",4.16,387,Hardcover, ,518,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44573628-super-pumped,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44573628-super-pumped

  <strong>A mayor’s inspirational story of a Midwest city that has become nothing less than a blueprint for the future of American renewal.</strong>
</p><br /><p>Once described by the <em>Washington Post</em> as “the most interesting mayor you’ve never heard of,” Pete Buttigieg, the thirty-six-year-old Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has improbably emerged as one of the nation’s most visionary politicians. First elected in 2011, Buttigieg left a successful business career to move back to his hometown, previously tagged by Newsweek as a “dying city,” because the industrial Midwest beckoned as a challenge to the McKinsey-trained Harvard graduate. Whether meeting with city residents on middle-school basketball courts, reclaiming abandoned houses, confronting gun violence, or attracting high-tech industry, Buttigieg has transformed South Bend into a shining model of urban reinvention.</p><br /><p>While Washington reels with scandal, <em>Shortest Way Home</em> interweaves two once-unthinkable success stories: that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a Rust Belt city so thoroughly transformed that it shatters the way we view America’s so-called flyover country.</p>",4.21,347,Kindle Edition, ,173,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44578892-shortest-way-home,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44578892-shortest-way-home

He had a front-row seat as they elevated pop music into an art form, and he was present at the creation of some of the most iconic music of our times.<br /><br />Asher is also a talented musician in his own right, with a great ear for what was new and fresh. Once, when Paul McCartney wrote a song that John Lennon didn’t think was right for the Beatles, Asher asked if he could record it. “A World Without Love” became a global No. 1 hit for his duo, Peter &amp; Gordon. A few years later Asher was asked by Paul McCartney to help start Apple Records; the first artist Asher discovered and signed up was a young American singer-songwriter named James Taylor. Before long he would be not only managing and producing Taylor but also (having left Apple and moved to Los Angeles) working with Linda Ronstadt, Neil Diamond, Robin Williams, Joni Mitchell, and Cher, among others.<br /><br /><i>The Beatles from A to Zed </i>grows out of his popular radio program “From Me to You” on SiriusXM's The Beatles Channel, where he shares memories and insights about the Fab Four and their music. Here he weaves his reflections into a whimsical alphabetical journey that focuses not only on songs whose titles start with each letter, but also on recurrent themes in the Beatles’ music, the instruments they played, the innovations they pioneered, the artists who influenced them, the key people in their lives, and the cultural events of the time.<br /><br />Few can match Peter Asher for his fresh and personal perspective on the Beatles.

  <strong>A <em>New York Times</em> technology correspondent presents the dramatic story of Uber, the Silicon Valley startup at the center of one of the great venture capital power struggles of our time.</strong>
</p><br /><p>In June 2017, Travis Kalanick, the hard-charging CEO of Uber, was ousted in a boardroom coup that capped a brutal year for the transportation giant. Uber had catapulted to the top of the tech world, yet for many came to symbolize everything wrong with Silicon Valley.</p><br /><p>Award-winning <em>New York Times</em> technology correspondent Mike Isaac’s <em>Super Pumped</em> presents the dramatic rise and fall of Uber, set against an era of rapid upheaval in Silicon Valley. Backed by billions in venture capital dollars and led by a brash and ambitious founder, Uber promised to revolutionize the way we move people and goods through the world. A near instant “unicorn,” Uber seemed poised to take its place next to Amazon, Apple, and Google as a technology giant.</p><br /><p>What followed would become a corporate cautionary tale about the perils of startup culture and a vivid example of how blind worship of startup founders can go wildly wrong. Isaac recounts Uber’s pitched battles with taxi unions and drivers, the company’s toxic internal culture, and the bare-knuckle tactics it devised to overcome obstacles in its quest for dominance. With billions of dollars at stake, Isaac shows how venture capitalists asserted their power and seized control of the startup as it fought its way toward its fateful IPO.</p><br /><p>Based on hundreds of interviews with current and former Uber employees, along with previously unpublished documents, <em>Super Pumped</em> is a page-turning story of ambition and deception, obscene wealth, and bad behavior that explores how blistering technological and financial innovation culminated in one of the most catastrophic twelve-month periods in American corporate history.</p>",4.16,410,Kindle Edition, ,101,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44599442-super-pumped,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44599442-super-pumped

You won’t be able to stop thinking about it and talking about it. </b><br /><br />In the fall of 2016, acclaimed author Meghan Daum began working on a book about the excesses of contemporary feminism. With Hillary Clinton soon to be elected, she figured even the most fiercely liberal of her friends and readers could take the criticisms in stride. But after the election, she knew she needed to do more, and her nearly completed manuscript went in the trash. What came out in its place is the most sharply-observed, all-encompassing, and unputdownable book of her career.<br /> <br />In this gripping new work, Meghan examines our country’s most intractable problems with clear-eyed honesty instead of exaggerated outrage. With passion, humor, and most importantly nuance, she tries to make sense of the current landscape—from Donald Trump’s presidency to the #MeToo movement and beyond. In the process, she wades into the waters of identity politics and intersectionality, thinks deeply about the gender wage gap, and tests a theory about the divide between Gen Xers and millennials.<br /> <br />This signature work may well be the first book to capture the essence of this era in all its nuances and contradictions.

Founded by her grandfather and consisting almost entirely of her extended family, the tiny group would gain worldwide notoriety for its pickets at military funerals and celebrations of death and tragedy. As Phelps-Roper grew up, she saw that church members were close companions and accomplished debaters, applying the logic of predestination and the language of the King James Bible to everyday life with aplomb—which, as the church’s Twitter spokeswoman, she learned to do with great skill. Soon, however, dialogue on Twitter caused her to begin doubting the church’s leaders and message: If humans were sinful and fallible, how could the church itself be so confident about its beliefs? As she digitally jousted with critics, she started to wonder if sometimes they had a point—and then she began exchanging messages with a man who would help change her life.</p><p>A gripping memoir of escaping extremism and falling in love, <i>Unfollow</i> relates Phelps-Roper’s moral awakening, her departure from the church, and how she exchanged the absolutes she grew up with for new forms of warmth and community.

""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br /><br />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br /><br />There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.

After years of slowly overtaking the continent, starting with the great coastal cities, rising floodwaters have left America an archipelago of mountaintop colonies surrounded by a deep expanse of open water. Civilization as it once was is gone. Bands of pirates roam the waters, in search of goods and women to breed. Some join together to create a new kind of society, while others sail alone, barely surviving.<br /><br />Stubbornly independent Myra and her precocious and feisty eight-year-old daughter, Pearl, fish from their small boat, the Bird, visiting small hamlets and towns on dry land only to trade for supplies and information. Just before Pearl’s birth, when the monstrous deluge overtook their home in Nebraska, Maya’s oldest daughter, Row, was stolen by her father.<br /><br />For eight years Myra has searched for the girl that she knows, in her bones and her heart, still lives. In a violent confrontation with a stranger, Myra discovers that Row was last seen in a far-off encampment of raiders on the coast of what used to be Greenland. Throwing aside her usual caution, she and Pearl embark on a perilous voyage into the icy northern seas to rescue the girl, now thirteen.<br /><br />On the journey, Myra and Pearl join forces with a larger ship, a band of Americans like them. In a desperate act of deceit and manipulation, Myra convinces the crew to sail north. Though she hides her true motivations, Myra finds herself bonding with her fellow seekers, men, women, and children who hope to build a safe haven together in this dangerous new world.<br /><br />But secrets, lust, and betrayals threaten to capsize their dream, and after their fortunes take a shocking—and bloody—turn, Myra can no longer ignore the question of whether saving Row is worth endangering Pearl and her fellow travelers.<br /><br />A compulsively readable novel of dark despair and soaring hope, <em>After the Flood</em> is a magnificent, action-packed, and sometimes frightening odyssey laced with wonder—an affecting and wholly original saga both redemptive and astonishing.",3.70,432,Kindle Edition, ,244,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44705371-after-the-flood,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44705371-after-the-flood

Now, based on hard-earned personal experiences, as well as knowledge and wisdom earned through decades of work with the grieving, Kessler introduces a critical sixth stage.<br /> <br /> Many people look for “closure” after a loss. Kessler argues that it’s finding meaning beyond the stages of grief most of us are familiar with—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—that can transform grief into a more peaceful and hopeful experience.<br /> <br /> In this book, Kessler gives readers a roadmap to remembering those who have died with more love than pain; he shows us how to move forward in a way that honors our loved ones. Kessler’s insight is both professional and intensely personal. His journey with grief began when, as a child, he witnessed a mass shooting at the same time his mother was dying. For most of his life, Kessler taught physicians, nurses, counselors, police, and first responders about end of life, trauma, and grief, as well as leading talks and retreats for those experiencing grief. Despite his knowledge, his life was upended by the sudden death of his twenty-one-year-old son.<br /> <br />How does the grief expert handle such a tragic loss? He knew he had to find a way through this unexpected, devastating loss, a way that would honor his son. That, ultimately, was the sixth state of grief—meaning. In <i>Finding Meaning</i>, Kessler shares the insights, collective wisdom, and powerful tools that will help those experiencing loss.<br /> <br /> <i>Finding Meaning </i>is a necessary addition to grief literature and a vital guide to healing from tremendous loss. This is an inspiring, deeply intelligent must-read for anyone looking to journey away from suffering, through loss, and towards meaning.",4.41,224,Kindle Edition, ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44719438-finding-meaning,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44719438-finding-meaning

For months Kantor and Twohey had been having confidential discussions with top actresses, former Weinstein employees and other sources, learning of disturbing long-buried allegations, some of which had been covered up by onerous legal settlements. The journalists meticulously picked their way through a web of decades-old secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements, pressed some of the most famous women in the world--and some unknown ones--to risk going on the record, and faced down Weinstein, his team of high-priced defenders, and even his private investigators. <br /><br />But nothing could have prepared them for what followed the publication of their Weinstein story. Within days, a veritable Pandora's Box of sexual harassment and abuse was opened, and women who had suffered in silence for generations began coming forward, trusting that the world would understand their stories. Over the next twelve months, hundreds of men from every walk of life and industry would be outed for mistreating their colleagues. But did too much change--or not enough? Those questions plunged the two journalists into a new phase of reporting and some of their most startling findings yet. <br /><br />With superlative detail, insight, and journalistic expertise, Kantor and Twohey take us for the first time into the very heart of this social shift, reliving in real-time what it took to get the story and giving an up-close portrait of the forces that hindered and spurred change. They describe the surprising journeys of those who spoke up--for the sake of other women, for future generations, and for themselves--and so changed us all.",4.38,310,Hardcover, ,2244,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767249-she-said,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767249-she-said

Most philosophers believe that our experience is locked inside our skulls, an unreliable representation of a quite different reality outside. Color, smell, and sound, they tell us, occur only in our heads. Yet when neuroscientists look inside our brains to see what’s going on, they find only billions of neurons exchanging electrical impulses and releasing chemical substances.<br /><br />Five years ago, in a chance conversation, Tim Parks came across a radical new theory of consciousness that undercut this interpretation. It set him off on a quest to discover more about this fascinating topic and also led him to observe his own experience with immense attention.<br /><br /><em>Out of My Head</em> tells the gripping, highly personal, often surprisingly funny story of Parks’s quest to discover more about this fascinating topic. It frames complex metaphysical considerations and technical laboratory experiments in terms we can all understand.

Unfettered by logic or time, she draws us into her private wonderland with no design, yet heeding signs–including a talking sign that looms above her, prodding and sparring like the Cheshire Cat. In February, a surreal lunar year begins, bringing with it unexpected turns, heightened mischief, and inescapable sorrow. In a stranger’s words, “Anything is possible: after all, it’s the Year of the Monkey.” For Smith–inveterately curious, always exploring, tracking thoughts, writing–the year evolves as one of reckoning with the changes in life’s gyre: with loss, aging, and a dramatic shift in the political landscape of America. <br /><br />Smith melds the western landscape with her own dreamscape. Taking us from California to the Arizona desert; to a Kentucky farm as the amanuensis of a friend in crisis; to the hospital room of a valued mentor; and by turns to remembered and imagined places, this haunting memoir blends fact and fiction with poetic mastery.

But his stage material highlighting his South Asian culture only served to mask the insecurities borne from his family history. Sure, Deb knew the facts: his parents, both Indian, separately immigrated to North America in the 1960s and 1970s. They were brought together in a volatile and ultimately doomed arranged marriage and raised a family in suburban New Jersey before his father returned to India alone.<br /><br />But Deb had never learned who his parents were as individuals—their ages, how many siblings they had, what they were like as children, what their favorite movies were. Theirs was an ostensibly nuclear family without any of the familial bonds. Coming of age in a mostly white suburban town, Deb’s alienation led him to seek separation from his family and his culture, longing for the tight-knit home environment of his white friends. His desire wasn’t rooted in racism or oppression; it was born of envy and desire—for white moms who made after-school snacks and asked his friends about the girls they liked and the teachers they didn’t. Deb yearned for the same.<br /><br />Deb’s experiences as one of the few minorities covering the Trump campaign, and subsequently as a stand up comedian, propelled him on a dramatic journey to India to see his father—the first step in a life altering journey to bridge the emotional distance separating him from those whose DNA he shared. Deb had to learn to connect with this man he recognized yet did not know—and eventually breach the silence separating him from his mother.

Till now, twenty-three-year-old Simon Boudlin has evaded military duty thanks to his slight stature, youthful appearance, and utter lack of compunction about bending the truth. But following a barroom brawl in Victoria, Texas, Simon finds himself conscripted, however belatedly, into the Confederate Army. Luckily his talent with a fiddle gets him a comparatively easy position in a regimental band.<br /><br />Weeks later, on the eve of the Confederate surrender, Simon and his bandmates are called to play for officers and their families from both sides of the conflict. There the quick-thinking, audacious fiddler can’t help but notice the lovely Doris Mary Dillon, an indentured girl from Ireland, who is governess to a Union colonel’s daughter.<br /><br />After the surrender, Simon and Doris go their separate ways. He will travel around Texas seeking fame and fortune as a musician. She must accompany the colonel’s family to finish her three years of service. But Simon cannot forget the fair Irish maiden, and vows that someday he will find her again.<br /><br />Incandescent in its beauty, told in Paulette Jiles’s trademark spare yet lilting style, <em>Simon the Fiddler</em> is a captivating, bittersweet tale of the chances a devoted man will take, and the lengths he will go to fulfill his heart’s yearning.",3.80,352,ebook, ,297,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44781457-simon-the-fiddler,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44781457-simon-the-fiddler

Maas launches her brand-new CRESCENT CITY series with House of Earth and Blood: the story of half-Fae and half-human Bryce Quinlan as she seeks revenge in a contemporary fantasy world of magic, danger, and searing romance.<br /><br />Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion—otherwise known as Crescent City— has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city—and Bryce’s world.<br /><br />Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city’s most notorious nightclubs. But when the murderer attacks again, Bryce finds herself dragged into the investigation and paired with an infamous Fallen angel whose own brutal past haunts his every step.<br /><br />Hunt Athalar, personal assassin for the Archangels, wants nothing to do with Bryce Quinlan, despite being ordered to protect her. She stands for everything he once rebelled against and seems more interested in partying than solving the murder, no matter how close to home it might hit. But Hunt soon realizes there’s far more to Bryce than meets the eye—and that he’s going to have to find a way to work with her if they want to solve this case.<br /><br />As Bryce and Hunt race to untangle the mystery, they have no way of knowing the threads they tug ripple through the underbelly of the city, across warring continents, and down to the darkest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir…<br /><br />With unforgettable characters and page-turning suspense, this richly inventive new fantasy series by #1 New York Times bestselling author Sarah J.

Continuing to address the mistaken notions about what children need to thrive in <em>Teach Your Children Well</em>, Levine tore down the myth that good grades, high test scores, and college acceptances should define the parenting endgame. In <em>Ready or Not,</em> she continues the discussion, showing how these same parenting practices, combined with a desperate need to shelter children from discomfort and anxiety, are setting future generations up to fail spectacularly.<br /><br />Increasingly, the world we know has become disturbing, unfamiliar, and even threatening. In the wake of uncertainty and rapid change, adults are doubling-down on the pressure-filled parenting style that pushes children to excel. Yet these daunting expectations, combined with the stress parents feel and unwittingly project onto their children, are leading to a generation of young people who are overwhelmed, exhausted, distressed—and unprepared for the future that awaits them. While these damaging effects are known, the world into which these children are coming of age is not. And continuing to focus primarily on grades and performance are leaving kids more ill-prepared than ever to navigate the challenges to come.<br /><br />But there is hope. Using the latest developments in neuroscience and epigenetics (the intersection of genetics and environment), as well as extensive research gleaned from captains of industry, entrepreneurs, military leaders, scientists, academics, and futurists, Levine identifies the skills that children need to succeed in a tumultuous future: adaptability, mental agility, curiosity, collaboration, tolerance for failure, resilience, and optimism. Most important, Levine offers day-to-day solutions parents can use to raise kids who are prepared, enthusiastic, and ready to face an unknown future with confidence and optimism.",3.85,288,Hardcover, ,26,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44890005-ready-or-not,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44890005-ready-or-not

The host of <i>Ask Science Mike</i> explains why our desires and our real lives are so wildly different—and what you can do to close the gap.</b><br /><br /> For thousands of years, scientists, philosophers, and self-help gurus have wrestled with one of the basic conundrums of human life: Why do we do the things we do? Or, rather, why do we so often <i>not </i>do the things we want to do? As a podcast host whose voice goes out to millions each month, Mike McHargue gets countless emails from people seeking to understand their own misbehavior—why we binge on Netflix when we know taking a walk outside would be better for us, or why we argue politics on Facebook when our real friends live just down the street. Everyone wants to be a good person, but few of us, twenty years into the new millennium, have any idea how to do that.<br /><br /> In <i>You’re a Miracle (and a Pain in the Ass),</i> McHargue addresses these issues. We like to think we’re in control of our thoughts and decisions, he writes, but science has shown that a host of competing impulses, emotions, and environmental factors are at play in every action we undertake. Touching on his podcast listeners’ most pressing questions, from relationships and ethics to stress and mental health, and sharing some of the biggest triumphs and hardships from his own life, McHargue shows us how some of our qualities that seem most frustrating—including “negative” emotions like sadness, anger, and anxiety—are actually key to helping humans survive and thrive. In doing so, he invites us on a path of self-understanding and, ultimately, self-acceptance.<br /><br /> <i> You’re a Miracle (and a Pain in the Ass)</i> is a guided tour through the mystery of human consciousness, showing readers how to live more at peace with themselves in a complex world.",4.29,256,Kindle Edition, ,7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45037816-you-re-a-miracle-and-a-pain-in-the-ass,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45037816-you-re-a-miracle-and-a-pain-in-the-ass

This is the final, authorized report of the government commission charged with investigating the calamity.</b><br /><br /> “The skies over the Korean Peninsula on March 21, 2020, were clear and blue.” So begins this sobering report on the findings of the Commission on the Nuclear Attacks against the United States, established by law by Congress and President Donald J. Trump to investigate the horrific events of the next three days. An independent, bipartisan panel led by nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis, the commission was charged with finding and reporting the relevant facts, investigating how the nuclear war began, and determining whether our government was adequately prepared for combating a nuclear adversary and safeguarding U.S. citizens. Did President Trump and his advisers understand North Korean views about nuclear weapons? Did they appreciate the dangers of provoking the country’s ruler with social media posts and military exercises? Did the tragic milestones of that fateful month—North Korea's accidental shoot-down of Air Busan flight 411, the retaliatory strike by South Korea, and the tweet that triggered vastly more carnage—inevitably lead to war? Or did America’s leaders have the opportunity to avert the greatest calamity in the history of our nation?<br /><br /> Answering these questions will not bring back the lives lost in March 2020. It will not rebuild New York, Washington, or the other cities reduced to rubble. But at the very least, it might prevent a tragedy of this magnitude from occurring again.

  <b>A remarkable book on the international operations of racism and the global meaning of Black Power</b>
</p><p>In this classic work published in the heady days of anti-colonial revolution, <i>Groundings with My Brothers</i> follows the global circulation of emancipatory ideas, from the black students of North America to the Rasta counterculture of Jamaica and beyond. The book is striking in its simultaneous ability to survey the wide and heterogeneous international context while remaining anchored in grassroots politics, as Rodney offers us first-hand accounts of mass movement organizing. Having inspired a generation of revolutionaries, this new edition will re-introduce the book to a new political landscape that it helped shape, with reflections from leading scholar-activists.</p>",4.47,144,Paperback, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45183918-the-groundings-with-my-brothers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45183918-the-groundings-with-my-brothers

She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, <i>progress</i>.<br /><br />Anna arrived amidst a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street.

He was also a startlingly original visionary with an imagination deep enough to whip up whole worlds, from the sexy, gritty funk paradise of “Uptown” to the mythical landscape of Purple Rain to the psychedelia of “Paisley Park.” But his most ambitious creative act was turning Prince Rogers Nelson, born in Minnesota, into Prince, the greatest pop star of his era. <br /><br /><i>The Beautiful Ones</i> is the story of how Prince became Prince—a first-person account of a kid absorbing the world around him and then creating a persona, an artistic vision, and a life, before the hits and fame that would come to define him.

The second part takes us into Prince’s early years as a musician, before his first album released, through a scrapbook of Prince’s writing and photos.

Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and he is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our era.<br /><br />In <i>The Ride of a Lifetime</i>, Robert Iger shares the lessons he’s learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees, and he explores the principles that are necessary for true leadership, including:<br /><br />• <b>Optimism.</b> Even in the face of difficulty, an optimistic leader will find the path toward the best possible outcome and focus on that, rather than give in to pessimism and blaming.<br />• <b>Courage.</b> Leaders have to be willing to take risks and place big bets. Fear of failure destroys creativity. <br />• <b>Decisiveness.</b> All decisions, no matter how difficult, can be made on a timely basis. Indecisiveness is both wasteful and destructive to morale.<br /> • <b>Fairness.</b> Treat people decently, with empathy, and be accessible to them. <br /><br />This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as the lowliest studio grunt at ABC. It’s also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the <i>Star Wars</i> mythology.<br /> <br />“The ideas in this book strike me as universal” Iger writes. “Not just to the aspiring CEOs of the world, but to anyone wanting to feel less fearful, more confidently <i>themselves</i>, as they navigate their professional and even personal lives.”",4.41,272,Kindle Edition, ,277,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45310145-the-ride-of-a-lifetime,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45310145-the-ride-of-a-lifetime

On her first night back, she encounters a new neighbor, a longtime ship captain who has found himself, for the first time in years, no longer at sea. As one summer night tumbles into another, Mira and the Captain’s voices drift across the balconies of their apartments, disclosing details and stories: of careers, of families, of love.<br /><br />For Mira, love has so often meant Aris, an ex-boyfriend and rising Greek politician who has recently become engaged to a movie star.

But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?<br /><br />Monique is not exactly on top of the world.

At least that's what Violet and her younger brother, Sam, were always told. When the Lyric sank off the coast of Maine, their great-great-great-grandmother didn't drown like the rest of the passengers. No, Fidelia swam to shore, fell in love, and founded Lyric, Maine, the town Violet and Sam returned to every summer. But wrecks seem to run in the family: Tall, funny, musical Violet can't stop partying with the wrong people. And, one beautiful summer day, brilliant, sensitive Sam attempts to take his own life.<br /><br />Shipped back to Lyric while Sam is in treatment, Violet is haunted by her family's missing piece -- the lost shipwreck she and Sam dreamed of discovering when they were children. Desperate to make amends, Violet embarks on a wildly ambitious mission: locate the Lyric, lain hidden in a watery grave for over a century. She finds a fellow wreck hunter in Liv Stone, an amateur local historian whose sparkling intelligence and guarded gray eyes make Violet ache in an exhilarating new way. Whether or not they find the Lyric, the journey Violet takes -- and the bridges she builds along the way -- may be the start of something like survival.<br /><br /><i>

Raised by two attentive parents in Washington, D.C., he’s a top student and a track star at his prestigious private high school. Bound for Harvard in the fall, his prospects are bright. But Niru has a painful secret: he is queer—an abominable sin to his conservative Nigerian parents. No one knows except Meredith, his best friend, the daughter of prominent Washington insiders—and the one person who seems not to judge him.<br /><br />When his father accidentally discovers Niru is gay, the fallout is brutal and swift. Coping with troubles of her own, however, Meredith finds that she has little left emotionally to offer him. As the two friends struggle to reconcile their desires against the expectations and institutions that seek to define them, they find themselves speeding toward a future more violent and senseless than they can imagine. Neither will escape unscathed.<br /><br />In the tradition of Junot Diaz’s The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Americanah, Speak No Evil explores what it means to be different in a fundamentally conformist society and how that difference plays out in our inner and outer struggles. It is a novel about the power of words and self-identification, about who gets to speak and who has the power to speak for other people.

Somewhere along the way, she’s forgotten that she’s young and beautiful, and that there’s a world outside of work—until she meets the son of the property developer who just acquired the retirement center.<br /><br />Teddy Prescott has spent the last few years partying, sleeping in late, tattooing himself when bored, and generally not taking life too seriously—something his father, who dreams of grooming Teddy into his successor, can’t understand. When Teddy needs a place to crash, his father seizes the chance to get him to grow up. He’ll let Teddy stay in one of the on-site cottages at the retirement home, but only if he works to earn his keep. Teddy agrees—he can change a few lightbulbs and clip some hedges, no sweat. But Ruthie has plans for Teddy too.<br /><br />Her two wealthiest and most eccentric residents have just placed an ad (yet another!) seeking a new personal assistant to torment. The women are ninety-year-old, four-foot-tall menaces, and not one of their assistants has lasted a full week. Offering up Teddy seems like a surefire way to get rid of the tall, handsome, unnerving man who won’t stop getting under her skin.<br /><br />Ruthie doesn’t count on the fact that in Teddy Prescott, the Biddies may have finally met their match. He’ll pick up Chanel gowns from the dry cleaner and cut Big Macs into bite-sized bits. He’ll do repairs around the property, make the residents laugh, and charm the entire villa.

Un debut arrollador.<br /><br />En diciembre de 2017 Kristen Roupenian publicó en el New Yorker el relato «Cat Person». De inmediato se hizo viral y se convirtió en uno de los más comentados y que más revuelo han generado entre los publicados por la revista, junto con los ya clásicos «La lotería» de Shirley Jackson y «Brokeback Mountain» de Annie Proulx.<br /><br />El cuento de Roupenian narra la historia de Margot, de veinte años, y Robert, de treinta y cuatro, que se conocen por internet, se citan en persona y mantienen un encuentro sexual que acaba de un modo tóxico y desastroso. La autora explicó que se inspiró «en un breve y desagradable encuentro que tuve con una persona a la que conocí online». En pleno escándalo Harvey Weinstein y emergencia del movimiento #MeToo, «Cat Person» se hizo viral. Y es que el cuento de Roupenian tiene la prodigiosa capacidad de plasmar de forma muy fidedigna la actual confusión en las relaciones entre sexos y la dificultad de las mujeres para romper con la asunción del papel de mero objeto de deseo y decir no.<br /><br />El relato está incluido, junto con otros once, en este volumen, en el que otra pieza, «The Good Boy», actúa en cierto modo como contrapunto, dando voz a un personaje masculino víctima de las perplejidades propias de su género en el siglo XXI. Roupenian despliega un registro vigoroso y cambiante, que va del realismo más crudo al toque sobrenatural, pasando por el humor perversamente negro, y nos ofrece historias como la de una pareja que incorpora a su vida sexual a una tercera persona como morboso testigo –primero para que los oiga hacer el amor, después para que los vea– hasta que el triángulo va adquiriendo derivas sadomasoquistas; la de una niña que el día de su cumpleaños formula un deseo de consecuencias terroríficas; la de una mujer que encuentra en una biblioteca un libro de conjuros y trata de hacer realidad su pretensión de que aparezca ante ella un hombre desnudo…<br /><br />Un libro cautivador sobre los roles de género, los misterios del deseo y el desconcierto de los seres humanos contemporáneos.

Even if its sensibilities were manifestly mid-century—the martinis, powerful male egos, and unquestioned authority of kings—<em>GQ </em>still seemed the red-hot center of the literary world. It was there that Miller began learning how to survive in a man’s world. Three years later, she forged her own path, becoming the first woman to take on the role of literary editor of <em>Esquire</em>, home to the male writers who had defined manhood itself— Hemingway, Mailer, and Carver. Up against this old world, she would soon discover that it wanted nothing to do with a “mere girl.” <br /><br />But this was also a unique moment in history that saw the rise of a new literary movement, as exemplified by <em>McSweeney</em>’s and the work of David Foster Wallace. A decade older than Miller, the mercurial Wallace would become the defining voice of a generation and the fiction writer she would work with most. He was her closest friend, confidant—and antagonist. Their intellectual and artistic exchange grew into a highly charged professional and personal relationship between the most prominent male writer of the era and a young woman still finding her voice. <br /><br />This memoir—a rich, dazzling story of power, ambition, and identity—ultimately asks the question “How does a young woman fit into this male culture and at what cost?” With great wit and deep intelligence, Miller presents an inspiring and moving portrayal of a young woman’s education in a land of men.",3.27,340,Hardcover, ,161,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45730112-in-the-land-of-men,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45730112-in-the-land-of-men

</em><strong> </strong><strong>finance editor David Enrich's</strong><strong> explosive exposé of the most scandalous bank in the world, revealing its shadowy ties to Donald Trump, Putin's Russia, and Nazi Germany</strong><br /><br /><strong>“A jaw-dropping financial thriller” —<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></strong><br /><br /><br />On a rainy Sunday in 2014, a senior executive at Deutsche Bank was found hanging in his London apartment. Bill Broeksmit had helped build the 150-year-old financial institution into a global colossus, and his sudden death was a mystery, made more so by the bank’s efforts to deter investigation. Broeksmit, it turned out, was a man who knew too much.<br /><br /><br />In <em>Dark Towers</em>, award-winning journalist David Enrich reveals the truth about Deutsche Bank and its epic path of devastation. Tracing the bank’s history back to its propping up of a default-prone American developer in the 1880s, helping the Nazis build Auschwitz, and wooing Eastern Bloc authoritarians, he shows how in the 1990s, via a succession of hard-charging executives, Deutsche made a fateful decision to pursue Wall Street riches, often at the expense of ethics and the law.<br /><br />Soon, the bank was manipulating markets, violating international sanctions to aid terrorist regimes, scamming investors, defrauding regulators, and laundering money for Russian oligarchs. Ever desperate for an American foothold, Deutsche also started doing business with a self-promoting real estate magnate nearly every other bank in the world deemed too dangerous to touch: Donald Trump. Over the next twenty years, Deutsche executives loaned billions to Trump, the Kushner family, and an array of scandal-tarred clients, including convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.<br /><br /><em>Dark Towers </em>is the never-before-told saga of how Deutsche Bank became the global face of financial recklessness and criminality—the corporate equivalent of a weapon of mass destruction. It is also the story of a man who was consumed by fear of what he’d seen at the bank—and his son’s obsessive search for the secrets he kept.",4.01,416,ebook, ,290,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45730424-dark-towers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45730424-dark-towers

Como resultado, se descompone la sociedad.<br /><br />Crisis de la representación política, atomización de los movimientos sociales y gentrificación de las ciudades son algunos de los signos del agotamiento de un modelo que ya no construye sociedades.

The regime takes the Book of Genesis absolutely at its word, with bizarre consequences for the women and men in its population. <br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of Offred, one of the unfortunate Handmaids under the new social order.

  <strong>Exploring the psychological dynamics of the relationship between a precocious yet naïve teenage girl and her magnetic and manipulative teacher, a brilliant, all-consuming read that marks the explosive debut of an extraordinary new writer.</strong>
</p><p><em>2000</em>. Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher. </p><p><em>2017.</em> Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed?</p><p>Alternating between Vanessa’s present and her past, <em>My Dark Vanessa</em> juxtaposes memory and trauma with the breathless excitement of a teenage girl discovering the power her own body can wield. Thought-provoking and impossible to put down, this is a masterful portrayal of troubled adolescence and its repercussions that raises vital questions about agency, consent, complicity, and victimhood. Written with the haunting intimacy of <em>The Girls</em> and the creeping intensity of <em>Room, My Dark Vanessa</em> is an era-defining novel that brilliantly captures and reflects the shifting cultural mores transforming our relationships and society itself.</p>",4.05,385,Kindle Edition, ,1075,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45865963-my-dark-vanessa,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45865963-my-dark-vanessa

Throughout, Bushnell documents 21st century dating phenomenon, such as the “Unintended Cub Situation” in which a sensible older woman suddenly becomes the love interest of a much younger man, the “Mona Lisa” Treatment—a vaginal restorative surgery often recommended to middle aged women, and what it’s really like to go on Tinder dates as a fifty something divorcee. Bushnell also updates one of her most celebrated stories from Sex and the City, “The Bicycle Boys,” a breed of New York man who was always trying to bring his bike up to women’s apartments. Once an anomaly, Bushnell charts their new ubiquitousness, in addition to where, and how to do your own man stalking via bicycle (and whether or not it’s worth it).<br /><br />In Is There Still Sex in The City? Bushnell looks at love and life from all angles—marriage and children, divorce and bereavement, as well as the very real pressures on women to maintain their youth and have it all.

Toklas</i>. Pantomiming the voice of her partner Alice, <i>The Autobiography </i>was actually Gertrude's work. But whoever the real author was, the uncharacteristically lucid and readable book won over the hearts of thousands of Americans, whose clamor to meet Gertrude and Alice in person convinced them to return to America for the first time in thirty years from their self-imposed exile in France.<br /><br />For more than six months, Gertrude and Alice crisscrossed America, from New England to California, from Minnesota to Texas, stopping at thirty-seven different cities along the way. They had tea with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, attended a star-studded dinner party at Charlie Chaplin's home in Beverly Hills, enjoyed fifty-yard-line seats at the annual Yale-Dartmouth football game, and rode along with a homicide detective through the streets of Chicago. They met with the Raven Society in Edgar Allan Poe's old room at the University of Virginia, toured notable Civil War battlefields, and ate Oysters Rockefeller for the first time at Antoine's Restaurant in New Orleans. Everywhere they went, they were treated like everyone's favorite maiden aunts--colorful, eccentric, and eminently quotable.<br /><br />In <i>Gertrude Stein Has Arrived</i>, noted literary biographer Roy Morris Jr. recounts with characteristic energy and wit the couple's rollicking tour, revealing how--much to their surprise--they rediscovered their American roots after three decades of living abroad. Entertaining and sympathetic, this clear-eyed account captures Gertrude Stein for the larger-than-life legend she was and shows the unique relationship she had with her indefatigable companion, Alice B.
