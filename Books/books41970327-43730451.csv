Rose, an Egyptologist, married an American journalist and immigrated to New York City, where she works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gameela, a devout Muslim since her teenage years, stayed in Cairo. During the aftermath of Egypt's revolution, Gameela is killed in a suicide bombing. When Rose returns to Egypt after the bombing, she sifts through the artifacts Gameela left behind, desperate to understand how her sister came to die, and who she truly was.

As Rose is struggling to reconcile her identities as an Egyptian and as a new American, she investigates Gameela's devotion to her religion and her country.

She tracks the misogyny and propaganda hidden (or not so hidden) in the media she and her peers devoured growing up, a buffet of distortions, delusions, prejudice, and outright bullsh*t that has allowed white male mediocrity to maintain a death grip on American culture and politics-and that delivered us to this precarious, disorienting moment in history.<br /><br />West writes, “We were just a hair’s breadth from electing America’s first female president to succeed America’s first black president. We weren’t done, but we were doing it. And then, true to form—like the Balrog’s whip catching Gandalf by his little gray bootie, like the husband in a Lifetime movie hissing, ‘If I can’t have you, no one can’—white American voters shoved an incompetent, racist con man into the White House.”<br /><br />We cannot understand how we got here-how the land of the free became Trump’s America—without examining the chasm between who we are and who we think we are, without fact—checking the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and each other.

It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole.</p><p>Bestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a millennial by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and getting to your appointments on time by destroying the moon. And if you want to get rid of this book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapour, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the sun.</p><p>By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in <i>What If?</i>, he invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible. Full of clever infographics and amusing illustrations, <i>How To</i> is a delightfully mind-bending way to better understand the science and technology underlying the things we do every day.</p>",4.18,320,Paperback, ,671,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42086897-how-to,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42086897-how-to

One man finds out in this finely observed, compulsively readable, and occasionally raunchy novel of marriage, sex, and dating for readers of Jonathan Franzen, Lauren Groff, and Tom Perrotta.</b><br /><br />Dr. Toby Fleishman wakes up each morning surrounded by women. Women who are self-actualized and independent and know what they want - and, against all odds, what they want is Toby. Who knew what kind of life awaited him once he finally extracted himself from his nightmare of a marriage? Who knew that there were women out there who would actually look at him with softness and desire? But just as the winds of his optimism are beginning to pick up, they're quickly dampened, and then extinguished, when his ex-wife, Rachel, suddenly disappears.<br />Toby thought he knew what to expect when he moved out: weekends and every other holiday with the kids, some residual bitterness, tense co-parenting negotiations. He never thought that one day, Rachel would just drop their children off at his place and never come back. As Toby tries to figure out what happened and what it means, all while juggling his patients at the hospital, his never-ending parental duties and his new, app-assisted sexual popularity, his tidy narrative of a spurned husband is his sole consolation. But if Toby ever wants to really understand where Rachel went and what really happened to his marriage, he is going to have to consider that he might not have seen it all that clearly in the first place.<br />A searing, funny, and electric debut from one of the most exciting writers working today, Fleishman Is In Trouble is an exploration of a culture trying to navigate the fault lines of an institution that has proven to be worthy of both our great wariness and our great optimism.",3.66,384,Kindle Edition, ,588,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42103980-fleishman-is-in-trouble,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42103980-fleishman-is-in-trouble

Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, <i>On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous</i> is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.<br /><br />With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are.

Though they tried to leave the horrors of their past behind, the pain they suffered crossed generational lines—a fact most apparent in the mental health of Adam’s mother. When Adam sat down with her to examine their family history in detail, he learned another shocking secret, this time one that unraveled Adam’s entire understanding of who he is.<br /><br />In the midst of piecing together a story of inherited familial trauma, Adam discovered he was only half of who he thought he was, knowledge that raised essential questions of identity. Who was he, if not his father’s son? If not part of a rich heritage of writers and public servants? Does it matter? What defines a family’s bonds? What will he pass on to his own children? To rewrite his story in truth and to build a life for his own young family, Adam had to navigate his pain to find answers and a way forward.<br /><br />Throughout this journey into the past, his family’s psyche, and his own understanding of identity, Adam comes to realize that while the nature of our families’ traumas may vary, each of us is faced with the same choice. We can turn away from what we’ve inherited—or, we can confront it, in the hopes of moving on and stopping that trauma from inflicting pain on future generations. The stories Adam shares with us in <em>The Survivors</em> are about the ways the past can haunt our future, the resilience that can be found on the other side of trauma, and the good that can come from things that are unspeakably bad. <strong></strong>",4.15,288,ebook, ,51,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42117228-the-survivors,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42117228-the-survivors

But in the nineteenth century, as grammar books became all the rage, the rules of how we use language became both stricter and more confusing, with the semicolon a prime victim. Taking us on a breezy journey through a range of examples—from Milton’s manuscripts to Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letters from Birmingham Jail” to Raymond Chandler’s <em>The Big Sleep</em>—Watson reveals how traditional grammar rules make us less successful at communicating with each other than we’d think. Even the most die-hard grammar fanatics would be better served by tossing the rule books and learning a better way to engage with language.<br /><br />Through her rollicking biography of the semicolon, Watson writes a guide to grammar that explains why we don’t need guides at all, and refocuses our attention on the deepest, most primary value of language: true communication.",3.62,4,Audiobook, ,133,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42117355-semicolon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42117355-semicolon

Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest. <br /><br />Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. ""At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,"" she muses. ""After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is."" Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, <i>City of Girls</i> is a love story like no other.",4.04,480,Kindle Edition, ,1410,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42140794-city-of-girls,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42140794-city-of-girls

In 1788 the first band of pioneers set out from New England for the Northwest Territory under the leadership of Revolutionary War veteran General Rufus Putnam. They settled in what is now Marietta on the banks of the Ohio River.<br /><br />McCullough tells the story through five major characters: Cutler and Putnam; Cutler’s son Ephraim; and two other men, one a carpenter turned architect, and the other a physician who became a prominent pioneer in American science. They and their families created a town in a primeval wilderness, while coping with such frontier realities as floods, fires, wolves and bears, no roads or bridges, no guarantees of any sort, all the while negotiating a contentious and sometimes hostile relationship with the native people. Like so many of McCullough’s subjects, they let no obstacle deter or defeat them.",3.76,352,Hardcover, ,1876,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42201377-the-pioneers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42201377-the-pioneers

We want to embrace renewable energy sources like wind and solar, and rely less on dirty fossil fuels. We don’t want to keep pumping so many heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Any transition from a North American power grid that uses mostly fossil fuels to one that is predominantly clean requires a massive building spree—billions of dollars’ worth.<br /> <br />Enter Michael Skelly, an infrastructure builder who began working on wind energy in 2000, when many considered the industry a joke. Eight years later, Skelly helped create the second largest wind power company in the United States—which was sold for $2 billion. Wind energy was no longer funny; it was well on its way to generating a substantial percentage of the electricity in the United States.<br /> <br />Acclaimed journalist and author of <i>The Boom</i>, “the best all-around book yet on fracking” (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>), Russell Gold tells the story of this pioneer whose innovations, struggles, and persistence represent the groundbreaking changes underway in American energy. In<i>Superpower</i>, we meet Skelly’s financial backers, a family that pivoted from oil exploration to renewable energy; the farmers ready to embrace the new “cash crop”; the landowners prepared to go to court to avoid looking at overhead wires; and utility executives who concoct fiendish ways to block renewable energy. Gold also shows how Skelly’s innovative company, Clean Line Energy, conceived the idea for a new power grid that would allow sunlight where abundant to light up homes thousands of miles away in cloudy states, and take wind from the Great Plains to keep air conditioners running in Atlanta. Thrilling, provocative, and important, <i>Superpower</i> is a fascinating look at America’s future.",4.32,336,Hardcover, ,38,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42201387-superpower,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42201387-superpower

A college track star and budding entomologist, Nnedi’s lifelong battle with scoliosis was just a bump in her plan—something a simple operation would easily correct. But when Nnedi wakes from the surgery to find she can’t move her legs, her entire sense of self begins to waver. Confined to a hospital bed for months, unusual things begin to happen. Psychedelic bugs crawl her hospital walls; strange dreams visit her nightly. Nnedi begins to put these experiences into writing, conjuring up strange, fantastical stories. What Nnedi discovers during her confinement would prove to be the key to her life as a successful science fiction author: In science fiction, when something breaks, something greater often emerges from the cracks.<br /><br />In <i>Broken Places &amp; Outer Spaces</i>, Nnedi takes the reader on a journey from her hospital bed deep into her memories, from her painful first experiences with racism as a child in Chicago to her powerful visits to her parents’ hometown in Nigeria. From Frida Kahlo to Mary Shelly, she examines great artists and writers who have pushed through their limitations, using hardship to fuel their work. Through these compelling stories and her own, Nnedi reveals a universal truth: What we perceive as limitations have the potential to become our greatest strengths—far greater than when we were unbroken.<br /><br />A guidebook for anyone eager to understand how their limitations might actually be used as a creative springboard, <i>Broken Places &amp; Outer Spaces</i> is an inspiring look at how to open up new windows in your mind.",4.09,112,Hardcover, ,171,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42202070-broken-places-outer-spaces,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42202070-broken-places-outer-spaces

</b><br /><br />First Son Alex Claremont-Diaz is the closest thing to a prince this side of the Atlantic. With his intrepid sister and the Veep’s genius granddaughter, they’re the White House Trio, a beautiful millennial marketing strategy for his mother, President Ellen Claremont. International socialite duties do have downsides—namely, when photos of a confrontation with his longtime nemesis Prince Henry at a royal wedding leak to the tabloids and threaten American/British relations.<br /><br />The plan for damage control: staging a fake friendship between the First Son and the Prince. Alex is busy enough handling his mother’s bloodthirsty opponents and his own political ambitions without an uptight royal slowing him down. But beneath Henry’s Prince Charming veneer, there’s a soft-hearted eccentric with a dry sense of humor and more than one ghost haunting him. <br /><br />As President Claremont kicks off her reelection bid, Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret relationship with Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations. And Henry throws everything into question for Alex, an impulsive, charming guy who thought he knew everything: What is worth the sacrifice? How do you do all the good you can do?

Antes de esa fecha, y sin registros sonoros disponibles, no tenemos ni idea de cómo sonaba el habla. Si oyéramos hoy a un romano del siglo I decir rosae quizá oiríamos algo parecido al rugido de un tigre o el sonido de una máquina. Y es que todas la cosas tienen su 'línea año cero', el lugar más allá del cual lo inventamos todo: ahí comienza la ficción. Y este libro termina desplegando toda una teoría alternativa acerca de qué es un producto artístico y qué es una máquina y un organismo, produciendo así nuevas acepciones a los conceptos 'natural' y 'artificial'. Entre medias, y por un camino tejido con una personalísima red de metáforas que aúnan lo poético y lo científico, veremos pasar cosas como una aeronáutica interpretación del Ángel de la Historia benjaminiano, o el porqué de la identidad de Occidente -forjada en la idea del viaje y en la construcción de 'el otro'-, o páginas que arrojarán nueva luz a las artes contemporáneas -especialmente al apropiacionismo-, o sabremos qué significa hoy la fragmentación y el ruido en la comunicación. De un disco de New Order al caballo que Nietzsche abrazó en Turín, del cine de Chris Marker a Lady Gaga, de las teorías de sistemas complejos a los Durmientes de Efeso, de la mitología del romanticismo a la no menos imposible mitología pop, o del porqué del reciente colapso económico mundial al 'Blues del Bosón de Higgs' que cantó Nick Cave, todo viene en este libro a resignificar nuestra cotidianidad. Teoría general de la basura fundamenta su principio en que no elaboramos artes y ciencias a través de la excelencia sino utilizando la basura pasada, los residuos que sin querer nos dejaron otros.

Putnam's Sons,,true,"For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet fishing village. Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.<br /><br />But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world–until the unthinkable happens.<br /><br />In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.<br /><br />The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.",4.47,379,Kindle Edition, ,9344,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42421761-where-the-crawdads-sing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42421761-where-the-crawdads-sing

As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?<br /> <br /> Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning <i>New Yorker </i>reporter and <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.<br /> <br /> In <i>The Library Book</i>, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.<br /> <br /> Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.<br /> <br /> Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, <i>The Library Book </i>is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country.

To have no memory of ever being alone.”<br /><br />Twin sisters Bibike and Ariyike are enjoying a relatively comfortable life in Lagos in 1996. Then their mother loses her job due to political strife, and the family, facing poverty, becomes drawn into the New Church, an institution led by a charismatic pastor who is not shy about worshipping earthly wealth. <br /><br />Soon Bibike and Ariyike’s father wagers the family home on a “sure bet” that evaporates like smoke. As their parents’ marriage collapses in the aftermath of this gamble, the twin sisters and their two younger siblings, Andrew and Peter, are thrust into the reluctant care of their traditional Yoruba grandmother. Inseparable while they had their parents to care for them, the twins’ paths diverge once the household shatters. Each girl is left to locate, guard, and hone her own fragile source of power. <br /><br />Written with astonishing intimacy and wry attention to the fickleness of fate, Tola Rotimi Abraham’s Black Sunday takes us into the chaotic heart of family life, tracing a line from the euphoria of kinship to the devastation of estrangement. In the process, it joyfully tells a tale of grace and connection in the midst of daily oppression and the constant incursions of an unremitting patriarchy.

Last year, she was a happy, even pampered housewife. This year, she's bolted from her marriage of almost twenty years, determined to make good on her youthful ambitions to live a passionate, meaningful life. Maddie wants to matter, to leave her mark on a swiftly changing world. Drawing on her own secrets, she helps Baltimore police find a murdered girl--assistance that leads to a job at the city's afternoon newspaper, the <em>Star.</em> Working at the newspaper offers Maddie the opportunity to make her name, and she has found just the story to do it: a missing woman whose body was discovered in the fountain of a city park lake.

Until now, when Lillian gets a letter from Madison pleading for her help.<br /><br />Madison’s twin stepkids are moving in with her family and she wants Lillian to be their caretaker.

But Susan Ware uncovered a much broader and more diverse story waiting to be told. <em>Why They Marched</em> is a tribute to the many women who worked tirelessly in communities across the nation, out of the spotlight, protesting, petitioning, and insisting on their right to full citizenship.<br /><br />Ware tells her story through the lives of nineteen activists, most of whom have long been overlooked. We meet Mary Church Terrell, a multilingual African American woman; Rose Schneiderman, a labor activist building coalitions on New York’s Lower East Side; Claiborne Catlin, who toured the Massachusetts countryside on horseback to drum up support for the cause; Mary Johnston, an aristocratic novelist bucking the Southern ruling elite; Emmeline W. Wells, a Mormon woman in a polygamous marriage determined to make her voice heard; and others who helped harness a groundswell of popular support. We also see the many places where the suffrage movement unfolded—in church parlors, meeting rooms, and the halls of Congress, but also on college campuses and even at the top of Mount Rainier. Few corners of the United States were untouched by suffrage activism.<br /><br />Ware’s deeply moving stories provide a fresh account of one of the most significant moments of political mobilization in American history.

From the acclaimed editor of <i>Remember Me to Harlem: The Letters of Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten</i> (""A major contribution,"" Henry Louis Gates; ""Magnificent,"" <i>Washington Post</i>).</b><br /><br />""I am black--and brown, too,"" writes Emily Bernard. ""Brown is the body I was born into. Black is the body of the stories I tell.""<br />    And the storytelling, and the mystery of Bernard's storytelling, of getting to the truth, begins with a stabbing in a New England college town. Bernard writes how, when she was a graduate student at Yale, she walked into a coffee shop and, along with six other people, was randomly attacked by a stranger with a knife (""I remember making the decision not to let the oddness of this stranger bother me""). ""I was not stabbed because I was black,"" she writes (the attacker was white), ""but I have always viewed the violence I survived as a metaphor for the violent encounter that has generally characterized American race relations. There was no connection between us, yet we were suddenly and irreparably bound by a knife, an attachment that cost us both: him, his freedom; me, my wholeness.""<br />    Bernard explores how that bizarre act of violence set her free and unleashed the storyteller in her (""The equation of writing and regeneration is fundamental to black American experience""). <br />    She writes in <i>Black Is the Body</i> how each of the essays goes beyond a narrative of black innocence and white guilt, how each is anchored in a mystery, and how each sets out to discover a new way of telling the truth as the author has lived it. ""Blackness is an art, not a science. It is a paradox: intangible and visceral; a situation and a story. It is the thread that connects these essays, but its significance as an experience emerges randomly, unpredictably . . . Race is the story of my life, and therefore black is the body of this book.""<br />    And what most interests Bernard is looking at ""blackness at its borders, where it meets whiteness in fear and hope, in anguish and love.""",4.09,240,Kindle Edition, ,22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42594252-black-is-the-body,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42594252-black-is-the-body

</p><p>In this electrifying short story by <i>New York Times</i> bestselling suspense master Jeffery Deaver, the destinies of seven strangers intersect in ways no one sees coming. It looks like just another gray March morning in the tough urban district nicknamed Nowhere when seven lives converge: a young man intent on buying a gun; the gangbanger who cuts him a deal; a by-the-book police officer on a last patrol; an advertising executive keeping secrets from her husband; a veteran haunted by a combat death; a single dad in a bitter custody battle; and a sharp-looking businessman en route to a new job he desperately needs. Any one of them could have a dark motive. Any one of them could be walking into a trap. When the fog lifts, it will all be much clearer—that a single, shattering act of violence has marked each of them forever.</p>",3.76,52,Kindle Edition, ,250,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42640875-ninth-and-nowhere,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42640875-ninth-and-nowhere

Perfect for fans of Celeste Ng, Tom Perrotta, Nick Hornby, and Liane Moriarty.<br /><br />Good schools, stately houses, safe neighborhoods, all set against a beautiful landscape. What else could a family want? It was with high hopes for the future that four young couples separately chose this Colorado town as the place to raise their children over a decade ago. Finding each other as friends further buoyed them over the ensuing years, as they juggled the stresses of parenthood, careers, and marriage. Even now, as the kids head for middle school, their individual interests and abilities becoming more and more distinct, the group of families has remained tight. But when an exclusive new school is introduced into the mix - an elite new standard to meet - it represents, at long last, one pressure too many.<br /><br />Gradually, throughout the community, cracks begin to form, and spread. As children are pitted against each other for coveted spots in the school, some parents shock themselves with the lengths they are secretly willing to go in the pursuit of prestige and recognition. Soon, long-buried resentments arise between friends and spouses alike, as ever more toxic instincts keep emerging. And the most shattering secret of all still lies waiting to be exposed.<br /><br />The Gifted School is a knowing, wickedly entertaining novel that at once provokes, skewers, and forgives, loves and understands its keenly observed characters.

The remains were those of a young woman, who police dubbed 'Angel' after a T-shirt emblazoned with the word 'Angelic' found nearby. But 'Angel' lay unidentified for years. Who was she, how did she die, and at whose hand?<br /><br />Then, in July 2015, the bones of an unknown child were found in a suitcase by a highway in South Australia. Weeks later, a call to Crime Stoppers was the lead police needed. Clothing and a blanket found near the suitcase matched those in a photo of two-year-old Khandalyce Pearce who, with her young mother, had left Alice Springs in 2008 and hadn't been seen since. Through DNA, police were quick to identify Angel as Karlie Pearce-Stevenson, Khandalyce's mother. In the grimmest of scenarios, mother and daughter were reunited at last.<br /><br /><strong>The Lost Girls</strong> is the chilling true story of this heinous double murder and how investigators tracked down the killer, who not only murdered the two girls but stole the young mother's identity to defraud authorities and her worried family of more than $70,000. It's the tale of a vivacious young woman keen to discover the world; a loving family desperate for answers; dedicated investigators who never give up; and a vicious killer with form who lies to the end in a bid to save himself.

In this collection, including two never-before-published essays, Nussbaum writes about her passion for television that began with stumbling upon ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""—a show that was so much more than it appeared—while she was a graduate student studying Victorian literature. What followed was a love affair with television, an education, and a fierce debate about whose work gets to be called “great” that led Nussbaum to a trailblazing career as a critic whose reviews said so much more about our culture than just what’s good on television. Through these pieces, she traces the evolution of female protagonists over the last decade, the complex role of sexual violence on TV, and what to do about art when the artist is revealed to be a monster. And she explores the links between the television antihero and the rise of Donald Trump.<br /><br />The book is more than a collection of essays. With each piece, Nussbaum recounts her fervent search, over fifteen years, for a new kind of criticism that resists the false hierarchy that elevates one form of culture over another. It traces her own struggle to punch through stifling notions of “prestige television,” searching for a wilder and freer and more varied idea of artistic ambition—one that acknowledges many types of beauty and complexity, and that opens to more varied voices. It’s a book that celebrates television as television, even as each year warps the definition of just what that might mean.",4.00,384,Hardcover, ,577,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42815538-i-like-to-watch,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42815538-i-like-to-watch

  <strong>A groundbreaking examination of human perception.</strong>
</p><br />Do we see the world as it truly is? In <em>The Case Against Reality</em>, cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman says no— our visual perceptions are not a window on reality, but instead are interfaces constructed by natural selection. What we see is not unlike the file icons on our computer desktops: while shaped like a small page on our screens, the files themselves are made of a series of numbers, of ones and zeros stored in an intangible way. In a similar way, Hoffman argues, evolution has shaped our perceptions into illusions. The sensory simplifications that once maximized our reproductive fitness are now impressions that can be manipulated by marketing and design.<br /><br /><br /><br />Drawing on thirty years of Hoffman’s own research, as well as work in evolutionary biology, game theory, neuroscience, computer science, information theory, and philosophy, <em>The Case Against Reality</em> explains why the world is nothing like what we see through our eyes.",3.83,272,Kindle Edition, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42847509-the-case-against-reality,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42847509-the-case-against-reality

They live in a honey-colored house in a picture-perfect Cotswolds village, with rambling, unkempt gardens stretching beyond. Pragmatic Meg, dreamy Beth, and tow-headed twins Rory and Rhys all attend the village school and eat home-cooked meals together every night. Their father is a sweet gangly man named Colin, who still looks like a teenager with floppy hair and owlish, round-framed glasses. Their mother is a beautiful hippy named Lorelei, who exists entirely in the moment. And she makes every moment sparkle in her children's lives.<br /><br />Then one Easter weekend, tragedy comes to call. The event is so devastating that, almost imperceptibly, it begins to tear the family apart. Years pass as the children become adults, find new relationships, and develop their own separate lives. Soon it seems as though they've never been a family at all. But then something happens that calls them back to the house they grew up in -- and to what really happened that Easter weekend so many years ago.<br /><br />Told in gorgeous, insightful prose that delves deeply into the hearts and minds of its characters, <i>The House We Grew Up In</i> is the captivating story of one family's desire to restore long-forgotten peace and to unearth the many secrets hidden within the nooks and crannies of home.",3.86,401,Kindle Edition,Reprint edition,111,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42853195-the-house-we-grew-up-in,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42853195-the-house-we-grew-up-in

</b><br /><br />Elissa and Rita have forever struggled to find their place in each other's worlds. Rita, an overreaching, makeup-addicted, narcissistic Manhattan singer couldn't be more different from Elissa, her gay, taciturn New England writer daughter. Stuck in an outrageous maelstrom of codependency, mother and daughter cannot seem to extricate themselves from the center of each other's lives. <i>Motherland</i> is their universal story: a kaleidoscopic journey built on the ferocity of mother-daughter love, moral obligation, and the possibility and promise of healing.<br /> <br />Having survived a harrowing childhood at the hands of her mother, Elissa is finally settled in Connecticut with her wife of almost twenty years. After much time, therapy, and wine, Elissa is at last in a healthy place, orbiting around her mother, but keeping far enough away from her to preserve the independent, quiet life she has built for herself. All of this is suddenly at risk when Rita, whose days are spent traversing the streets of Manhattan from Bergdorf's to Bloomingdale's and back again, suffers an incapacitating fall that leaves her fully dependent on her only child.<br /> <br />Forced to confront her mother's desperate need for beauty, her view of the world through a medley of men, her lost days in the spotlight, addiction, and the money that has mysteriously disappeared in the name of maintaining her youth, Elissa must navigate the waters of their shared history, obligation, the problems of caregiving and age, and the frenetic, co-dependent love that has defined their obsessive relationship. <i>Motherland</i> asks the universal mother-daughter question: How much love is too much love?<br /> <br />Filled with tenderness, wry irreverence, and unforgettable characters, <i>Motherland</i> is an exploration of what it means to escape from the shackles of the past only to have to face them again, finally, in the name of peace and the fragile mother-daughter bond.",3.83,272,Kindle Edition, ,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42866918-motherland,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42866918-motherland

In 2005, her critiques of US foreign policy caught the eye of newly elected senator Barack Obama, who invited her to work with him on Capitol Hill and then on his presidential campaign. After Obama was elected president, Power went from being an activist outsider to a government insider, navigating the halls of power while trying to put her ideals into practice.

As the ancient sages described it, this fundamental force is what gives us life and keeps us alive. It's physical, creative, mental, emotional, and sexual energy, it's the ""get up and go,"" it's physical vitality as well as star power and mojo. Since ancient times, it's been known that harnessing this fundamental energy of life itself is the key to thriving. In this book, Rajshree Patel explores what this energy is, how to enhance it, and how it gets drained (spoiler: the biggest energy hog of all is your own mind!).<br /><br />The book market is saturated with guides to living a better life using techniques such as mindfulness, stress reduction, and emotional intelligence--but many of these titles draw on the same studies and offer the same tips and tools. This book offers a much-needed new approach to managing our mind, regulating our emotions, and increasing vital energy. In these pages we find a fresh set of tools drawn from some of the world's most ancient wisdom to help us harness the power of pure energy. Patel, a senior teacher with the Art of Living Foundation--the largest organization in the world dedicated to teaching spiritual wisdom and practice in the Vedic tradition--shares easy, accessible techniques ranging from breathwork to nutrition to a cold-water foot bath that instantly shifts energy flow, all designed to reset and rejuvenate our systems for maximum life force.<br /><br />Ultimately, the less energy we have, the less we are alive; the more energy we have, the more we thrive--in whatever we are doing, in every part of our lives. Vital Force combines ancient wisdom with the principles of psychology, self-help, and business, offering a fresh approach to happiness and success.",3.95,256,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42875124-vital-force,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42875124-vital-force

This notion follows us into adulthood, where we tend to simply accept these established beliefs about our skillsets (i.e. that we don’t have “a math brain” or that we aren’t “the creative type”). These damaging—and as new science has revealed, false—assumptions have influenced all of us at some time, affecting our confidence and willingness to try new things and limiting our choices, and, ultimately, our futures.<br /><br />Stanford University professor, bestselling author, and acclaimed educator Jo Boaler has spent decades studying the impact of beliefs and bias on education. In <strong>
  <em>Limitless Mind</em>
</strong>, she explodes these myths and reveals the six keys to unlocking our boundless learning potential. Her research proves that those who achieve at the highest levels do not do so because of a genetic inclination toward any one skill but because of the keys that she reveals in the book. Our brains are not “fixed,” but entirely capable of change, growth, adaptability, and rewiring. Want to be fluent in mathematics? Learn a foreign language? Play the guitar? Write a book? The truth is not only that <em>anyone</em> at <em>any</em> <em>age can</em> learn <em>anything</em>, but the act of learning itself fundamentally changes who we are, and as Boaler argues so elegantly in the pages of this book, what we go on to achieve.<br /><br /> ",4.20, ,Kindle Edition, ,105,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42940498-limitless-mind,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42940498-limitless-mind

  <b>The untold story of the root cause of America's education crisis--and the seemingly endless cycle of multigenerational poverty.</b>
</b><br /><br />It was only after years within the education reform movement that Natalie Wexler stumbled across a hidden explanation for our country's frustrating lack of progress when it comes to providing every child with a quality education. The problem wasn't one of the usual scapegoats: lazy teachers, shoddy facilities, lack of accountability. It was something no one was talking about: the elementary school curriculum's intense focus on decontextualized reading comprehension skills at the expense of actual <i>knowledge</i>. In the tradition of Dale Russakoff's <i>The Prize </i>and Dana Goldstein's <i>The Teacher Wars</i>, Wexler brings together history, research, and compelling characters to pull back the curtain on this fundamental flaw in our education system--one that fellow reformers, journalists, and policymakers have long overlooked, and of which the general public, including many parents, remains unaware.<br /><br />But <i>The Knowledge Gap</i> isn't just a story of what schools have gotten so wrong--it also follows innovative educators who are in the process of shedding their deeply ingrained habits, and describes the rewards that have come along: students who are not only excited to learn but are also acquiring the knowledge and vocabulary that will enable them to succeed.

With no mercy and seemingly no motive, the Manson Family followed their leader's every order-their crimes lit a flame of paranoia across the nation, spelling the end of the sixties. Manson became one of history's most infamous criminals, his name forever attached to an era when charlatans mixed with prodigies, free love was as possible as brainwashing, and utopia-or dystopia-was just an acid trip away. <br /><br />Twenty years ago, when journalist Tom O'Neill was reporting a magazine piece about the murders, he worried there was nothing new to say. Then he unearthed shocking evidence of a cover-up behind the ""official"" story, including police carelessness, legal misconduct, and potential surveillance by intelligence agents. When a tense interview with Vincent Bugliosi-prosecutor of the Manson Family, and author of Helter Skelter-turned a friendly source into a nemesis, O'Neill knew he was onto something. But every discovery brought more questions:<br /><br />Who were Manson's real friends in Hollywood, and how far would they go to hide their ties?<br />Why didn't law enforcement, including Manson's own parole officer, act on their many chances to stop him?<br />And how did Manson-an illiterate ex-con-turn a group of peaceful hippies into remorseless killers?<br /><br />O'Neill's quest for the truth led him from reclusive celebrities to seasoned spies, from San Francisco's summer of love to the shadowy sites of the CIA's mind-control experiments, on a trail rife with shady cover-ups and suspicious coincidences. The product of two decades of reporting, hundreds of new interviews, and dozens of never-before-seen documents from the LAPD, the FBI, and the CIA, CHAOS mounts an argument that could be, according to Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Steven Kay, strong enough to overturn the verdicts on the Manson murders.

Targeting only those she knows won large sums of money from her father, bleeding him dry and causing him to take his own life, she decides to teach them a lesson. She takes something valuable from each, leaving her calling card with a bible quote behind her. On her last outing, she is caught red-handed. Her surprise that the old Earl had died and been succeeded by his handsome, much sought-after son, is only equalled by his amazement that the thief should be a young, beautiful lady of quality. <br /> <br />Bored, restless and guilt-ridden over the death of his own father and with his accusations of him being a selfish whelp still ringing in his ears, Lord Atherton heads off a bow street runner who is pursuing Rosalind and in an altruistic act he engages her to be a companion to his mother, leading her to believe he is making amends for his father’s actions. Unaware that he has become the target of enmity from a desperate gambler from whom he has won a large sum of money, they are thrown into a series of increasingly dangerous situations. <br /> <br />Her brave responses to danger in no way reflect the behaviour expected of a traditional sweet young lady and frequently clash with his increasing sense of responsibility towards her. Her resentment at his frequent disapproval is increased when she discovers he hired her under false pretenses. Recognizing that her own happy ever after is as far away as ever, her pride dictates that she must leave her position and the new-found warmth and friendship she has found in the Atherton household. <br /> <br />Will they manage to overcome both pride and prejudice to finally find happiness or will an unexpected letter from a solicitor drive a final wedge between them? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />",4.16,252,Kindle Edition, ,22,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43050499-rosalind,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43050499-rosalind

She’s enchanted by the harsh, glamorous world she discovers: the sleek socialites sipping bootlegged cocktails, the rowdy ex-servicemen playing poker in a curtained back room, the flirtatious jazz pianist and the brooding photographer—all overseen by the club’s imposing owner, Signora Castallazzo. But the staff buzzes with whispers about Gina’s predecessor, who died under mysterious circumstances, and the photographer, Marty, warns her to be careful. </p><p>When Marty is brutally murdered, with Gina as the only witness, she’s determined to track down his killer. What secrets did Marty capture on his camera—and who would do anything to destroy it? As Gina searches for answers, she’s pulled deeper into the shadowy truths hiding behind the Third Door.</p>",3.85, ,Kindle Edition, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43062523-murder-knocks-twice,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43062523-murder-knocks-twice

But one rogue researcher looked at the data and decided everyone was wrong. Franz Boas was the very image of a mad scientist: wild haired and scarred, an immigrant with a thick German accent, but by the 1920s he was the founding figure and public face of a new school of thought at Columbia University that he called cultural anthropology. He proposed that cultures did not exist on a continuum from primitive to advanced. Instead, every culture solves the same social challenges with its own sets of rules, beliefs and taboos. Once you could see the value in another culture's strange ways, you could see that your own ways were not right or better, only different. <br /> Boas's students were some of the century's intellectual stars: Margaret Mead, the outspoken field researcher whose <i>Coming of Age in Samoa</i> is one of the most widely read works of social science of all time; Ruth Benedict, Boas's chief assistant and the great love of Mead's life, whose research for the U.S. government shaped post-WWII Japan; Ella Cara Deloria, the Dakota Sioux activist who preserved the traditions of plains Indians; Zora Neale Hurston, whose ethnographic studies under Boas fed directly into her now-classic novel, <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>; and others who left Columbia to create the country's foremost departments of anthropology.<br /> From Arctic outposts to South Pacific islands, <i>The Humanity Lab</i> weaves together their lives as they mapped vanishing civilizations and overturned the relationship between biology and behavior.

Over the years, she's turned inward, finding pleasure in language, her work as a gardener, and keeping her neighbors at arm's length while keenly observing them. But when she is unexpectedly granted some leave from her job, May is inspired to reconnect with four once close friends. She knows they will never have a proper reunion, so she goes, one-by-one, to each of them. A student of the classics, May considers her journey a female Odyssey.

Deeply alert to the nobility and the ridiculousness of ordinary people, May savors the pleasures along the way--afternoon ice cream with a long-lost friend, surprise postcards from an unexpected crush, and a moving encounter with ancient beauty. Though she gets a taste of viral online fame, May chooses to bypass her friends' perfectly cultivated online lives to instead meet them in their messy analog ones.<br /><br />Ultimately, May learns that a best friend is someone who knows your story--and she inspires us all to master the art of visiting.",3.76,304,Kindle Edition, ,73,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43064892-rules-for-visiting,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43064892-rules-for-visiting

  <p>In seeking to discover his inner self, the brilliant Dr Jekyll discovers a monster. First published to critical acclaim in 1886, this mesmerising thriller is a terrifying study of the duality of man's nature, and it is the book which established Stevenson's reputation as a writer.</p>

  <p>Also included in this volume is Stevenson's 1887 collection of short stories, <em>The Merry Men and Other Tales and Fables.</em></p>
</div><br /><p></p><div>
  <p><em>The Merry Men</em> is a gripping Highland tale of shipwrecks and madness; <em>Markheim</em>, the sinister study of the mind of a murderer; <em>Thrawn Janet</em>, a spine-chilling tale of demonic possession; <em>Olalla</em>, a study of degeneration and incipient vampirism in the Spanish mountains; <em>Will O' the Mill</em>, a thought-provoking fable about a mountain inn-keeper; and <em>The Treasure of Franchard</em>, a study of French bourgeois life.</p>

Who gets to decide? How much power, in the end, do we have over our own bodies? Mallie, her family, and her town find themselves at the center of a media storm, confronting questions nobody should have to face. And when Mallie emerges from the fog, what will she think of the choices that were made on her behalf?<br /><br /><i>The Opposite of Fate</i> is an intense and moving exploration of the decisions we make—and don’t make—that forever change the course of our lives.",3.70,272,Hardcover, ,72,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43210982-the-opposite-of-fate,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43210982-the-opposite-of-fate

It's a story that will make young readers reevaluate the word ""normal""--not only as it applies to others, but to themselves. Any book that can do that is pretty wondrous, as far as I'm concerned."" </b><b>--R.J. Palacio, author of <i>Wonder</i></b></b><i>Normal</i>. Who is to say what this word means? For Magda Newman, it was a goal. She wanted her son Nathaniel to be able to play on the playground, swim at the beach, enjoy the moments his friends took for granted. But Nathaniel's severe Treacher Collins syndrome--a craniofacial condition--meant that other concerns came first. Could he eat without the aid of a gastrointestinal tube? Could he hear? Would he ever be able to breathe effortlessly? But Nathaniel looks at ""normal"" from a completely different perspective. In this uplifting and humorous memoir that includes black-and-white comic illustrations, mother and son tell the story of his growing up--from facing sixty-seven surgeries before the age of fifteen, to making friends, moving across the country, and persevering through hardships. How they tackle extraordinary circumstances with love and resilience is a true testament to Magda and Nathaniel's family, and to families everywhere who quietly but courageously persist.",4.16,336,Hardcover,young reader's edition,51,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43261134-normal,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43261134-normal

Leif, mesmerizing and enigmatic, invites Matthew to meet his friends, who are experimenting with tarot cards. It's easier to know what's in other people's minds than most people realize, the friends claim. Do they believe in telepathy? Can they actually do it? Though Matthew should be writing his dissertation on the poetry of kingship, he soon finds himself falling in love with Leif--a poet of the internet age--and entangled with Leif's group as they visit the Occupy movement's encampment across the river, where they hope their ideas about radical empathy will help heal a divided world and destabilize the 1%.<br /><br />When the group falls afoul of a security contractor freelancing for the government, the news coverage, internet outrage, and legal repercussions damage the romances and alliances that hold the friends together, and complicate the faith the members of the group have--or, in some cases, don't have--in the powers they've been nurturing. Elspeth and Raleigh, two of Leif's oldest friends, will see if their relationship can weather the strains of criminal charges; Chris and Julia, who drifted into the group more recently, will have their loyalties tested; and Matthew, entranced by the man at the center of it all, will have to decide what he owes Leif and how much he's willing to give him.

But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world’s most elite universities on a full ride. What’s the catch, and why her?<br /><br />Still searching for answers to this herself, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale’s secret societies. These eight windowless “tombs” are well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street and Hollywood’s biggest players. But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive.",4.05,476,Kindle Edition, ,895,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43301737-ninth-house,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43301737-ninth-house

Where did we come from ? Many of us believe our ancestors have lived in South Asia since 'time immemorial'. But, as it turns out, 'time immemorial' may not have been all that long ago. To tell us the story of our ancestry, journalist Tony Joseph goes 65,000 years into the past—when a band of modern humans, or Homo sapiens, first made their way from Africa into the Indian subcontinent. <br /><br />Citing recent DNA evidence, he traces the subsequent large migrations of modern humans into India—of agriculturalists from Iran between 7000 and 3000 BCE and pastoralists from the Central Asian Steppe between 2000 and 1000 BCE, among others. <br /><br />As Joseph unravels our history using the results of genetic and other research, he takes head-on some of the most controversial and uncomfortable questions of Indian history: Who were the Harappans? Did the 'Aryans' really migrate to India? Are North Indians genetically different from South Indians? And are the various castes genetically distinct groups? <br /><br />This book relies heavily on path-breaking DNA research of recent years. But it also presents earlier archaeological and linguistic evidence—all in an entertaining and highly readable manner. A hugely significant book, Early Indians authoritatively and bravely puts to rest several ugly debates on the ancestry of modern Indians. It not only shows us how the modern Indian population came to be composed as it is, but also reveals an undeniable and important truth about who we are: we are all migrants.

Broom's mother Ivory Mae bought a shotgun house in the then-promising neighborhood of New Orleans East and built her world inside of it. It was the height of the Space Race and the neighborhood was home to a major NASA plant--the postwar optimism seemed assured. Widowed, Ivory Mae remarried Sarah's father Simon Broom; their combined family would eventually number twelve children. But after Simon died, six months after Sarah's birth, the Yellow House would become Ivory Mae's thirteenth and most unruly child.<br /><br />A book of great ambition, Sarah M. Broom's <i>The Yellow House</i> tells a hundred years of her family and their relationship to home in a neglected area of one of America's most mythologized cities. This is the story of a mother's struggle against a house's entropy, and that of a prodigal daughter who left home only to reckon with the pull that home exerts, even after the Yellow House was wiped off the map after Hurricane Katrina. <i>The Yellow House</i> expands the map of New Orleans to include the stories of its lesser known natives, guided deftly by one of its native daughters, to demonstrate how enduring drives of clan, pride, and familial love resist and defy erasure. Located in the gap between the ""Big Easy"" of tourist guides and the New Orleans in which Broom was raised, <i>The Yellow House</i> is a brilliant memoir of place, class, race, the seeping rot of inequality, and the internalized shame that often follows.

Now that her father is on his deathbed, Alex—a strong-headed lawyer, devoted mother, and loving sister--feels she can finally unearth the secrets of who Victor is and what he did over the course of his life and career. (A power-hungry real estate developer, he is, by all accounts, a bad man.) She travels to New Orleans to be with her family, but mostly to interrogate her tightlipped mother, Barbra.<br /><br /> As Barbra fends off Alex’s unrelenting questions, she reflects on her tumultuous life with Victor. Meanwhile Gary, Alex’s brother, is incommunicado, trying to get his movie career off the ground in Los Angeles. And Gary’s wife, Twyla, is having a nervous breakdown, buying up all the lipstick in drug stores around New Orleans and bursting into crying fits. Dysfunction is at its peak.

Through these essays and through forays into her own obsessions and longings, Jamison delves into the nature of storytelling itself. We wonder alongside her whether it is ever really possible to hear someone else's story without somehow making it our own, without seeing it through the cracked windows of our private selves.<br /><br />Throughout these essays, Jamison, who has frequently been compared to Joan Didion and Susan Sontag, shines the spotlight every bit as uncomfortably on herself as she does on others. Unlike the standard journalistic practice, Jamison acknowledges her emotional investment in her subjects, always with utmost clarity and unwavering empathy. In her view, true art cannot be made any other way.

St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides. <br /> <br />Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives ""lickings"" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a ""tattle-tale."" <br /> <br />As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get ""engaged"" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been ""engaged"" previously to Amy Lawrence.

It was only after that year--a remarkable turning point--that Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia began to use religion as a tool in their competition for dominance in the region, igniting the culture wars that led to the 1991 American invasion of Iraq, the September 11th terrorist attacks, and the rise of ISIS.<br /><br />Ghattas shows how Saudi Arabia and Iran went from allies against the threat of communism from Russia, with major roles in the US anti-Soviet strategy, to mortal enemies that use religious conservatism to incite division and unrest from Egypt to Pakistan. <i>Black Wave</i> will significantly influence both perception of and conversation about the modern history of the Middle East.",4.45,400,Hardcover, ,163,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43565323-black-wave,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43565323-black-wave

With magic clawing at the kingdom's borders, the great wizard Merlin conjured a solution--send in Guinevere to be Arthur's wife . . . and his protector from those who want to see the young king's idyllic city fail.

But what about the innate survival instincts that told Gooley to move on one night, just as he was about to make camp? Everything looked perfect, but something felt wrong.

Chosen for his original perspective and gift with language, his role was to help shape the nation’s hopes and sense of itself. For nearly ten years, Rhodes was at the centre of the Obama Administration – first as a speechwriter, then a policymaker, and finally a multi-purpose aide and close collaborator.<br /><br />Rhodes puts us in the room at the most tense and poignant moments in recent history: starting every morning with Obama in the Daily Briefing; waiting out the bin Laden raid in the Situation Room; reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran; leading secret negotiations with the Cuban government; confronting the resurgence of nationalism that led to the election of Donald Trump.<br /><br /><b>This is the most vivid portrayal yet of Obama’s presidency.

</p><p>Josie Bianci was killed years ago on a train during a terrorist attack. Gone forever. It’s what her sister, Kit, an ER doctor in Santa Cruz, has always believed. Yet all it takes is a few heart-wrenching seconds to upend Kit’s world. Live coverage of a club fire in Auckland has captured the image of a woman stumbling through the smoke and debris. Her resemblance to Josie is unbelievable. And unmistakable. With it comes a flood of emotions—grief, loss, and anger—that Kit finally has a chance to put to rest: by finding the sister who’s been living a lie.</p><p>After arriving in New Zealand, Kit begins her journey with the memories of the past: of days spent on the beach with Josie. Of a lost teenage boy who’d become part of their family. And of a trauma that has haunted Kit and Josie their entire lives.</p><p>Now, if two sisters are to reunite, it can only be by unearthing long-buried secrets and facing a devastating truth that has kept them apart far too long.

It's widely discussed and celebrated in the culture. At the same time, many guys are learning about game and evolutionary biology, which together discuss what women find attractive and how to use that knowledge to meet and have sex with attractive women. But no one is discussing how non-monogamy (including sex clubs, sex parties, and group dates) and the game fit together. Yet that's what's I've been doing for the past ten years. This book synthesizes everything I've done and experienced over this time period. You'll learn why non-monogamy is popular; how non-monogamy works in practice; what successful non-monogamy looks like; and how to propose non-monogamy to your lovers. Sex clubs are not a shortcut to having real game. Sex clubs are an extension of existing game.

But if you have game, non-monogamy can be a powerful accelerant to your dating and relationship portfolio. Myths and incorrect information abound in this field. Many guys in the game think non-monogamy is something only out-there fruits are willing to try. Many people doing non-monogamy are blinded by blank-slate ideology and foolish optimism about human nature.

He is also a Chippewa Council member who is trying to understand the consequences of a new “emancipation” bill on its way to the floor of the United States Congress. It is 1953 and he and the other council members know the bill isn’t about freedom; Congress is fed up with Indians. The bill is a “termination” that threatens the rights of Native Americans to their land and their very identity. How can the government abandon treaties made in good faith with Native Americans “for as long as the grasses shall grow, and the rivers run”?<br /><br />Since graduating high school, Pixie Paranteau has insisted that everyone call her Patrice. Unlike most of the girls on the reservation, Patrice, the class valedictorian, has no desire to wear herself down with a husband and kids. She makes jewel bearings at the plant, a job that barely pays her enough to support her mother and brother. Patrice’s shameful alcoholic father returns home sporadically to terrorize his wife and children and bully her for money. But Patrice needs every penny to follow her beloved older sister, Vera, who moved to the big city of Minneapolis. Vera may have disappeared; she hasn’t been in touch in months, and is rumored to have had a baby. Determined to find Vera and her child, Patrice makes a fateful trip to Minnesota that introduces her to unexpected forms of exploitation and violence, and endangers her life.<br /><br />Thomas and Patrice live in this impoverished reservation community along with young Chippewa boxer Wood Mountain and his mother Juggie Blue, her niece and Patrice’s best friend Valentine, and Stack Barnes, the white high school math teacher and boxing coach who is hopelessly in love with Patrice.<br /><br />In the <em>Night Watchman</em>, Louise Erdrich creates a fictional world populated with memorable characters who are forced to grapple with the worst and best impulses of human nature.

Kidane, an officer in Emperor Haile Selassie’s army, rushes to mobilize his strongest men before the Italians invade. His initial kindness to Hirut shifts into a flinty cruelty when she resists his advances, and Hirut finds herself tumbling into a new world of thefts and violations, of betrayals and overwhelming rage. Meanwhile, Mussolini’s technologically advanced army prepares for an easy victory. Hundreds of thousands of Italians—Jewish photographer Ettore among them—march on Ethiopia seeking adventure.<br /><br />As the war begins in earnest, Hirut, Aster, and the other women long to do more than care for the wounded and bury the dead. When Emperor Haile Selassie goes into exile and Ethiopia quickly loses hope, it is Hirut who offers a plan to maintain morale. She helps disguise a gentle peasant as the emperor and soon becomes his guard, inspiring other women to take up arms against the Italians. But how could she have predicted her own personal war as a prisoner of one of Italy’s most vicious officers, who will force her to pose before Ettore’s camera?<br /><br />What follows is a gorgeously crafted and unputdownable exploration of female power, with Hirut as the fierce, original, and brilliant voice at its heart.

</b><br />In <i>Dreams of El Dorado</i>, H. W. Brands tells the thrilling, panoramic story of the settling of the American West. He takes us from John Jacob Astor's fur trading outpost in Oregon to the Texas Revolution, from the California gold rush to the Oklahoma land rush. He shows how the migrants' dreams drove them to feats of courage and perseverance that put their stay-at-home cousins to shame-and how those same dreams also drove them to outrageous acts of violence against indigenous peoples and one another. The West was where riches would reward the miner's persistence, the cattleman's courage, the railroad man's enterprise; but El Dorado was at least as elusive in the West as it ever was in the East.<br /><br />Balanced, authoritative, and masterfully told, <i>Dreams of El Dorado </i>sets a new standard for histories of the American West.",4.17,544,Hardcover, ,113,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43730451-dreams-of-el-dorado,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43730451-dreams-of-el-dorado
