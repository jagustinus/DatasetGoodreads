To rescue the woman he loves and locate the source of the gun, Hadron of Hastor must run the gauntlet of giant Martians, man-eating apes and a xenophobic city where he is sentenced to ""The Death"" - a place of roiling horror that will carry him to the weapon's mad inventor...and a surprising twist of fate.<br /><br /><b>Sword of Mars</b>: John Carter hires on as bodyguard to Fal Sivas, a scientist who steals ideas from other inventors and then has them killed.

Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain.

She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves. <br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children.

Now, in <em>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</em>, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining.<br /><br />Drawing on his own journey from a naïve, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life—one not rooted in creed or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community.<br /><br />In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus's character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith.",4.03,160,Paperback, ,274,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40531.Meeting_Jesus_Again_for_the_First_Time,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40531.Meeting_Jesus_Again_for_the_First_Time

The USA invaded Iraq with grand ambitions to bring democracy &amp; thereby transform the Middle East. Instead, Iraq has disintegrated into three constituent components: a pro-western Kurdistan in the north, an Iran-dominated Shiite entity in the south &amp; a chaotic Sunni Arab region in the center. The country is plagued by insurgency &amp; is in the opening phases of a potentially catastrophic civil war. George W. Bush broke up Iraq when he ordered its invasion in '03. The USA not only removed Saddam Hussein, it also smashed &amp; later dissolved the institutions by which Iraq's Sunni Arab minority ruled: its army, its security services &amp; the Baath Party. With these institutions gone &amp; irreplaceable, the basis of an Iraqi state has disappeared. This book describes the administration's strategic miscalculations behind the war as well as the blunders of the occupation. There was the failure to understand the intensity of ethnic &amp; religious divisions. This was followed by incoherent &amp; inconsistent strategies for governing, the failure to spend money for reconstruction, the misguided effort to create a national army &amp; police, then the turning over of the country's management to Republican political loyalists rather than qualified professionals. As a matter of morality the Iraqi Kurds are no less entitled to independence than are Lithuanians, Croatians or Palestinians. If the country's majority Shiites want to run their own affairs, or even have their own state, on what democratic principle should they be denied? If the price of a unified Iraq is another dictatorship it's too high a price to pay. The USA must focus now, not on preserving or forging a unified Iraq, but on avoiding a spreading civil war. It must accept the reality of Iraq's breakup &amp; work with Iraq's Shiites, Kurds &amp; Sunni Arabs to strengthen the already semi-independent regions. If they're properly constituted, these regions can provide security, tho not all will be democratic. There's no easy exit from Iraq. We have to relinquish present strategy--trying to build national institutions when there is in fact no nation. That effort is doomed. It will only leave the USA with an open-ended commitment in circumstances of uncontrollable turmoil. Galbraith has been in Iraq many times over the last 21 years during historic turning points for the country: the Iran-Iraq War, the Kurdish genocide, the '91 uprising, the immediate aftermath of the '03 war &amp; the writing of Iraq's constitutions. In The End of Iraq, he offers 1sthand observations of the men who are now Iraq's leaders. He draws on his nearly two decades of involvement in Iraq policy working for the US government to appraise what has occurred &amp; what will happen.

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a <i>fixed mindset</i> — those who believe that abilities are fixed — are less likely to flourish than those with a <i>growth mindset</i> — those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.<br /><br />In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love — to transform their lives and your own.",4.06,276,Hardcover, ,6090,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset

Instead, he found boredom, alcohol and bureaucracy. As a dishwasher and garbage man at McMurdo Station, Johnson quickly shed his illusions about Antarctica. Since he and his co-workers seldom ventured beyond the station's grim, functional buildings, they spent most of their time finding ways to entertain themselves, drinking beer, bowling and making home movies. The dormlike atmosphere, complete with sexual hijinks and obscene costume parties, sometimes made life there feel like ""a cheap knock-off of some original meaty experience."" What dangers there were existed mostly in the psychological realm; most people who were there through the winter developed the ""Antarctica stare,"" an unnerving tendency to forget what they were saying mid-sentence and gaze dumbly at the station walls. And if the cold and isolation didn't drive one crazy, the petty hatreds and mindless red tape might. Though occasionally rambling and uneven, this memoir offers an insider's look at a place that few people know anything about and fewer still have ever seen.<br /><br />Johnson’s savagely funny [book] is a grunt’s-eye view of fear and loathing, arrogance and insanity in a dysfunctional, dystopian closed community.

""TR"" typifies the ""can do"" American; his famous maxim, of course, was ""Speak softly but carry a big stick."" Morris presents eyewitness history through the voices of the makers and shakers. His exhilarating narrative will captivate readers, providing welcome confirmation that this nation can produce presidents who bring leadership to great issues, hold to their purpose, and shape the destinies of nations. <br /><br />President McKinley's assassination brought the 43-year-old TR a challenging presidency, one to which Morris is a clearsighted guide. At home, TR had to persuade Congress to curb competition-stifling corporate trusts, monopolistic transcontinental railroads, and unhygienic food industries that saw consumers as sheep. He also faced labor and racial strife. Abroad, the American presence in Cuba and the Philippines brought criticism, the Russo-Japanese conflict threatened major power shifts in the Far East and Europe, and a politically and financially fraught decision on the Central American canal route - Panama or Nicaragua? - had to be made. TR rose to every challenge. Despite the demands of family and social life, he read, wrote, and traveled extensively. Not least, TR put national parks and conservation of natural resources on the legislative agenda.<br /><br />All TR's notable contemporaries - including historian Henry Adams, naturalists John Burroughs and John Muir, robber barons E. H. Harriman and James J. Hill, poet Oliver Wendell Holmes, financier J. P. Morgan, fellow politician William Howard Taft, civil rights leader Booker T. Washington, and novelist Owen Wister - appear onstage, their clear voices projecting the excitement of the day.<br /><br />Morris is blessed with the imagination and skills to write gripping popular history. He doesn't dilute but illuminates events in presenting an account that immediately sparks interest and captures the mind. Readers will note that American interventionism abroad (today's major issue) was much debated during TR's presidency, when major interventional imperatives challenged the new superpower's tradition of relative restraint in foreign affairs.<br /><br /><i>Theodore Rex</i> is the long-awaited second volume of the TR saga.

He begins with Copernicus, during the Renaissance, when science replaced mysticism as a means of explaining the workings of the world, and he continues through the centuries, creating an unbroken genealogy of not only the greatest but also the more obscure names of Western science, a dot-to-dot line linking amateur to genius, and accidental discovery to brilliant deduction.<br /><br />By focusing on the scientists themselves, Gribbin has written an anecdotal narrative enlivened with stories of personal drama, success and failure.

No artist was wholly immune to it. The influence of Romanticism--the artist's response to that shock--was all pervasive. As Hugh Honour writes: ""To some degree all subsequent Western art derives from it just as all European history since 1789 has been to some extent a consequence of the French Revolution. Romantic ideas about artistic creativity, originality, individuality, authenticity and integrity and the Romantic conception of the meaning and purpose of works of art and the role of the artist continue to dominate aesthetic thought. So deeply are they embedded in our attitudes and ways of thinking that we are rarely aware of them.""<br /><br />In fact Romanticism defies definition and classification into a simple formula. There is no romantic style in the visual arts comparable with Baroque or Rococo. There is no single work of art that exemplifies the aims and ideals of the Romantics. Romanticism might also be seen as part of the continuous development from the rejection of the Rococo in the mid-eighteenth century to the emergence of Realism in the mid-nineteenth. And there are elements of Romanticism that seem uncannily modern, such as the large, almost abstract, late paintings by Turner, or the almost ""Internationally Modern"" buildings by Schinkel.<br /><br />Hugh Honour's highly praised <i>Neo-classicism</i> discussed an earlier artistic revolution. In <i>Romanticism</i> he considers the more momentous one that followed. This penetrating study of a complex and contradictory half-century will be essential reading for an understanding of the Romantic movement.",3.81,416,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41046.Romanticism,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41046.Romanticism

It took place in the improbable setting of the mud, cold rain and senseless killing of the trenches of World War I. It happened in spite of orders to the contrary by superiors; it happened in spite of language barriers. And it still stands as the only time in history that peace spontaneously arose from the lower ranks in a major conflict, bubbling up to the officers and temporarily turning sworn enemies into friends.<p> <i>Silent Night,</i> by renowned military historian Stanley Weintraub, magically restores the 1914 Christmas Truce to history. It had been lost in the tide of horror that filled the battlefields of Europe for months and years afterward. Yet in December 1914 the Great War was still young, and the men who suddenly threw down their arms and came together across the front lines to sing carols, exchange gifts and letters, eat and drink and even play friendly games of soccer naively hoped that the war would be short-lived, and that they were fraternizing with future friends. </p><p> It began when German soldiers lit candles on small Christmas trees, and British, French, Belgian and German troops serenaded each other on Christmas Eve. Soon they were gathering and burying the dead, in an age-old custom of truces. But as the power of Christmas grew among them, they broke bread, exchanged addresses and letters and expressed deep admiration for one another. When angry superiors ordered them to recommence the shooting, many men aimed harmlessly high overhead. </p><p> Sometimes the greatest beauty emerges from deep tragedy. Surely the forgotten Christmas Truce was one of history's most beautiful moments, made all the more beautiful in light of the carnage that followed it. Stanley Weintraub's moving re-creation demonstrates that peace can be more fragile than war, but also that ordinary men can bond with one another despite all efforts of politicians and generals to the contrary.</p>",3.60,256,Paperback, ,185,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41491.Silent_Night,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41491.Silent_Night

There is, however, something uneasy in the air: one woman in the group about to be feted, Alison Kendall, a beautiful, high-powered Hollywood agent, died just a few days before, drowned in her pool during an early- morning swim, the fifth woman in the class whose life has come to a sudden, mysterious end. </p><p> Also adding to Jean's sense of unease is a taunting, anonymous fax she has just received, referring to her daughter, Lily, a child she had given up for adoption twenty years ago, the offspring of a romance between her and a West Point cadet killed in an accident a week before graduation. She had always kept the child's existence a secret, so who has found out? And why the implied threat now? </p><p> Struggling to conceal her fears, Jean arrives at the hotel where the reunion is being held. One by one she sees the other honorees, including Laura Wilcox, the class beauty, whose dazzling exterior belies the fact that her television career is sinking, and the four men who, like Jean, had spent four bitterly unhappy years at Stonecroft: Carter (formerly Howie) Stewart, an acerbic and successful playwright, once the class nerd; renowned child psychiatrist and talk-show celebrity Mark Fleischman, who has never been able to resolve the pain of his own adolescence; Gordon Amory, a media mogul, hardly recognizable as the awkward boy who was the butt of cruel jokes; Robby Brent, a popular comedian, whose caustic humor emanates from a childhood of rejection. Omnipresent is an old classmate, Jack Emerson, the chairman of the reunion, whose reasons for spearheading the event may be motivated by something other than class spirit. </p><p> At the award dinner, Jean is introduced to Sam Deegan, a detective obsessed for years by the unsolved murder of a young woman in Cornwall, who may also hold the key to the identity of the Stonecroft killer and the source of the anonymous threat to her child. She does not suspect that among the distinguished people she is greeting is The Owl, a murderer nearing the countdown on his mission of vengeance against the Stonecroft women who had mocked and humiliated him, with Jean his final intended victim. </p><p> In <i>Nighttime Is My Time,</i> Mary Higgins Clark creates a riveting novel of psychological suspense, penetrating behind the pervading façade of status and respectability to depict the mind of a killer.</p>",3.82,434,Paperback, ,508,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41492.Nighttime_Is_My_Time,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41492.Nighttime_Is_My_Time

The story of the mythological king, who is doomed to kill his father and marry his mother, has resonated in world culture for almost 2,500 years. But Sophocles’ drama as originally performed was much more than a great story—it was a superb poetic script and exciting theatrical experience. The actors spoke in pulsing rhythms with hypnotic forward momentum, making it hard for audiences to look away. Interspersed among the verbal rants and duels were energetic songs performed by the chorus.</p><p>            David Mulroy’s brilliant verse translation of <i>Oedipus Rex</i> recaptures the aesthetic power of Sophocles’ masterpiece while also achieving a highly accurate translation in clear, contemporary English. Speeches are rendered with the same kind of regular iambic rhythm that gave the Sophoclean originals their drive. The choral parts are translated as fluid rhymed songs. Mulroy also supplies an introduction, notes, and appendixes to provide helpful context for general readers and students.</p><p> </p>",3.80,65,Paperback, ,42,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41674.Oedipus_Rex_and_Antigone,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41674.Oedipus_Rex_and_Antigone

Collier and Sons,eng,false,"<i>From the cover of the first edition:</i><br /><br />Into this great new novel--nearly twice as long as ""A Farewell to Arms""--Ernest Hemingway has poured the fullness of his experience, the perfection of his art. A novel of wartime Spain, in which a young American and a Spanish girl live a lifetime of love and courage in four momentous days, it speaks with final and unforgettable power for the truth--the truth of war and life in our time.<br /><br />With Robert Jordan already behind the enemy lines on his dangerous mission--to join forces with a band of Spanish men and women hidden in the mountains, and blow up a bridge that is essential to the great attack--the story begins in the midst of the action. It moves forward with rushing swiftness and a compelling sense of reality to the moment when he must blow up the bridge--the bridge on which the whole future of the human race can turn.<br /><br />Before this crucial action Robert Jordan enters into the life of the men and women whose destiny he shares, who living at the edge of danger, come vibrantly alive, intimately known. There is Pilar, a great woman who has lived long and fully, brave, barbarously outspoken, yet warmhearted; and Pablo, her husband, a strong man at the start of the movement but now dangerously undependable. And there is Maria, a tawny, lovely Spanish girl who escaped the tortures of the fascists to find healing in her love for Robert Jordan. Their story becomes one of the most tender, passionately moving love stories ever written.<br /><br />In these superbly real men and women--sharing days of heightened excitement, deeper and richer experiences than most lifetimes hold--Hemingway seems to have embraced all human experience, the conflict of life itself, not only martial but spiritual and emotional. All that he has written before--including some of the greatest novels of our generation--points toward the achievement of this work of art, a novel that carries the rare, perfected shine of enduring greatness.",3.97,503,Hardcover, ,37,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42425.For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42425.For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.<br /><br />""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. <br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. <br /><br />Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.",4.11, ,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42753.Angela_s_Ashes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42753.Angela_s_Ashes

This simple truth has already been revealed by such books as <i>The Nanny Diaries</i> and <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>, but for those who feel that the message bears repeating, Clare Naylor and Mimi Hare's <i>The Second Assistant: Tales from the Bottom of the Hollywood Ladder</i> offers yet another enjoyable (though fairly forgettable) lesson.<p> The heroine of this gossipy tale is Elizabeth Miller, a young, former campaign worker for a US congressman who finds herself between employment opportunities. Unable to obtain any more socially responsible work, Lizzie is lured into the job of second assistant to an executive at a glitzy Hollywood agency. Once there, she's hit with all the ""pick-up my dry cleaning,"" ""walk my dog,"" ""hire strippers for my party"" torment that the higher-ups can dish out. At first Elizabeth is isolated, out-of-place, and underdressed in her new world, but she makes friends, builds her wardrobe, and eventually grows to care for her menial job, her Ritalin-snorting boss, and the entertainment industry in general. Finally, she reaches the conclusion that thousands of other Californians have before her: what she really wants to do is produce. At times, Lizzie seems far too naïve to survive long in the shark-infested waters that the authors describe, but there can be only one kind of ending to such a light-hearted book, so we know she will somehow muddle through. Hare (who was once a Hollywood executive herself) and Naylor throw in a dreamy guy and a few plot twists that most readers could see coming from space, stir, and serve. Of course, a little frivolity is not a bad thing, and <i>The Second Assistant</i> is certainly an entertaining addition the new underling subgenre of modern fiction. <i>--Leah Weathersby</i></p>",3.54, ,Audio Cassette,Abridged,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42787.Uc_Second_Assistant_The_Abr_Cass,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42787.Uc_Second_Assistant_The_Abr_Cass

It's a unique style, possibly best suited to the world's weirder destinations. It's helpful here: Bryson's latest subject is that oddest of continents, Australia.<p> For a start, there's the oddly nasty fauna and flora. Barely a page of <i>Down Under</i> is without its lovingly detailed list of lethal antipodean critters: sociopathic jellyfish, homicidal crocs, toilet-dwelling death-spiders, murderous shrubs (yes, shrubs). Bryson's absorbing and informative portrait is of a terrain so intractably vast, a land so climatically extreme, it seems expressly designed to daunt and torment humankind. </p><p> This very user-unfriendliness throws up another Aussie paradox. If the country is so hostile how come the natives are so laid back, so relaxed? As Bryson shuffles from state to state, he seeks the key to the uniquely cool Australian character and finds it in Australia's tragicomic past, her genetic seeding of convicts, explorers, gold diggers, outlaws. This is a country of lads and mates, of boozy gamblers--nowadays mellowed by sunshine and sporting success.</p><p> <i>Down Under</i> is a fine book. So it may not be quite as deliciously malicious as Bryson's <i>The Lost Continent</i>, nor as laugh-out-loud funny as <i>Neither Here Nor There</i>. But so what?

Intrigued, the young Australian journalisted went to La Paz and joined one of Thomas's illegal tours. They formed an instant friendship and then became partners in an attempt to record Thomas's experiences in the jail. Rusty bribed the guards to allow him to stay and for the next three months he lived inside the prison, sharing a cell with Thomas and recording one of the strangest and most compelling prison stories of all time. The result is <i>Marching Powder</i>.<br /><br />This book establishes that San Pedro is not your average prison. Inmates are expected to buy their cells from real estate agents. Others run shops and restaurants. Women and children live with imprisoned family members. It is a place where corrupt politicians and drug lords live in luxury apartments, while the poorest prisoners are subjected to squalor and deprivation. Violence is a constant threat, and sections of San Pedro that echo with the sound of children by day house some of Bolivia's busiest cocaine laboratories by night. In San Pedro, cocaine--""Bolivian marching powder""--makes life bearable. Even the prison cat is addicted.<br /><br />Yet <i>Marching Powder</i> is also the tale of friendship, a place where horror is countered by humor and cruelty and compassion can inhabit the same cell.

It occurred, inevitably and temporarily, in the form of a capitalist economy and society, and it was also, perhaps, inevitable that it should occur in the form of a single ""liberal"" world economy, depending for a time on a single leading pioneer country. That country was Britain , and as such it stands alone in history. In his book E. J. Hobsbawm described and accounts for Britain's rise as the world's first industrial power, its decline from its temporary dominance, its rather special relationship with the rest of the world, and some of the effects of all of these on the life of the people of the country.<br /><br />The advantages of making an industrial revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were considerable, but between the 1860s and the end of the nineteenth the disadvantages began to emerge. Britain's decline can be traced to the early and long-sustained start as an industrial power, which, among other things, embedded an archaic technology and business structure which became difficult to abandon, or even modify. Also, Britain became the primary agency of economic interchange between the advanced and backward nations, and this dependence of the underdeveloped world on Britain left her with a line of retreat into Empire and Free Trade. Between the wars, the single liberal world economy, theoretically self-regulating, collapsed, and the accompanying world political system also began to collapse after the Russian revolution of 1917. Britain has adjusted to these major changes, but the big question still remains--can Britain fully adapt to the changed economic world of the second half of the twentieth century and maintain a position as a major economy? And if not, what are the alternatives?<br /><br /><i>Industry and Empire</i> is the provocative and stimulating companion volume to Christopher Hill's <i>Reformation to Industrial Revolution</i>.",3.94,411,Paperback, ,17,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43089.Industry_and_Empire,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43089.Industry_and_Empire

Since her 1994 debut with novels such as <i>Eden Close</i> and <i>Where or When</i>, Ms Shreve has come a long way, skilfully blending both historical and more up-to-date story-lines into her novels alongside recurrent themes that transcend time and place: love, loss and death. Long-time Shreve fans and newcomers alike will find <i>The Last Time They Met</i> a gripping read but it is also rather unusual as it features, as one of its two main protagonists, a minor character from a previous novel, <i>The Weight of Water</i>, and attempts to explain how and why he becomes the man he is. This is rather fascinating and if you've read the original novel in which Thomas, the alcoholic poet, features, you'll recognise him and feel immediately drawn to him. And if you haven't, by the end of this book, you'll want to read more. <p> <i>The Last Time They Met</i> is based on a tale of childhood sweethearts and a theme Shreve writes about so passionately and with such conviction one can't help wonder if she spends her nights dreaming of her first love. Ambitiously, she tells her tale of Thomas and his lover (Linda) from the present backwards, travelling from a poet's convention in Toronto via politically repressive Nairobi to Massachusetts and small-town 1960s' schooldays. The grand passions, the loveless marriages, abuse, lost children and, most heart-wrenchingly, the utterly wasted lives unfold majestically and with intense pathos. If the greatest test of a good book is not just that you can't put it down, but that it haunts your memory for far longer than it takes to read, then this is a cracking read with an end that will leave you reeling. --<i>Carey Green</i></p>",3.49,360,Paperback, ,33,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43145.The_Last_Time_They_Met,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43145.The_Last_Time_They_Met

But if <i>Visionaire</i> is a couture book, <i>V</i> is ready-to-wear--visually driven, international in scope, and collaborative in spirit. <i>V</i> is a magazine about fashion with a capital F, and all the things that go with it: art, music, film, architecture. Before <i>V</i> was put into print, the founders conceptualized it as a wall of 44 televisions, each tuned to a different station. Today you would need a wall of 250 televisions, but it's still a good way to think of the insane and unpredictable mix of people, places, and things that <i>V</i> celebrates in its pages. Here is a place where uptown meets downtown, celebrities mingle with total unknowns, high art converses with underground culture; all reflected through spreads, photography, and design. In the five years since its launch, <i>V</i> has grown up a lot, and the idea of grown-up and underground seems about as oxymoronic as wearing a thrift store T-shirt with an obscenely expensive designer bag. Which is to say, not at all. Chic, wacky, fun, fabulous . . . In a letter: V. The publication of <i>V Best</i> marks <i>V</i>'s fifth anniversary and while the editors like to think of every issue as an instant hit, they've taken the best-of-the-best from their archive, bringing together everything from fashion stories by contributors like Mario Testino, Inez Van Lamsweerde, Vinoodh Matadin, and Karl Lagerfeld, to talks with celebrities as diverse as Janet Jackson, Norman Mailer, Helmut Lang, Beyonc� Knowles, and David Bowie.

Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it.<br /><br />Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy.<br /><br />Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense.<br /><br />In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.",3.92,188,Hardcover, ,229,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43370.Thomas_Jefferson,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43370.Thomas_Jefferson

But do we know exactly what this book is? We do not. The original purpose of the collection was to introduce younger readers--high school and college-age people, more or less--to good writing from contemporary writers. But then the book came out and we discovered that the readership was not what we'd expected. Sure, there were some high school and college readers, but there were also older readers, and younger readers, and readers from every walk of life--police officers, firefighters, animal control experts, air-conditioning repair technicians, and prisoners. It runs the gamut.<br /> Now, your questions answered: <br />What is the purpose of this book? --Dominique, Santa Monica, CA Thank you for your question, Dominique. (Such a lovely name!) The purpose of this book is to collect good work of any kind--fiction, humor, essays, comics, journalism--in one place, for the English-reading consumer. The other books in the Best American series are limited by their categories, most particularly the popular but constraining Best American Catholic Badger Mystery Writing. This collection is not so limited, which is why, we think, it dominates all similar collections, making them whimper and cower in a way that is shameful. <br />Why aren't there more pieces about badgers? --Reginald, Myrtle Beach, SC We had plans to include at least seven pieces about badgers--their manufacture, appearance, and care--but were prevented from doing so by Zadie Smith. This was a condition of her inclusion in this volume. <br />In addition to the pieces included in the collection, and Ms. Smith's introduction--or whatever it is--will there be a piece by the editor about a young man with a crush on a sixty-five-year-old woman whose lawn he cuts? --Peter and Nam Mee, Washington, DC We might have such a piece. It might be immediately following this sentence. <br />(From the Foreword by Dave Eggers) <br />Since its inception in 1915, the Best American series has become the premier annual showcase for the country's finest short fiction and nonfiction. For each volume, the very best pieces are selected by an editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field, making the Best American series the most respected--and most popular--of its kind.<br /> Dave Eggers, who will be editing The Best American Nonrequired Reading annually, has once again chosen the best and least-expected fiction, nonfiction, satire, investigative reporting, alternative comics, and more from publications large, small, and on-line--The Onion, The New Yorker, Shout, Time, Zoetrope, Tin House, Nerve.com, and McSweeney's, to name just a few.

In <i>Dream Brother</i>, music critic David Browne offers an incisive portrait of the ill-fated father and son, examining their deaths and their short, though accomplished, careers. Browne's keen reporting and strong sense of the complex relationship between Jeff and Tim Buckley create a gripping account of a young artist hurtling toward his own destruction and a lyrical story of two lives adrift on the same churning river. Too discerning to simply attribute Jeff's death to some otherworldly, shared destiny with his father -- who died in 1975 at 28 -- the author instead paints a compelling picture of two valuable artists who never should have left the world so early. <i>Dream Brother</i> avoids dwelling on the similarities between father and son, but its focus on their individual paths makes the coincidences all the more haunting.<br /><p><br />Despite looking and sounding uncannily like a man who came a generation earlier, Jeff Buckley did not embrace his father's legacy. As Browne points out, the son was already without his father long before Tim's fatal heroin dose. For the rest of his life, Jeff resented his father for his absence and rejected the drug habit and self-destructive lifestyle that had ensnared Tim. And yet, both father and son possessed a daring that led them to premature, accidental deaths.<br /></p><p><br />Painting vivid images of the art and business of music in two very different eras, <i>Dream Brother</i> makes it clear that the common thread linking the deaths of Tim and Jeff Buckley is a sense of profound loss -- youth cut short, talent unexplored, music extinguished.<br /></p><p><br />Indeed, pervasive throughout <i>Dream Brother</i> is the feeling of something seductively ethereal. Maybe it's the presence of the Wolf River, which lured Jeff to his death. Maybe it's the foreknowledge of how the story will end. But probably, long after the Buckleys are gone, it's the music they left behind. <i>(Karen Burns)</i></p>",3.99,400,Paperback, ,70,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43588.Dream_Brother,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43588.Dream_Brother

What he got was a virtual cattle prod to the crotch, in the form of an impossible assignment delivered directly from the president's heroin-addict chief of staff. It seems the Constitution of the United States has some skeletons in its closet: the Founding Fathers doubted that the document would be able to stave off human nature indefinitely, so they devised a backup Constitution to deploy at the first sign of crisis. In the government's eyes, that time is now, as America is overgrown with perverts who spend more time surfing the Web for fetish porn than they do reading a newspaper. They want to use this ""Secret Constitution"" to drive the country back to a time when civility, God, and mom's homemade apple pie were all that mattered.<br /><br />The only problem is, no one can seem to find it . . .<br /><br />So who better to track it down than a private dick who's so down-and-out that he's coming up the other side, a shamus whose only skill is stumbling into every depraved situation imaginable?<br /><br />With no lead to speak of, and no knowledge of the underground world in which the Constitution has traveled, McGill embarks on a cross-country odyssey of America's darkest, dankest underbelly. Along the way, his white-bread sensibilities are treated to a smorgasbord of depravity that runs the gamut of human imagination. The filth mounts; it is clear that this isn't the kind of life, liberty, or happiness that Thomas Jefferson thought Americans would enjoy in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />But what McGill learns as he closes in on the real Constitution is that freedom takes many forms, the most important of which may be the fight against the ""good old days."" Like Vonnegut, Orwell, and Huxley before him, Warren Ellis deftly exposes the hypocrisy of the ""moral majority"" by giving us a glimpse at the monstrous outcome that their overzealous policies would achieve.",3.82,288,Hardcover, ,1002,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43717.Crooked_Little_Vein,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43717.Crooked_Little_Vein

Vampires are created--mortals succumbing to the sensation of ""being enptied, of being devoured, of being nothing."" Vampires are destroyed.  Dark rituals are performed--the rituals of ancient creatures prowling the modern world.  And, finally, we are brought to a moment in the twentieth century when, in an astonishing climax, the fate of the living dead--and perhaps of the living, all the living--will be decided.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.88,448,Paperback, ,1753,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43758.The_Queen_of_the_Damned,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43758.The_Queen_of_the_Damned

Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even ""settle down"" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.<br /><br />Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.<br /><br />Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion.

And what he finds leads him to a powerful family determined to keep an old secret, a disgraced reporter who may have plagiarized a novel to create a serial killer, a very interested FBI agent, and a missing child. <p> This is the seventh outing in a series that's been gaining in popularity since Bolitar's first appearance, in Harlan Coben's <i>Deal Breaker</i>.

But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz: a month later she was dead at the age of thirty-nine. Two years earlier, living in a small village in central France—where she, her husband, and their two small daughters had fled in a vain attempt to elude the Nazis—she'd begun her novel, a luminous portrayal of a human drama in which she herself would become a victim. When she was arrested, she had completed two parts of the epic, the handwritten manuscripts of which were hidden in a suitcase that her daughters would take with them into hiding and eventually into freedom. Sixty-four years later, at long last, we can read Némirovsky's literary masterpiece <br /><br />The first part, ""A Storm in June,"" opens in the chaos of the massive 1940 exodus from Paris on the eve of the Nazi invasion during which several families and individuals are thrown together under circumstances beyond their control. They share nothing but the harsh demands of survival—some trying to maintain lives of privilege, others struggling simply to preserve their lives—but soon, all together, they will be forced to face the awful exigencies of physical and emotional displacement, and the annihilation of the world they know.

Coexisting uneasily with the soldiers billeted among them, the villagers—from aristocrats to shopkeepers to peasants—cope as best they can.

Cooper details many of these meta functions to explain his central thesis: programmers need to seriously re-evaluate the many user-hostile concepts deeply embedded within the software development process.<p> Rather than provide users with a straightforward set of options, programmers often pile on the bells and whistles and ignore or de-prioritise lingering bugs. For the average user, increased functionality is a great burden, adding to the recurrent chorus that plays: ""computers are hard, mysterious, unwieldy things."" (An average user, Cooper asserts, who doesn't think that way or who has memorised all the esoteric commands and now lords it over others, has simply been desensitised by too many years of badly designed software.)</p><p> Cooper's writing style is often overblown, with a pantheon of cutesy terminology (i.e. ""dancing bearware"") and insider back-patting. (When presenting software to Bill Gates, he reports that Gates replied: ""How did you do that?"" to which he writes: ""I love stumping Bill!"") More seriously, he is also unable to see beyond software development's importance--a sin he accuses programmers of throughout the book.</p><p> Even with that in mind, the central questions Cooper asks are too important to ignore: Are we making users happier? Are we improving the process by which they get work done? Are we making their work hours more effective? Cooper looks to programmers, business managers and what he calls ""interaction designers"" to question current assumptions and mindsets. Plainly, he asserts that the goal of computer usage should be ""not to make anyone feel stupid."" Our distance from that goal reinforces the need to rethink entrenched priorities in software planning. -- <i>Jennifer Buckendorff, Amazon.com</i></p>",3.94,255,Paperback, ,157,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44098.The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44098.The_Inmates_Are_Running_the_Asylum

But McMurphy's revolution against Big Nurse and everything she stands for quickly turns from sport to a fierce power struggle with shattering results. <br /> With ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" Kesey created a work without precedent in American literature, a novel at once comic and tragic that probes the nature of madness and sanity, authority and vitality. Greeted by unanimous acclaim when it was first published, the book has become an enduring favorite of readers.

Second, carrying out such a change of variables frequently results in long and difficult calculations. In this book, first published in 2005, the author carefully discusses a calculus that allows the computational morass to be bypassed, and he goes on to develop more general forms of standard theorems, which help answer a wide range of problems involving boundary perturbations.

To some religious conservatives, McLaren is a dangerous rebel without a doctrinally-correct cause. Some fundamentalist websites have even claimed he's in league with the devil and have consigned him to flames.<br /><br />To others though, Brian is a fresh voice, a welcome antidote to the staleness, superficiality, and negativity of the religious status quo. A wide array of people from Evangelical, Catholic, and Mainline Protestant backgrounds claim that through his books they have begun to rediscover the faith they'd lost or rejected. And around the world, many readers say that he has helped them find-for the first time in their lives-a faith that makes sense and rings true.

To read Hesser's prose is to hunger for more.""—Nigella Lawson</b><br /><br /><i>Cooking for Mr. Latte</i> is a delightfully modern dating story, recipes included. It's the true story of the courtship between Amanda Hesser, a food writer for <i>The New York Times</i> and author of the award-winning cookbook <i>The Cook and the Gardener</i>, and writer Tad Friend, the titular Mr. Latte. Most of the book was written in installments for the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, but fans of Hesser's writing will be happy to know that there are plenty of new stories and recipes to justify picking up the book version. Her tale ends happily ever after, but has enough ups and downs to keep it interesting. And it's not all about Mr. Latte. Ever wonder what it's like to eat out with foodie guru Jeffrey Steingarten? Chances are you guessed wrong.<p> Food is an important aspect of Hesser's life (though it wasn't for Mr. Latte when they met, making for some of the downs in the ups and downs), but it's not until you notice how seamlessly Hesser weaves her meals into her story that you realize how much of our lives and our memories revolve around food. By the time you get to the recipes, you've already salivated over the dishes and become emotionally attached to them. From her mother's Chocolate Dump-It Cake to the Ginger Duck her future mother-in-law made the first time they met, you'll love that Hesser pays such close attention and generously shares the recipes. Filled with everything from old-fashioned treats from her grandmother's kitchen to dishes from some of New York's hottest dining spots, this is one entertaining read that is sure to end up in your kitchen. <i>--Leora Y.

""Self-Portrait"" reprints an interview she did in 1956 with <i>The Paris Review</i>, part of a famed ongoing series of conversations (""Writers at Work"") that the literary journal conducted with the best of twentieth-century writers.
