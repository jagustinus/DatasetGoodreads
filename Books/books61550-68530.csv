Kennedy. Carole Radziwill's story is part fairy tale, part tragedy. She tells both with great candor and wit. <p> Carole grew up in a small suburb with a large, eccentric cast of characters. She spent her childhood summers with her grandparents and an odd assortment of aunts and uncles in their poorly plumbed A-frame on the banks of a muddy creek in upstate New York. </p><p> At the age of nineteen, Carole struck out for New York City to find a different life. Her career at ABC News led her to the refugee camps of Cambodia, to a bunker in Tel Aviv, to the scene of the Menendez murders. Her marriage led her into the old world of European nobility and the newer world of American aristocracy. </p><p> <i>What Remains</i> begins with loss and returns to loss. A small plane plunges into the ocean, carrying John Kennedy, Anthony's cousin, and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, Carole's closest friend. Three weeks later Anthony dies of cancer. The summer of the plane crash, the four friends were meant to be cherishing Anthony's last days. Instead, Carole and Anthony mourned John and Carolyn, even as Carole planned her husband's memorial. </p><p> Carole Radziwill has an anthropologist's sensibility and a journalist's eye. She writes about families--their customs, their secrets, and their tangled intimacies-- with remarkable acuity and humanity. She explores the complexities of marriage, the importance of friendship, and the challenges of self-invention with unflinching honesty. This is a compelling story of love, loss, and, ultimately, resilience.</p>",4.18,404,Paperback, ,21,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61582.What_Remains,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61582.What_Remains

Tolkien created the extraordinary world of Middle-earth and populated it with fantastic, archetypal denizens, reinventing the heroic quest, the world hardly noticed. Sales of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> languished for the better part of two decades, until the Ballantine editions were published here in America. By late 1950s, however, the books were selling well and beginning to change the face of fantasy. . . . forever.<br /><br />A generation of students and aspiring writers had their hearts and imaginations captured by the rich tapestry of the Middle-earth mythos, the larger-than-life heroic characters, the extraordinary and exquisite nature of Tolkien's prose, and the unending quest to balance evil with good. These young readers grew up to become the successful writers of modern fantasy. They created their own worlds and universes, in some cases their own languages, and their own epic heroic quests. And all of them owe a debt of gratitude to the works and the author who first set them on the path.<br /><br /><i>In Meditations on Middle-earth</i>, sixteen bestselling fantasy authors share details of their personal relationships with Tolkien's mythos, for it inspired them all. Had there been no <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, there would also have been no <i>Earthsea</i> books by Ursula K. Le Guin; no <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> saga from George R. R. Martin; no <i>Tales of Discworld</i> from Terry Pratchett; no <i>Legends of Alvin Maker</i> from Orson Scott Card. Each of them was influenced by the master mythmaker, and now each reveals the nature of that influence and their personal relationships with the greatest fantasy novels ever written in the English language.<br /><br />If you've never read the Tolkien books, read these essays and discover the depthy and beauty of his work.

And from those men, Skorzeny is to select a smaller group, made up of the twenty most highly skilled commandos fluent in American culture, to attempt an even more sinister mission--the second objective--which, if completed, not only would change the course of the war, but would change the course of history.

De esta manera el argumento se rompe en multitud de pequeñas anécdotas. Lo importante es la suma de las mismas, que conforma un conjunto de vidas cruzadas, como las celdas de una colmena.<br /><br />El marco espacio-temporal es muy preciso: Madrid en unos días del año 1943, en plena posguerra. La historia se basa en un espacio novelesco reducido pero con bastantes personajes que intervienen poco en el transcurso de la obra y dan una visión social coral. De entre los trescientos personajes que aparecen, escasean tanto los de las clases más acomodadas como los de la clase obrera y sectores marginados, predominando la clase media baja, la pequeña burguesía venida a menos, cuyas ilusiones y proyectos de futuro son engañosos y cuyas miradas «jamás descubren horizontes nuevos», en una vida relatada como una «mañana eternamente repetida». La novela aparece como primera parte de una serie que había de llevar el título de «Caminos inciertos».<br /><br />La voluntad de reflejar con exactitud la realidad no supone la absoluta neutralidad del autor, que interviene de dos formas contradictorias.

The Emperor of Barrayar sends his newest imperial auditor, Lord Miles Vorkosigan, to find out why. The choice is not a popular one on Komarr, where a betrayal a generation before drenched the name of Vorkosigan in blood. Thus, the Komarrans surrounding Miles could be loyal subjects, potential hostages, innocent victims, or rebels ready for revenge. Lies within lies, treachery within treachery, Miles is caught in a race against time to stop a plot that could exile him from Barrayar forever.

Sogar in den Sprechblasen ist er hervorragend ohne Worte ausgekommen, als der Pinguin zweimal klopfte. Und nun sein erster Roman: Eine genial dicke Schwarte von 720 Seiten, in der ein Geistesblitz den nächsten jagt. Grün und gelb möchte man vor Neid werden: Wo hat der Mann bloß die vielen Ideen her? In seinen dreizehneinhalb Leben begegnet der Blaubär gehässigen Stollentrollen, unangenehmen Nattifftoffen, quasselnden Tratschwellen, durch die Wüste ziehenden Gimpeln, dem Wahnsinn, Fredda, der Berghutze -- eine Figur skurriler als die andere. Ab und an illustriert der Zeichner Moers die Gestalten des Erzählers Moers, ein Glücksfall natürlich, aber im Vordergrund steht der Text, unerschütterlich. Und hier entfaltet sich in vollen Zügen, was der eine oder andere bereits geahnt haben mag: Moers ist ein begnadeter, ironischer Erzähler.<p> Mit wieviel Sprachwitz er arbeitet, wie er an Ausdrücken feilt, Begegnungen verschachtelt komponiert, Satzrhythmen herstellt und wieder auflöst, das nötigt Respekt ab. Und man freut sich über die irrwitzigen Inhalte der Abenteuer. Ob er mit dem Rettungssaurier Mac als Navigator fliegt, eine Fata Morgana am Wüstenboden verklebt, durch Dimensionslöcher stürzt oder sich ein Duell mit dem Lügengladiator liefert: die Spannung bleibt ungebrochen (außer beim sechsten Kapitel), die unzähligen Geschichten sind unglaublich. Münchhausen entpuppt sich als blutiger Lehrling im Vergleich zu Moers.</p><p> Auch wenn sich beim Lesen gelegentlich Assoziationen zu Texten von Michael Ende oder Janosch einstellen mögen: Der Roman ist kein Kinderbuch, sondern nachdenklich machende (haben Sie schon mal über eine Tornado-Haltestelle nachgedacht?)

Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster. Leroux's work, with characters ranging from the spoiled prima donna Carlotta to the mysterious Persian from Erik's past, has been immortalized by memorable adaptations.

Then he gave the genre a darkly compelling contemporary twist in his trilogy of the Word and the Void. Last year, in Armageddon’s Children, Brooks undertook the stunning chronicle that united two unique worlds. Now that story of clashing forces of darkness and light, of Shannara’s beginnings and the human race’s possible end, marches forward into an unforgettable second volume full of mystery, magic, and momentous events.<br /><br />Across the ruined landscape that is America–hopelessly poisoned, plague-ridden, burned, and besieged by demon armies bent on exterminating all mortal life–two pilgrims have been summoned to serve the embattled cause of good. Logan Tom has journeyed to desolate Seattle to protect a ragged band of street urchins and the being known as “the gypsy morph,” who is both mortal and magical, and destined to save mankind unless he is destroyed. Likewise, Angel Perez has her own quest, one that will take her from the wreckage of Los Angeles to a distant, secret place untouched by the horrors of the nationwide blight–a place where the race of Elves has dwelled since before man existed. But close behind these lone Knights of the Word swarm the ravening forces of the Void. <br /><br />As the menacing thunder of war drums heralds the arrival of the demons and their brutal minions in Seattle, the young survivors who call themselves the Ghosts are forced to brave the dangerous world of gangs, mutants, and worse to escape the invasion. And Logan Tom must infiltrate a refugee compound to rescue Hawk, the leader of the street urchins, who has yet to learn the truth about who and what he is. Meanwhile, Angel Perez has joined an equally urgent mission: to find the Ellcrys, a fabled talisman crucial to protecting the Elven realm against an influx of unspeakable evil from the dread dimension known as the Forbidding. But Angel and her Elf allies must beware–for a demon spy, with a monstrous creature at its command, walks among them.<br /><br />As the legions of darkness draw the noose tighter, and the time of confrontation draws near, those chosen to defend the soul of the world must draw their battle lines and prepare to fight with, and for, their lives.

Loosely based on the author’s own life, it is the story of an orphaned young woman who leaves her small town to attend university in war-ravaged Barcelona.<br /><br />Residing amid genteel poverty in a mysterious house on Calle de Aribau, young Andrea falls in with a wealthy band of schoolmates who provide a rich counterpoint to the squalor of her home life. As experience overtakes innocence, Andrea gradually learns the disquieting truth about the people she shares her life with: her overbearing and superstitious aunt Angustias; her nihilistic yet artistically gifted uncle Román and his violent brother Juan; and Juan’s disturbingly beautiful wife, Gloria, who secretly supports the clan with her gambling. From existential crisis to a growing maturity and resolve, Andrea’s passionate inner journey leaves her wiser, stronger, and filled with hope for the future.<br /><br />The incomparable Edith Grossman’s vital new translation captures the feverish energy of Laforet’s magnificent story, showcasing its dark, powerful imagery, and its subtle humor.

Se presenta como el profeta supremo, superior en sabiduria y conocimiento al resto de los humanos. Nietzsche lo emplea como contraposicion a la doctrina de la Iglesia catolica, a la que considera heredera de Socrates en cuanto a la manera de entender la vida. Zaratustra fue escogido por el autor como ejemplo de la filosofia presocratica, para explicar su teoria del Ubermensch (superhombre o suprahombre), vitalista y naturalista, y para reivindicar la aceptacion de los aspectos negativos y positivos de la vida. En definitiva, para proponer una actitud de aceptacion de la vida en su plenitud y negacion del mas alla, que en su opinion era la causa de la debilidad humana. Zaratustra es un ermitano que vive recluido en la montana, donde a lo largo de su retiro reflexiona sobre la vida y la naturaleza del hombre. Una vez siente que es el momento adecuado, decide regresar al mundo para comunicarle el fruto de su conocimiento.

Natürlich drängt sich bei diesem Timing der Verdacht auf, es ginge dem unlängst geschassten Chefredakteur des Nachrichtenmagazins <i>Der Spiegel</i> darum, beflügelt vom Hype um den Film noch einmal kräftig Kasse zu machen. Doch die Anschaffung des inzwischen auf knapp 900 Seiten angewachsenen Opus Magnus von Aust lohnt sich tatsächlich!<p> Nicht umsonst galt Austs ebenso präzise wie unvoreingenommene Chronik der Ereignisse vom Juni 1967 bis zum ""Deutschen Herbst&amp;"" 1977 schon bald nach Erscheinen der Erstauflage als Standardwerk. Die Eliminierung von Fehlern, die Anreicherung mit weiteren Details und die Illustration mit Fotos, die der Autor für die dritte Ausgabe geleistet hat, wird diesen Anspruch sicherlich weiter zementieren. Erstehanderfahrungen und die persönliche Bekanntschaft mit etlichen Akteuren der RAF und deren Umfeld machten das Buch seit jeher so einzigartig und authentisch. Dabei hat es der Sache nur wenig Abbruch getan, dass Aust, der sich seine ersten Sporen noch unter der Ägide von Ulrike Meinhof bei der linksradikalen Postille <i>Konkret</i> verdiente, mit dem Verdikt des Revisionisten und Karrieristen im inneren Zirkel der RAF stets auf eine Mauer des Schweigens stieß. Durchbrochen lediglich von einer Handvoll Renegaten, die sich vor allzu unvorsichtigen Äußerungen freilich gehütet haben dürften, um ihre Bewährung nicht zu gefährden.</p><p> Vor allem im Umgang mit ihnen und den offiziellen Quellen, die noch immer weit davon entfernt sind, ungefiltert zu sprudeln, ist investigatives Gespür gefragt. Und über ein solches verfügt der alte Hase des Enthüllungsjournalismus zweifellos in einem weit höheren Maße als die meisten anderen Publizisten, die sich in den letzten Jahrzehnten mit der RAF auseinandergesetzt haben. Trugen bei der Neuausgabe von 1997 vor allem Unterlagen des Ministeriums für Staatssicherheit (MfS) sowie Aussagen einiger in der DDR untergetauchter RAF-Mitglieder zur weiteren Erhellung des dunkelsten Kapitels der deutschen Nachkriegsgeschichte bei, so kreist Austs Spot diesmal über den zwielichtigen Machenschaften westdeutscher Geheimdienstler, die er schon in seiner TV-Dokumentation beleuchtete.

But his nights have come to revolve around his mother’s increasingly disturbing bedside stories full of old family bitterness.

In one of the most miraculous events of the century, the oppressive system of apartheid was dismantled. Repressive laws mandating separation of the races were thrown out. The country, which had been carved into a crazy quilt that reserved the most prosperous areas for whites and the most desolate and backward for blacks, was reunited. The dreaded and dangerous security force, which for years had systematically tortured, spied upon, and harassed people of color and their white supporters, was dismantled. But how could this country--one of spectacular beauty and promise--come to terms with its ugly past? How could its people, whom the oppressive white government had pitted against one another, live side by side as friends and neighbors?<br /><br />To begin the healing process, Nelson Mandela created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by the renowned cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Established in 1995, the commission faced the awesome task of hearing the testimony of the victims of apartheid as well as the oppressors. Amnesty was granted to those who offered a full confession of any crimes associated with apartheid. Since the commission began its work, it has been the central player in a drama that has riveted the country. In this book, Antjie Krog, a South African journalist and poet who has covered the work of the commission, recounts the drama, the horrors, the wrenching personal stories of the victims and their families. Through the testimonies of victims of abuse and violence, from the appearance of Winnie Mandela to former South African president P. W. Botha's extraordinary courthouse press conference, this award-winning poet leads us on an amazing journey.<br /><br /><b>Country of My Skull</b> captures the complexity of the Truth Commission's work. The narrative is often traumatic, vivid, and provocative. Krog's powerful prose lures the reader actively and inventively through a mosaic of insights, impressions, and secret themes. This compelling tale is Antjie Krog's profound literary account of the mending of a country that was in colossal need of change.",4.09,432,Paperback, ,187,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63675.Country_of_My_Skull,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63675.Country_of_My_Skull

She is the last defender of the Celtic culture in Britain; the only woman openly to lead her warriors into battle and to stand successfully against the might of Imperial Rome—and triumph.<br /><br />It is 33 AD and eleven-year-old Breaca (later named Boudica), the red-haired daughter of one of the leaders of the Eceni tribe, is on the cusp between girl and womanhood. She longs to be a Dreamer, a mystical leader who can foretell the future, but having killed the man who has attacked and killed her mother, she has proven herself a warrior. <b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is also the story of the two men Boudica loves most: Caradoc, outstanding warrior and inspirational leader; and Bàn, her half-brother, who longs to be a warrior, though he is manifestly a Dreamer, possibly the finest in his tribe’s history. Bàn becomes the Druid whose eventual return to the Celts is Boudica’s salvation.<br /><br /><b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> is full of brilliantly realised, luminous scenes as the narrative sweeps effortlessly from the epic—where battle scenes are huge, bloody, and action-packed—to the intimate. Manda Scott plunges us into the unforgettable world of tribal Britain in the years before the Roman invasion: a world of druids and dreamers and the magic of the gods where the natural world is as much a character as any of the people who live within it, a world of warriors who fight for honour as much as victory, a world of passion, courage and spectacular heroism pitched against overwhelming odds.<br /><br /><b>Dreaming the Eagle</b> stunningly recreates the roots of a story so powerful its impact has lasted through the ages.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",4.06,496,Paperback, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63736.Dreaming_the_Eagle,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63736.Dreaming_the_Eagle

Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found.<br /><br />Dividing the Disciplines into three movements of the Spirit, Foster shows how each of these areas contribute to a balanced spiritual life. The inward Disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward Disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service help prepare us to make the world a better place. The corporate Disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration bring us nearer to one another and to God.<br /><br />Foster provides a wealth of examples demonstrating how these Disciplines can become part of our daily activities—and how they can help us shed our superficial habits and ""bring the abundance of God into our lives."" He offers crucial new insights on simplicity, demonstrating how the biblical view of simplicity, properly understood and applied, brings joy and balance to our inward and outward lives and ""sets us free to enjoy the provision of God as a gift that can be shared with others.""

But at least it's an escape from scheming Nanny Ogg and old Granny Weatherwax back home, who want her to join their witchy ranks.<br /><br />Once Granny sets her mind on something, however, it's difficult -- and often hazardous -- to dissuade her. And no opera-prowling phantom fiend is going to keep a pair of determined hags down on the farm after they've seen Ankh-Morpork.",4.07,358,Mass Market Paperback, ,75,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64219.Maskerade,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64219.Maskerade

Its form, the cartoon, succeeds perfectly in shocking us out of any lingering sense of familiarity with the events described, approaching, as it does, the unspeakable through the diminutive. It is, as the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> has commented, ""a remarkable feat of documentary detail and novelistic vividness...an unfolding literary event.""<br /><br />Moving back and forth from Poland to Rego Park, New York, <i>Maus</i> tells two powerful stories: the first is Spiegelman's father's account of how he and his wife survived Hitler's Europe, a harrowing tale filled with countless brushes with death, improbable escapes, and the terror of confinement and betrayal. The second is the author's tortured relationship with his aging father as they try to lead a normal life of minor arguments and passing visits against a backdrop of history too large to pacify. At all levels, this is the ultimate survivor's tale - and that, too, of the children who somehow survive even the survivors.<br /><br />Part I of <i>Maus</i> takes Spiegelman's parents to the gates of Auschwitz and him to the edge of despair.

Though ordinary in appearance, it first captures the eye of the narrator of François Cheng's novel. Then, once he begins to read, it captures his imagination and his heart. The book dates from the mid-seventeenth century, during the twilight of the Ming Dynasty. Barbarian armies are massing along the Empire's Northern borders, and a vast and sophisticated civilization-during whose heyday China had begun to emerge from its long isolation and undergone an explosion in the arts equal in its way to Europe's Renaissance-teeters on the brink of monumental and perhaps catastrophic change. Yet rather than filled with lore of military heroism, or with tales of palace intrigue, or with nostalgic memories of better days, the book tells a simple and very powerful love story.<br /><br />It opens to a spring day, when a middle-aged doctor named Dao-sheng leaves the mountaintop Taoist monastery where he has been living and sets out for the Region of the South, to the city he had once visited thirty years earlier and where his life had been irrevocably changed. He had then been a strapping but poor young musician traveling with theater troupe. One evening, during a performance, he caught the eye of well-born young woman named Lan-ying. Their contact lasted but a minute, but to them it felt like an eternity. For this act of audacity he was banished to hard labor by the girl's jealous fiancée, the dissipated scion of a powerful family, who had witnessed their exchange and grasped its significance. Across the decades of a life spent either on the run or hiding out in monasteries, where he mastered medicine and divination, Dao-sheng never forgot Lan-ying. One exchange of glances had sealed something forever, something whose enduring power would decide their fates.<br /><br />Written with radiant simplicity and wisdom, simultaneously heartbreaking and heart-warming, <i>Green Mountain, White Cloud</i> is a suspenseful tale of passion and revenge set against the backdrop of a great empire's last days. François Cheng gives us star-crossed lovers whose rekindled passion makes the pages of this novel glow. More than a love story, it takes us on a quest as much spiritual as physical, exploring the very essence of love's ageless and transformative power.<br />",3.78,224,Hardcover, ,7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64324.Green_Mountain_White_Cloud,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64324.Green_Mountain_White_Cloud

Within this broader disintegration is another, that of a single human being, Private Tamura. The war destroys each of his ties to society, one by one, until Tamura, a sensitive and intelligent man, becomes an outcast.<br /><br />Nearly losing the will to survive, he hears of a port still in Japanese hands and struggles to walk through the American lines. Unfazed by danger, he welcomes the prospect of dying, but first, he loses his hope, and then his sanity. Lost among his hallucinations, Tamura comes to fancy himself an angel enjoined by God to eat no living thing—but even angels fall.<br /><br />Tamura is never less than human, even when driven to the ultimate sin against humanity.

In <b>Mainlines, Blood Feasts, Bad Taste</b> fellow rock critic John Morthland has compiled a companion volume to <b>Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung</b>, the first, now classic collection of Bangs’s work. Here are excerpts from an autobiographical piece Bangs wrote as a teenager, travel essays, and, of course, the music pieces, essays, and criticism covering everything from titans like Miles Davis, Lou Reed, and the Rolling Stones to esoteric musicians like Brian Eno and Captain Beefheart.

No writer on rock ‘n’ roll ever lived harder or wrote better–more passionately, more compellingly, more penetratingly. He lived the rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle, guzzling booze and Romilar like water, matching its energy in prose that erupted from the pages of <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Creem</em>, and <em>The Village Voice</em>. Bangs agitated in the seventies for sounds that were harsher, louder, more electric, and more alive, in the course of which he charted and defined the aesthetics of heavy metal and punk. He was treated as a peer by such brash visionaries as Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, Captain Beefheart, The Clash, Debbie Harry, and other luminaries.<br /><br /><em>Let it Blurt</em> is a scrupulously researched account of Lester Bangs’s fascinating (if often tawdry and unappetizing) life story, as well as a window on rock criticism and rock culture in their most turbulent and creative years. It includes a never-before-published piece by Bangs, the hilarious ""How to Be a Rock Critic,"" in which he reveals the secrets of his dubious, freeloading trade.",3.90,352,Paperback, ,81,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64669.Let_it_Blurt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64669.Let_it_Blurt

Like a Wu Li Master who would teach us wonder for the falling petal before speaking of gravity, Zukav writes in beautifully clear language—with no mathematical equations—opening our minds to the exciting new theories that are beginning to embrace the ultimate nature of our universe...Quantum mechanics, relativity, and beyond to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect and Bell's theorem.<br /><br />At an Esalen Institute meeting in 1976, tai chi master Al Huang said that the Chinese word for physics is Wu Li, ""patterns of organic energy."" Journalist Gary Zukav and the others present developed the idea of physics as the dance of the Wu Li Masters--the teachers of physical essence. Zukav explains the concept further: The Wu Li Master dances with his student. The Wu Li Master does not teach, but the student learns. The Wu Li Master always begins at the center, the heart of the matter.... This book deals not with knowledge, which is always past tense anyway, but with imagination, which is physics come alive, which is Wu Li.... Most people believe that physicists are explaining the world. Some physicists even believe that, but the Wu Li Masters know that they are only dancing with it. The ""new physics"" of Zukav's 1979 book comprises quantum theory, particle physics, and relativity. Even as these theories age they haven't percolated all that far into the collective consciousness; they're too far removed from mundane human experience not to need introduction.

Or so it seemed until his former insurance agent spotted him in the bar of a dusty little resort halfway between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.<br /><br /><i>""In truth, the facts about Wendell Jaffe had nothing to do with my family history, but murder is seldom tidy and no one ever said revelations operate in a straight line. It was my investigation into the dead man's past that triggered the inquiry into my own, and in the end the two stories became difficult to separate.""</i><br /><br />Five years ago, when Jaffe's thirty-five-foot Fuji ketch was found drifting off the Baja coast, it seemed a sure thing he'd gone overboard. The note he left behind admitted he was flat broke, his business bankrupt, his real estate gambit nothing but a huge Ponzi scheme about to collapse, with criminal indictment certain to follow. When the authorities soon after descended on his banks and his books, there was nothing left: Jaffe had stripped the lot.<br /><br /><i>""Given my insatiable curiosity and my natural inclination to poke my nose in where it doesn't belong, it was odd to realize how little attention I'd paid to my own past. I'd simply accepted what I was told, constructing my personal mythology on the flimsiest of facts.""</i><br /><br />But Jaffe wasn't quite without assets. There was the $500,000 life insurance policy made out to his wife and underwritten by California Fidelity. With no corpse to prove death, however, the insurance company was in no hurry to pay the claim. Dana Jaffe had to wait out the statutory five years until her missing husband could be declared legally dead. Just two months before Wendell Jaffe was sighted in that dusty resort bar, California Fidelity finally paid in full. Now they wanted the truth. And they were willing to hire Kinsey Millhone to dig it up.<br /><br />As Kinsey pushes deeper into the mystery surrounding Wendell Jaffe's pseudocide, she explores her own past, discovering that in family matters as in crime, sometimes it's better to reserve judgment.<br /><br />""J"" is for judgment: the kind we're quick to make and often quicker to regret.<br /><br /><i>""J"" Is for Judgment</i>: Kinsey Millhone's tenth excursion into the dark places of the heart where duplicity is the governing rule and murder the too-frequent result.",4.02, , , ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64944.J_is_for_Judgment,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64944.J_is_for_Judgment

Dubbed ""Bitter Bierce"" for his vitriolic wit and biting satire, his fame rests largely on a celebrated compilation of barbed epigrams, <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i>, and a book of short stories (<i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i>, 1891). Most of the 16 selections in this volume have been taken from the latter collection.<br />The stories in this edition include: ""What I Saw at Shiloh,"" ""A Son of the Gods,"" ""Four Days in Dixie,"" ""One of the Missing,"" ""A Horseman in the Sky,"" ""The Coup de Grace,"" ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" ""The Story of Conscience,"" ""One Kind of Officer,"" ""Chickamauga,"" and five more.<br />Bierce's stories employ a buildup of suggestive realistic detail to produce grim and vivid tales often disturbing in their mood of fatalism and impending calamity. Hauntingly suggestive, they offer excellent examples of the author's dark pessimism and storytelling power.<br /><br /><br />--back cover<br /><br />Contents:<br />1	What I Saw of Shiloh<br />2	Four Days in Dixie<br />3	A Horseman in the Sky<br />4	An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge<br />5	Chickamauga<br />6	A Son of the Gods<br />7	One of the Missing<br />8	Killed at Resaca<br />9	The Affair at Coulter's Notch<br />10	The Coup de Grâce<br />11	Parker Adderson, Philosopher<br />12	An Affair of Outposts<br />13	The Story of a Conscience<br />14	One Kind of Officer<br />15	George Thurston<br />16	The Mocking-bird",3.92,127,Paperback,Dover Thrift Editions (US/CAN/UK),63,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65264.Civil_War_Stories,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65264.Civil_War_Stories

At the center of the narrative is the character of Vishnu, an aging alcoholic houseboy on the precipice of death, who lies, penniless, on the bottom step of a middle-class Bombay apartment house. While Vishnu appears to face his impending death placidly and philosophically, a maelstrom swirls around him. The residents of the building include a reclusive widower mourning the untimely death of his young wife, a Moslem family coping with the daily prejudices of their Hindu neighbors, and two families who unhappily share a kitchen. Worlds collide when the Moslem family's son elopes with the Hindu family's daughter, and Mr. Jalal, the Moslem family patriarch, apparently flips his wig, recognizing Vishnu not as their dying houseboy but as the deity whose name he bears, with the power to save. And when Mr. Jalal is found sleeping on the stairs beside Vishnu, he becomes the scapegoat for the building's many ills. In its frenetic and hilarious conclusion, <i>The Death of Vishnu</i> trumpets the arrival of an extremely gifted Indian writer, bringing to spectacular life the tempestuous chaos that is life in India today. <br />(<i>Winter 2001 Selection</i>)",3.62,301,Paperback, ,485,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65285.The_Death_of_Vishnu,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65285.The_Death_of_Vishnu

Their cosy domestic scenario undergoes great upheaval with the introduction of the vivacious Binodini, a young, attractive widow who comes to live with them. Asha and Binodini become bosom pals. Binodini is initially drawn to Bihari but then begins to respond to the advances of Mahendra, who has become obsessively attracted to her.

Some of the intangible channels to creativity explored in the book include fantasy, metaphor, the paradoxical and metaphysical, the primordial and untouched, poetry and literature, and the exotic and multicultural. Among the tangible channels covered are history and the study of precedents, mimesis and literal interpretation, geometry, materials, and the role of nature. The author presents rich and imaginative discussions of these various channels, explaining which were favored during the Modern and Postmodern movements and clarifying his theoretical analyses through the use of many vivid examples, tables, and illustrations. Included among the examples in the volume are many distinguished projects and theories by a wide range of noted architects such as Asplund, Aalto, Utzon, Pikionis, Barragin, Pietila, Predock, and Legorreta, who are latecomers to the attention of the media. Antoniades also provides fascinating material on the study of architectural biographies as a means of achieving an all-inclusive creativity in architectural design. Highly original yet based on solid principles, Poetics of Architecture will help architects, designers, and students increase their versatility and creativity in the studio. It will also deepen their understanding and appreciation of the creative process and its many influences.",4.15,320,Paperback, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66445.Poetics_of_Architecture,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66445.Poetics_of_Architecture

In the Sense of Unity, a handsomely illustrated volume and the first extended work of its kind, Nader Ardalan and Laleh Bakhtiar examine the architecture of Persia as a manifestation of Islamic tradition and demonstrate the synthesis of traditional Persian thought and form. The most fundamental principle of Sufism, the inner, esoteric dimension of Islam, is that of unity in multiplicity. This view sees in every aspect of reality a reflection of a transcendent source which is given symbolic expression through all of man's activities, most directly and importantly through his works of art. The authors of The Sense of Unity show how all the elements of the Islamic architecture of Persiafrom the simplest architectural unit to a complex urban environmentare woven around this central doctrine and thus are best understood as multiple manifestations of unity. The Sense of Unity is illustrated with photographs, drawing, charts, and tables which are an integral part of its argument and which exemplify, in abundant and striking detail, the principles discussed in the text. Presenting to the Western reader for the first time the insights of the Iranian cultural tradition, the book also offers a stimulating new way of thinking about man and his relationship to his milieu.",4.52,151,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66462.The_Sense_of_Unity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66462.The_Sense_of_Unity

He looks at the theological origins of political Islam and takes us through the rise of militant Islam in Iran, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, examining the impact of radical Wahhabi proselytizing, and Saudi oil money, on the rest of the Islamic world. <br /><br /><b>The Crisis of Islam</b> ranges widely through thirteen centuries of history, but in particular it charts the key events of the twentieth century leading up to the violent confrontations of today: the creation of the state of Israel, the Cold War, the Iranian Revolution, the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan, the Gulf War, and the September 11th attacks on the United States.<br /><br />While hostility toward the West has a long and varied history in the lands of Islam, its current concentration on America is new. So too is the cult of the suicide bomber. Brilliantly disentangling the crosscurrents of Middle Eastern history from the rhetoric of its manipulators, Bernard Lewis helps us understand the reasons for the increasingly dogmatic rejection of modernity by many in the Muslim world in favor of a return to a sacred past.

Il n'y a que peu à dire de sa vie extérieure. Son indépendance intellectuelle, sa modestie, sa pureté d'âme lui ont fait choisir en effet l'existence effacée et les souffrances d'un être d'élite qui se refuse aux compromis. Sa grande douceur de cœur, un esprit toujours prompt à saisir le ridicule des choses, son indulgence aussi pour ceux qu'il aimait, tempéraient seuls son mépris de ce monde. Formé à la lecture des maîtres modernes de l'Europe, mais également pénétré d'un profond amour pour le folklore et les traditions de sa patrie, S. Hedayat a cherché son inspiration auprès du peuple de l'Iran. Cependant, la passion avec laquelle l'écrivain s'est penché sur les religions de la Perse antique et sur les superstitions et les pratiques de magie populaire qui en dérivent, a éveillé aussi chez lui le goût de l'insolite et, bien souvent, il écarte les étroites barrières de la réalité, pour laisser le merveilleux envahir la vie de ses personnages : l'action d'un roman comme La Chouette aveugle se situe très loin de l'espace et du temps ordinaires. Comme les plus grands poètes de sa race - on songe à Omar Khayam, le seul, d'ailleurs, qu'il aimait - S. Hédayat est un pessimiste. C'est un regard désespéré qu'il promène sur le monde. Cet univers aux lois impénétrables, mais absurdes et cruelles, s'il entr'ouvre parfois devant nous ses cercles les plus fantastiques, loin de nous offrir alors la promesse d'une destinée meilleure au-delà de l'existence terrestre, nous apparaît toujours baigné de la même sinistre lumière. Rien à espérer de cette vie, rien non plus d'une autre. Telle est l'obsession que l'on retrouve à chaque ligne de La Chouette aveugle.",3.99,195,Paperback, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66607.La_Chouette_aveugle,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66607.La_Chouette_aveugle

Una documentación que pone al descubierto multitud de datos nuevos sobre la figura y obra de Jesús de Nazaret. Podemos asegurar que -tal y como sospecha buena parte de la Humanidad- las grandes potencias ocultan muchos de sus proyectos espaciales y militares, y ""Caballo de Troya"" es una prueba más de ello.<br />Podemos revelar, por ejemplo, que en 1973 las fuerzas aéreas norteamericanas, después de varios años de preparación y tras un sinfín de peripecias, ejecutaron en pleno corazón de Israel uno de sus proyectos ""supersecretos"" que fue bautizado, precisamente, como ""Operación Caballo de Troya"". Pero no podemos avanzar al lector cómo se consiguió esa fascinante documentación ""confidencial"" por parte de J.J. Benitez, ni tampoco el asombroso desarrollo de la referida operación y su desconcertante final.

In ""Stone Animals,"" a house's haunting takes the unusual form of hordes of rabbits that camp out nightly on the front lawn. This proves just one of several benign but inexplicable phenomena that begin to pull apart the family newly moved into the house as surely as a more sinister supernatural influence might. The title story beautifully captures the unpredictable potential of teenage lives through its account of a group of adolescent schoolfriends whose experiences subtly parallel events in a surreal TV fantasy series. Zombies serve as the focus for a young man's anxieties about his future in ""Some Zombie Contingency Plans"" and offer suggestive counterpoint to the lives of two convenience store clerks who serve them in ""The Hortlak.""

Semiology, therefore aims to take in any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not <i>languages</i>, at least systems of signification . . . The <i>Elements</i> here presented have as their sole aim the extraction from linguistics of analytical concepts which we think <i>a priori</i> to be sufficiently general to start semiological research on its way. In assembling them, it is not presupposed that they will remain intact during the course of research; nor that semiology will always be forced to follow the linguistic model closely. We are merely suggesting and elucidating a terminology in the hope that it may enable an initial (albeit provisional) order to be introduced into the heterogeneous mass of significant facts. In fact what we purport to do is furnish a principle of classification of the questions. These elements of semiology will therefore be grouped under four main headings borrowed from structural linguistics: I. <i>Language and Speech</i>; II. <i>Signified and Signifier</i>; III. <i>Syntagm and System;</i> IV. <i>Denotation and Connotation</i>.""--Roland Barthes, from his Introduction",3.81,112,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66703.Elements_of_Semiology,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66703.Elements_of_Semiology

As Spanish blood spills into the Flemish canals, and the lethal flash of swordplay drains the men of their thirst for victory, unrest grows among the troops.

Barks's translations capture the inward exploration and intensity that characterize Rumi's poetry, making this unique voice of mysticism and desire contemporary while remaining true to the original poems. In this volume readers will encounter the essence of Sufism's insights into the experience of divine love, wisdom, and the nature of both humanity and God.<br /><br />While Barks's stamp on this collection is clear, it is Rumi's voice that leaps off these pages with a rapturous power that leaves readers breathless. These poems express our deepest yearning for the transcendent connection with the source of the divine: there are passionate outbursts about the torment of longing for the beloved and the sweet delight that comes from union; stories of sexual adventures and of loss; poems of love and fury, sadness and joy; and quiet truths about the beauty and variety of human emotion. For Rumi, soul and body and emotion are not separate but are rather part of the great mystery of mortal life, a riddle whose solution is love. Above all else, Rumi's poetry exposes us to the delight that comes from being fully alive, urging us always to put aside our fears and take the risk of discovering our core self:<br /><br /><em>No one knows what makes the soul wake up so happy! Maybe a dawn breeze has blown the veil from the face of God.</em> These fresh, original translations magnificently convey Rumi's insights into the human heart and its longings with his signature passion and daring, focusing on the ecstatic experience of the inseparability of human and divine love. The match between Rumi's sublime poetry and Coleman Barks's poetic art are unequaled, and here this artistic union is raised to new heights.",4.49,425,Paperback, ,121,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67375.The_Soul_of_Rumi,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67375.The_Soul_of_Rumi

This global democratic revolution is probably the most important political trend in the late twentieth century. In <em>The</em> <em>Third Wave, </em>Samuel P. Huntington analyzes the causes and nature of these democratic transitions, evaluates the prospects for stability of the new democracies, and explores the possibility of more countries becoming democratic. The recent transitions, he argues, are the third major wave of democratization in the modem world. Each of the two previous waves was followed by a reverse wave in which some countries shifted back to authoritarian government. Using concrete examples, empirical evidence, and insightful analysis, Huntington provides neither a theory nor a history of the third wave, but an explanation of why and how it occurred.<br /><br /><br />Factors responsible for the democratic trend include the legitimacy dilemmas of authoritarian regimes; economic and social development; the changed role of the Catholic Church; the impact of the United States, the European Community, and the Soviet Union; and the ""snowballing"" phenomenon: change in one country stimulating change in others. Five key elite groups within and outside the nondemocratic regime played roles in shaping the various ways democratization occurred. Compromise was key to all democratizations, and elections and nonviolent tactics also were central. New democracies must deal with the ""torturer problem"" and the ""praetorian problem"" and attempt to develop democratic values and processes. Disillusionment with democracy, Huntington argues, is necessary to consolidating democracy. He concludes the book with an analysis of the political, economic, and cultural factors that will decide whether or not the third wave continues.<br /><br /><br />Several ""Guidelines for Democratizers"" offer specific, practical suggestions for initiating and carrying out reform. Huntington's emphasis on practical application makes this book a valuable tool for anyone engaged in the democratization process. At this volatile time in history, Huntington's assessment of the processes of democratization is indispensable to understanding the future of democracy in the world.",3.64,384,Paperback, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67471.The_Third_Wave,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67471.The_Third_Wave

But he becomes uneasy after finding an anonymous love letter hidden in his daughter's room: ""No one could ever love you like I do. No one ever will. We will be together forever. One way or another."" But the reality of Ashley's plight far exceeds Scott's worst suspicions. <br />One drink too many had led Ashley, a beautiful, bright art student, into what she thought was just a fling with a blue-collar bad boy. But now, no amount of pleading or reasoning can discourage his phone calls, ardent e-mails, and constant, watchful gaze. <br />Michael O'Connell is but a malignant shadow of a man. His brash, handsome features conceal a black and empty soul. Control is his religion. Cunning and criminal skill are his stock-in-trade. Rage is his language. <br />The harder Ashley tries to break free, the deeper Michael burrows into every aspect of her life, so she turns in desperation to her divorced parents and her mother's new partner-three people still locked in a coldly civilized triangle of resentment. But their fierce devotion to Ashley is the common bond that will draw them together to face down a predator. <br />For Ashley's family, it is a test of primal love that will drive them to the extreme edge-and beyond-in a battle of wills that escalates into a life-or-death war to protect their own. <br />From the bestselling master of suspense, John Katzenbach, The ""Wrong Man"" is an elegantly crafted and breathtakingly intense read that asks the question, ""How far would you go to save the child you love?""",3.82,461,Hardcover, ,112,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67930.The_Wrong_Man,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67930.The_Wrong_Man

Yet its improbable creation was difficult, torturous...and at times nothing short of dangerous.In self-imposed exile, the Stones-along with wives, girlfriends, and a crew of hangers-on unrivaled in the history of rock-spent their days smoking, snorting, and drinking whatever they could get their hands on. At night, the band descended like miners into the villa’s dank basement to lay down tracks. Out of those grueling sessions came the familiar riffs and rhythms of “Rocks Off,” “Tumbling Dice,” “Happy,” and “Sweet Virginia.” All the while, a variety of celebrities-John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and Gram Parsons among them-stumbled through the villa’s neverending party, as did the local drug dealers, known to one and all as “les cowboys.” Villa Nellcote became the crucible in which creative strife, outsize egos, and all the usual byproducts of the Stones’ legendary hedonistic excess fused into something potent, volatile, and enduring.Here, for the first time, is the season in hell that produced <i>Exile on Main St.</i>",3.42,258,Hardcover, ,84,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68409.Exile_on_Main_Street,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68409.Exile_on_Main_Street

Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.<br /><br />Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.<br /><br />But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.<br /><br />A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about.
