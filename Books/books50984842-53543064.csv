A man travels to his son’s school to deal with the fallout of a violent attack and to make sure his son will not lose his college place. But what exactly has his son done? And who is to blame? A young woman trying to make it in LA, working in a clothes shop while taking acting classes, turns to a riskier way of making money but will be forced to confront the danger of the game she’s playing. And a family coming together for Christmas struggle to skate over the lingering darkness caused by the very ordinary brutality of a troubled husband and father.<br /><br />These outstanding stories examine masculinity, male power and broken relationships, while revealing – with astonishing insight and clarity – those moments of misunderstanding that can have life-changing consequences. And there is an unexpected violence, ever-present but unseen, in the depiction of the complicated interactions between men and women, and families. Subtle, sophisticated and displaying an extraordinary understanding of human behaviour, these stories are unforgettable.",3.44,288,Hardcover, ,305,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50984842-daddy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50984842-daddy

That what used to hold us in community no longer works, and that the spiritual offerings of yesteryear no longer help us thrive.”–Casper ter Kuile</p><p>What do Soul Cycle, gratitude journals, and tech breaks have in common? For ter Kuile they offer rituals that create the foundation for our modern spiritual lives. </p><p>We are in crisis today. Our modern technological society has left too many of us—no matter our ages—feeling isolated and bereft of purpose. Previous frameworks for building community and finding meaning no longer support us. Yet ter Kuile reveals a hopeful new message: we might not be religious, but that doesn’t mean we are any less spiritual.  </p><p>Instead, we are in the midst of a paradigm shift in which we seek belonging and meaning in secular practices. Today, we find connection in:</p> 
   CrossFit and SoulCycle, which offer a sense of belonging rooted in accountability and support much like church groups 
   <em>Harry Potter</em> and other beloved books that offer universal lessons  
   Gratitude journals, which have replaced traditional prayer  
   Tech breaks, which provide mindful moments of calm  
 <p>In <em>The Power of Ritual</em>, ter Kuile invites us to deepen these ordinary practices as intentional rituals that nurture connection and  wellbeing. With wisdom and endearing wit, ter Kuile’s call for ritual is ultimately a call to heal our loss of connection to ourselves, to others, and to our spiritual identities.</p><p><em>T</em><em>he Power of Ritual </em>reminds us that what we already do every day matters—and has the potential to become a powerful experience of reflection, sanctuary, and meaning.</p><br />",4.11,224,Kindle Edition, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51003188-the-power-of-ritual,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51003188-the-power-of-ritual

  <b>will train you to combat your own biases, address your weaknesses, and help you become a better and more confident decision-maker.</b>
</b><br /><br />What do you do when you're faced with a big decision? If you're like most people, you probably make a pro and con list, spend a lot of time obsessing about decisions that didn't work out, get caught in analysis paralysis, endlessly seek other people's opinions to find just that little bit of extra information that might make you sure, and finally go with your gut. <br /><br />What if there was a better way to make quality decisions so you can think clearly, feel more confident, second-guess yourself less, and ultimately be more decisive and be more productive? <br /><br />Making good decisions doesn't have to be a series of endless guesswork. Rather, it's a teachable skill that anyone can sharpen. In <i>How to Decide</i>, bestselling author Annie Duke and former professional poker player lays out a series of tools anyone can use to make better decisions. You'll learn:<br /><br />  <b>•</b>  To identify and dismantle hidden biases.<br />  <b>•</b>  To extract the highest quality feedback from those whose advice you seek.<br />  <b>•</b>  To more accurately identify the influence of luck in the outcome of your decisions.<br />  <b>•</b>  When to decide fast, when to decide slow, and when to decide in advance.<br />  <b>•</b>  To make decisions that more effectively help you to realize your goals and live your values.<br /><br />Through interactive exercises and engaging thought experiments, this workbook helps you analyze key decisions you've made in the past and troubleshoot those you're making in the future.

Our old postwar alliances are crumbling. Everywhere you look there's an omen, a joke whose punchline is the end of the world. How is a person supposed to live in the shadow of such a grim future? What does it mean to have children--nothing if not an act of hope? What might it be like to live through the worst? And what on Earth is anybody <i>doing</i> about it?<br /><br />Dublin-based writer Mark O'Connell is consumed by these questions--and, as the father of two young children himself, he finds them increasingly urgent. In <i>Notes from an Apocalypse</i>, he crosses the globe in pursuit of answers. He tours survival bunkers in South Dakota. He ventures to New Zealand, a favored retreat of billionaires banking on civilization's collapse. He engages with would-be Mars colonists, preppers, right-wing conspiracists. And he bears witness to those places, like Chernobyl, that the future has already visited--real-life portraits of the end of the world as we know it. In doing so, he comes to a resolution, while offering readers a unique window into our contemporary imagination.<br /><br />Both investigative and deeply personal, <i>Notes from an Apocalypse</i> is an affecting, humorous, and surprisingly hopeful meditation on our present moment.

She met a guy just like herself: same age, same background, same hopes and dreams; they got married and started a family. Too bad he made her miserable. Now, two decades later, she's a nearly-divorced, forty-one-year-old schoolteacher with two school-aged sons, and there is no script anymore. So when she meets Joseph, she isn't exactly looking for love--she's more in the market for a babysitter. Joseph is twenty-two, living at home with his mother, and working several jobs, including the butcher counter where he and Lucy meet. It's not a match anyone one could have predicted. He's of a different class, a different culture, and a different generation.

The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power—which groups have it and which do not.”<br /><br />In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.<br /><br />Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.",4.62,496,Hardcover, ,3380,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51152447-caste

Moe saw that there was tremendous comfort and community in open dialogue about these shared experiences and that humor had a unique power.

  <b>Un vívido relato que nos acerca a una de las figuras más complejas y relevantes de la diplomacia estadounidense.</b>
</p> <p>Richard Holbrooke fue un actor principal en un período histórico de incuestionable trascendencia, marcado por el ascenso y por la caída del poder de Estados Unidos. En un vibrante relato, George Packer saca a la luz el idealismo y el propósito humanitario del controvertido diplomático enfrentados, paradójicamente, a su terquedad y su egolatría, y ahonda en el papel clave que desempeñó en las guerras de Vietnam, Bosnia y Afganistán, cuyas consecuencias resuenan hasta nuestros días.</p> <p>La obra no solo penetra en los secretos y la personalidad de Holbrooke, sino que permite al lector abrirse camino a través de las esferas sociales y gubernamentales a las que este perteneció. Una incursión sin precedentes en la diplomacia estadounidense.</p> <p></p> <p><b>Reseñas:</b><br />«Dudé que cualquier novela, ni siquiera una coescrita por Graham Greene y F. Scott Fitzgerald, pudiera capturar a Holbrooke por completo, y ciertamente pensé que ninguna biografía lo haría. Pero ahora una lo ha conseguido. El libro de Packer retrata a Holbrooke en todo su esplendor... Una historia trepidante con sabor a tragicomedia de Shakespeare.»<br />Walter Isaacson, <i>The New York Times</i></p> <p>«Absolutamente fascinante. Una elegía tanto de Holbrooke como de la visión estadounidense del poder que este representaba. Una obra profunda, reflejada a través de una atractiva prosa.»<br />Barbara Spindel, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i></p> <p>«Si este libro rebosa tal intensidad, complejidad y profundidad narrativa es porque su autor había nacido para escribirlo. La fuerza de estas páginas reside en la figura de Holbrooke, que Packer ha definido al mismo nivel que Boswell definió la verdad humana que se escondía tras Samuel Johnson.»<br />Thomas Powers, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p> <p>«Una lectura genial, exuberante, elaborada y con el toque justo de cotilleo.»<br />Roger Boyes, <i>The Times</i></p> <p>«La prosa enérgica de Packer transporta al lector a través de los tres primeros actos de la vida diplomática de Holbrooke. Un trabajo de investigación impecable.»<br />Paddy Hirsch, <i>NPR</i></p> <p>«Cautivador.»<br />Max Boot, <i>The Washington Post</i></p> <p>«Excepcional, una de las disecciones del poder en Estados Unidos más fascinantes que he leído jamás.»<br />Steve Bloomfield,<i> The Guardian</i></p> <p>«Se devora como una novela. Cautivadora y brillante, desprende un aire irresistible de arrogancia.»<br />Jennifer Szalai, <i>The New York Times</i></p> <p>«Para los Estados Unidos, Packer es una voz de una claridad y una humanidad excepcionales. Cuando nuestros descendientes tracen el mapa de las ruinas de este imperio moderno en búsqueda de sus vestigios culturales, el tesoro que perdurará y van a poder desenterrar son testimonios como el de Packer.»<br /><i>Independent</i></p>",3.33, ,Kindle Edition, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51187399-nuestro-hombre,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51187399-nuestro-hombre

Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold his country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally--and willing to fight to the end.<br /><br />In <i>The Splendid and the Vile</i>, Erik Larson shows how Churchill taught the British people ""the art of being fearless."" It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it's also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill's prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports--some released only recently--Larson provides a new lens on London's darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents' wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela's illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the advisers in Churchill's ""Secret Circle,"" to whom he turns in the hardest moments.",4.23,464,Kindle Edition, ,4796,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51187948-the-splendid-and-the-vile,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51187948-the-splendid-and-the-vile

But there is a third way to look at this technology that will revolutionize the workplace and ultimately the world. Kevin Scott argues that AI has the potential to create abundance and opportunity for everyone and help solve some of our most vexing problems.<br /><br />As the chief technology officer at Microsoft, he is deeply involved in the development of AI applications, yet mindful of their potential impact on workers—knowledge he gained firsthand growing up in rural Virginia. Yes, the AI Revolution will radically disrupt economics and employment for everyone for generations to come. But what if leaders prioritized the programming of both future technology and public policy to work together to find solutions ahead of the coming AI epoch? Like public health, the space program, climate change and public education, we need international understanding and collaboration on the future of AI and work. For Scott, the crucial question facing all of us is this: How do we work to ensure that the continued development of AI allows us to keep the American Dream alive?<br /><br />In this thoughtful, informed guide, he offers a clear roadmap to find the answer.",3.48,304,Hardcover, ,17,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51194559-reprogramming-the-american-dream,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51194559-reprogramming-the-american-dream

  <strong>Two women. Two Flights. One last chance to disappear.</strong>
</p><p>Claire Cook has a perfect life. Married to the scion of a political dynasty, with a Manhattan townhouse and a staff of ten, her surroundings are elegant, her days flawlessly choreographed, and her future auspicious. But behind closed doors, nothing is quite as it seems. That perfect husband has a temper that burns as bright as his promising political career, and he's not above using his staff to track Claire's every move, making sure she's living up to his impossible standards. But what he doesn't know is that Claire has worked for months on a plan to vanish.</p><p> A chance meeting in an airport bar brings her together with a woman whose circumstances seem equally dire. Together they make a last-minute decision to switch tickets — Claire taking Eva's flight to Oakland, and Eva traveling to Puerto Rico as Claire. They believe the swap will give each of them the head start they need to begin again somewhere far away. But when the flight to Puerto Rico goes down, Claire realizes it's no longer a head start but a new life. Cut off, out of options, with the news of her death about to explode in the media, Claire will assume Eva's identity, and along with it, the secrets Eva fought so hard to keep hidden.</p><p> For fans of Lisa Jewell and Liv Constantine, <em>The Last Flight</em> is the story of two women — both alone, both scared — and one agonizing decision that will change the trajectory of both of their lives.</p>",4.12,320,Kindle Edition, ,521,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51197260-the-last-flight,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51197260-the-last-flight

Through a craven, cynical strategy engineered by Mitch McConnell, funded by the Kochs, and fueled by Fox News propaganda, Republicans have rigged American politics to drown out the voices of the people in favor of the powerful. Without an aggressive response that recognizes who the Republicans are and what they have done, American democracy as we know it won't survive this moment and a conservative, shrinking, mostly white minority will govern the country for decades.<br /><br /><i>Un-Trumping</i> <i>America</i> dismantles toxic Trumpism and offers a way forward. Dan Pfeiffer worked for nearly twenty years at the center of Democratic politics, from the campaign trail to Capitol Hill to Barack Obama's White House. But it was Trump's victory and Republicans' incessant aiding and abetting of Trumpism that has radicalized his thinking. Here, Pfeiffer urges Democrats to embrace bold solutions -- from fixing the courts to abolishing the electoral college to eliminating the filibuster -- in order to make America more democratic (and Democratic).<br /><br /><i>Un-Trumping America</i> is a powerful call for Democrats and progressives to get smarter, tougher, and more aggressive without becoming a paler shade of orange.",4.24,273,Hardcover, ,194,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51203727-un-trumping-america,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51203727-un-trumping-america

Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons (30,000 of them Londoners) and destroying two million homes. It was up to Churchill to hold the country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally--that she was willing to fight to the end.<br /><br />In <i>The Splendid and the Vile</i>, Erik Larson shows, in cinematic detail, how Churchill taught the British people ""the art of being fearless."" It is a story of political brinksmanship but also an intimate domestic drama, set against the backdrop of Churchill's prime-ministerial country house, Chequers, and his wartime residence, Ditchley, where Churchill and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, including recently declassified files, intelligence reports, and personal diaries only now available, Larson provides a new lens on London's darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his family: his wife, Clementine; their daughters, Sarah, Diana, and the youngest, Mary, who chafes against her parents' wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; her illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the cadre of close advisors who comprised Churchill's ""Secret Circle,"" including his dangerously observant private secretary, John Colville; newspaper baron Lord Beaverbrook; and the Rasputin-like Federick Lindemann.<br /><br /><i>The Splendid and the Vile</i> takes readers out of today's political dysfunction and back to a time of true leadership, when--in the face of unrelenting horror--Churchill's eloquence, strategic brilliance, and perseverance bound a country, and a family, together.",4.23,585,Hardcover, ,944,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51227088-the-splendid-and-the-vile,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51227088-the-splendid-and-the-vile

But in this debut memoir, Bobby is speaking to Bess once more, in a voice as passionate as it ever was in life.<br /><br />Recounting both family lore and family secrets, Bobby brings us four generations of indomitable women and the men who loved them. There's Bobby's mother, who traveled solo from Belarus to America in the 1880s to escape the pogroms, and Bess's mother, a 1970s rebel who always fought against convention. Then there's Bess, who grew up in New York and entered the rough-and-tumble world of L.A. television. Her grandma Bobby was with her all the way--she was the light of Bess's childhood and her fiercest supporter, giving Bess unequivocal love, even if sometimes of the toughest kind.<br /><br />In <i>Nobody Will Tell You This But Me, </i> Bobby reminds Bess of the experiences they shared, and she delivers--in phone calls, texts, and unforgettable heart-to-hearts brought vividly to the page--her signature wisdom:<br /><br /><i>If the earth is cracking behind you, you put one foot in front of the other. </i><br /><i>Never.

Back home, Mitsuko and Benson are stuck living together as unconventional roommates, an absurd domestic situation that ends up meaning more to each of them than they ever could have predicted. Without Mike's immediate pull, Benson begins to push outwards, realizing he might just know what he wants out of life and have the goods to get it.<br /><br />Both men will change in ways that will either make them stronger together, or fracture everything they've ever known. And just maybe they'll all be okay in the end. Memorial is a funny and profound story about family in all its strange forms, joyful and hard-won vulnerability, becoming who you're supposed to be, and the limits of love.",3.68,320,Kindle Edition, ,45,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51295290-memorial,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51295290-memorial

De hecho, la mayor parte de las organizaciones equiparan el potencial de liderazgo con determinados rasgos de personalidad destructivos, como narcisismo y exceso de confianza.

  <b>Por el autor del <em>best seller</em> mundial <em>El sutil arte de que (casi todo) te importe una mi*rda</em>, esta guía provee consejos inesperados para lidiar y no vivir de la esperanza.</b>
</p><p>Vivimos en un momento muy interesante. En el aspecto material, este es el mejor momento que hemos vivido como sociedad, somos más libres que nunca, más sanos y más ricos que cualquier otra época en la historia de la humanidad. Sin embargo, de alguna manera, todo parece estar irreparablemente destruido: el calentamiento global, los gobiernos se equivocan constantemente, las economías colapsan y todo mundo se siente perpetuamente ofendido en Twitter. En este momento de la historia, en el que tenemos acceso a la tecnología, a la educación y a las comunicaciones, a la que nuestros antepasados ni siquiera podían soñar, muchos de nosotros nos sentimos desesperanzados.</p><p>¿Qué está sucediendo? Si alguien puede ponerle un nombre a nuestro malestar y ayudar a solucionarlo, ese es Mark Manson.</p><p>Manson publicó <em>El sutil arte de que (casi todo) te importe una mi*rda</em>, un libro en el que explicaba las razones que nos provocan ansiedad constante en esta vida moderna. Nos mostró que la tecnología nos había ayudado a preocuparnos por las cosas equivocadas, que nuestra cultura nos había convencido de que el mundo nos debía algo cuando no era así, y lo peor de todo, la obsesión moderna y enloquecedora de encontrar siempre la felicidad. Cosas que realmente solo sirven para hacernos más infelices. En cambio, el ""sutil arte"" de ese título resultó ser un desafío audaz: el de elegir tu lucha; para reducir y enfocar el dolor que deseas soportar. El resultado fue un libro que se convirtió en un fenómeno internacional, con más de seis millones de ejemplares vendidos en todo el mundo y número 1 de las listas de los más vendidos en más de trece países.</p><p>Ahora, en <em>Todo está j*dido</em>, Manson se adentra en los fallos que tenemos como seres humanos hasta las interminables calamidades que están sucediendo alrededor del mundo entero. Partiendo desde una investigación psicológica sobre estos temas, así como de la sabiduría eterna de filósofos como Platón, Nietzsche y Tom Waits, Manosn analiza la religión y la política y las diferentes formas en las que se han manifestado. Observa nuestras relaciones con el dinero, el entretenimiento e Internet, y como nos obsesionamos hasta consumirnos psicológicamente vivos. Desafía abiertamente nuestras definiciones de fe, felicidad y libertad e incluso de la esperanza.</p><p>Con su mezcla habitual de erudición y de un humor inesperado, Manson nos coge del cuello y nos desafía a ser más honestos con nosotros mismos para conectarnos con el mundo de maneras que probablemente no hayamos considerado antes.</p><p>Es otro juego intuitivo que busca entender el dolor en nuestros corazones y el estrés de nuestra alma. Uno de los grandes escritores modernos ha producido otro libro que servirá de pauta para los años venideros.</p><p><b>Sobre <em>El sutil arte de que (casi todo) te importe una mi*rda</em>:</b><br />«La capacidad de Mark para profundizar y ofrecer una visión contra-intuitiva sobre los retos de la vida hacen que sea uno de mis escritores preferidos». <b>Matt Kepnes</b><br />«Lo contrario al resto de los libros. No lo intentes. Ríndete. Equivócate. Baja tus expectativas.

By the time British troops had put down the rebels, more than a thousand Jamaicans lay dead from summary executions and extrajudicial murder.<br /><br />While the rebels lost their military gamble, their sacrifice accelerated the larger struggle for freedom in the British Atlantic. The daring and suffering of the Jamaicans galvanized public opinion throughout the empire, resulting in a decisive turn against slavery. For centuries bondage had fed Britain's appetite for sugar. Within two years of the Christmas rebellion, slavery was formally abolished.<br /><br /><i>Island on Fire</i> is a dramatic day-by-day account of this transformative uprising. A skillful storyteller, Tom Zoellner goes back to the primary sources to tell the intimate story of the men and women who tasted liberty for a few brief weeks. He memorably evokes the sights and sounds of the Caribbean in the 1830s, provides the first full portrait of its enigmatic leader Samuel Sharpe, and gives us a poignant glimpse of the dreams of the many Jamaicans who died for liberty.",4.43,376,Hardcover, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51579763-island-on-fire,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51579763-island-on-fire

The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist, Adrian Tomine's funniest and most revealing foray into autobiography, offers an array of unexpected answers. When a sudden medical incident lands Tomine in the emergency room, he begins to question if it was really all worthwhile: despite the accolades, awards, and opportunities of a seemingly charmed career, it's the gaffes, humiliations, slights, and insults he's experienced (or caused) within the industry that loom largest in his memory.<br /><br />But as those memories are delineated in excruciatingly hilarious detail, a different, parallel narrative plays out in the background. In between chaotic book tours, disastrous interviews, and difficult interactions with other artists, life happens: Tomine fumbles his way into marriage, parenthood, and an indisputably fulfilling existence. While mining his conflicted relationship with comics and comics culture, Tomine illustrates the amusing absurdities of life and how we choose to spend our time. Through these cringe-inducing moments, a deeper emotional story emerges, and we see Tomine’s life develop into something much more robust than the blunders. <br /><br />In a bold departure in style from his award-winning Killing and Dying, Tomine distills his art to the loose, lively essentials of cartooning. His stripped-down lines communicate effortlessly, with each pen stroke economically imbued with human depth.

From their music-filled terraces, American expatriates gaze along the coastline at the lights of Monte Carlo, where fortunes are won, lost, stolen, and sometimes hidden away. When Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes arrive, they find their partnership pulled between youthful pleasures and old sins, hot sun and cool jazz, new affections and enduring loyalties.<br /><br />Russell falls into easy friendship with an enthralling American couple, Sara and Gerald Murphy, whose golden life on the Riviera has begun to attract famous writers and artists—and some of the scoundrels linked with Monte Carlo’s underworld. The Murphy set will go on to inspire everyone from F.

He has the best friends and family in the world and simply no time to dwell on what could’ve been.<br /><br />Except when it comes to Priscilla, the childhood friend he’s loved for what seems like forever.<br /><br />New York City police detective Priscilla Gutierrez has never been afraid to go after what she wants. Second guessing herself isn’t a thing she does. But lately, the once-clear vision she had for herself—her career, her relationships, her <em>life</em>—is no longer what she wants. <br /><br />What she <em>especially</em> doesn’t want is to be stuck on a private jet to the Dominican Republic with JuanPa, the one person who knows her better than anyone else.<br /><br />By the end of a single week in paradise, the love/hate thing JuanPa and Pris have been doing for sixteen years has risen to epic proportions. No one can argue their connection is still there. And they can both finally admit—if only to themselves—they’ve always been a perfect match. The future they dreamed of together is still within reach...if they can just accept each other as they are.<br /><br />This book is approximately 90,000 words<br /><br /><em>One-click with confidence.

Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), <i>City of Girls</i> explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.<br /><br />In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.<br /><br />Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. ""At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,"" she muses. ""After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.""

Hidden deep in the woods of rural Pennsylvania, this crucible of reformist liberal arts study with its experimental curriculum, wildly selective admissions policy, and formidable endowment, has produced some of the world’s best minds: prize-winning authors, artists, inventors, Supreme Court justices, presidents. For those lucky few selected, tuition, room, and board are free. But acceptance comes with a price. Students are required to give the House three years—summers included—completely removed from the outside world. Family, friends, television, music, even their clothing must be left behind. In return, the school promises its graduates a future of sublime power and prestige, and that they can become anything or anyone they desire.<br /><br />Among this year’s incoming class is Ines, who expects to trade blurry nights of parties, pills, cruel friends, and dangerous men for rigorous intellectual discipline—only to discover an environment of sanctioned revelry. The school’s enigmatic director, Viktória, encourages the students to explore, to expand their minds, to find themselves and their place within the formidable black iron gates of Catherine. <br /><br />For Ines, Catherine is the closest thing to a home she’s ever had, and her serious, timid roommate, Baby, soon becomes an unlikely friend. Yet the House’s strange protocols make this refuge, with its worn velvet and weathered leather, feel increasingly like a gilded prison. And when Baby’s obsessive desire for acceptance ends in tragedy, Ines begins to suspect that the school—in all its shabby splendor, hallowed history, advanced theories, and controlled decadence—might be hiding a dangerous agenda that is connected to a secretive, tightly knit group of students selected to study its most promising and mysterious curriculum.",3.11,320,Hardcover, ,2284,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51934838-catherine-house,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51934838-catherine-house

The shrill voice, the diminutive build, the almost ostentatious humanity – all struck a discordant note in the stiff, conventional world of the officers’ mess.

ZJ's mom explains it's because of all the head injuries his dad sustained during his career. ZJ can understand that--but it doesn't make the sting any less real when his own father forgets his name. As ZJ contemplates his new reality, he has to figure out how to hold on tight to family traditions and recollections of the glory days, all the while wondering what their past amounts to if his father can't remember it. And most importantly, can those happy feelings ever be reclaimed when they are all so busy aching for the past?",4.36,176,Hardcover, ,658,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51988656-before-the-ever-after,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51988656-before-the-ever-after

  <b>**Crouchback is a medieval word derived from crossed-back and indicates participation in a Crusade**</b>
</div><br /> April 1284. As a newly widowed lady-in-waiting to the very pregnant Queen Eleanor of England, Catrin never expected to return to Wales again. She was definitely unprepared to be confronted with murder when she got there--or to find herself face-to-face with Rhys, the childhood friend she lost twenty years before. Rhys had never intended to return home either, but a lifetime of war has deposited him right back where he started--impoverished and owing service to Catrin's older brother.<br /><br />With Wales having fallen irrevocably to England, and fearful of trusting anyone within the English court of King Edward, Catrin and Rhys join forces against the treachery and intrigue rife within the half-built Caernarfon Castle. And when the murderer strikes again, the task before them becomes increasingly clear: catch the killer, certainly, but also protect their people from a future that is becoming more dangerous and uncertain with every day that passes.<div>

Soon, Lucy is spinning a web of deceit that involves her family, her fiancé, the co-op board of her Fifth Avenue apartment, and ultimately herself as she tries mightily to deny George entry into her world–and her heart.

In Contesting the Iranian Revolution, however, Pouya Alimagham re-examines this evaluation, deconstructing the conventional win-lose binary interpretations in a way which underscores the subtle but important victories on the ground, and reveals how Iran's modern history imbues those triumphs with consequential meaning. Focusing on the men and women who made this dynamic history, and who exist at the centre of these contentious politics, this 'history from below' brings to the fore the post-Islamist discursive assault on the government's symbols of legitimation. From powerful symbols rooted in Shiʿite Islam, Palestinian liberation, and the Iranian Revolution, Alimagham harnesses the wider history of Iran and the Middle East to highlight how activists contested the Islamic Republic's legitimacy to its very core.",4.40,364,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52068225-contesting-the-iranian-revolution,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52068225-contesting-the-iranian-revolution

She can’t stand it when he gallantly offers to trade hotel rooms with her so that she can have the view of the Tyrrhenian Sea, she can’t stand that he knows more about Curzio Malaparte than she does, and she really can’t stand it when he kisses her in the darkness of the ancient ruins of a Roman villa and they are caught by her snobbish, disapproving cousin, Charlotte. “Your mother is Chinese so it’s no surprise you’d be attracted to someone like him,” Charlotte teases. Daughter of an American-born-Chinese mother and blue-blooded New York father, Lucie has always sublimated the Asian side of herself in favor of the white side, and she adamantly denies having feelings for George. But several years later, when George unexpectedly appears in East Hampton where Lucie is weekending with her new fiancé, Lucie finds herself drawn to George again. Soon, Lucy is spinning a web of deceit that involves her family, her fiancé, the co-op board of her Fifth Avenue apartment, and ultimately herself as she tries mightily to deny George entry into her world–and her heart.

Most Americans could agree that no candidate like Donald Trump had ever been elected President before. But political journalist Ezra Klein makes the case that the 2016 election wasn't surprising at all. In fact, Trump's electoral victory followed the exact same template as previous elections, by capturing a nearly identical percentage of voter demographics as previous Republican candidates.<br /><br />Over the past 50 years in America, our partisan identities have merged with our racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities. Those merged identities have attained a weight that is breaking much in our politics and tearing at the bonds that hold this country together.<br /><br />In this groundbreaking book, Klein shows how and why American politics polarized around identity in the 20th century, and what that polarization did to the way we see the world and each other. And he traces the feedback loops between our polarized political identities and our polarized political institutions that are driving our political system towards crisis.<br /><br />Neither a polemic nor a lament, Klein offers a clear framework for understanding everything from Trump's rise to the Democratic Party's leftward shift to the politicization of everyday culture.

</p><p>Another spring, another dead girl pulled from a lake in the Appalachian foothills: the latest victim in a series of murders with few leads. But Detective Geena Brassard and her partner, Parker Reed, finally land a break when they receive a tip about a previously unknown survivor of the so-called Spring Strangler.</p><p>The survivor’s reluctant to help with the case for reasons that aren’t all clear. Even so, Geena uncovers a connective thread between the victims, and recently discovered DNA brings her closer to the killer’s identity. But Geena knows the survivor has the most to offer the investigation—if also the most to lose.</p><p>Geena is torn between securing the surviving victim’s help and protecting her from further danger. One thing is certain: Geena and Parker must find answers before the killer claims another life—or returns to finish off the one who got away.</p>",4.21, ,Kindle Edition, ,55,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52166486-spring-girls,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52166486-spring-girls

More memories materialize and yet she still can’t recall anything about the previous two days. Diagnosed as having experienced a dissociative state, she starts to wonder if it may have been triggered by something she saw—an accident, or worse—or if a trauma from her childhood has risen to the surface. </p> <p>Desperate for answers, Ally tries to track where she spent the missing days, but every detail she unearths points to an explanation that’s increasingly ominous, and it’s clear someone wants to prevent her from learning where those forty-eight hours went.

  <i>The Times</i>
</b><br /><br />In August 1765 the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and forced him to establish in his richest provinces a new administration run by English merchants who collected taxes through means of a ruthless private army – what we would now call an act of involuntary privatisation.<br /><br />The East India Company's founding charter authorised it to 'wage war' and it had always used violence to gain its ends. But the creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional international trading corporation dealing in silks and spices and became something much more unusual: an aggressive colonial power in the guise of a multinational business. In less than four decades it had trained up a security force of around 200,000 men – twice the size of the British army – and had subdued an entire subcontinent, conquering first Bengal and finally, in 1803, the Mughal capital of Delhi itself. The Company's reach stretched until almost all of India south of the Himalayas was effectively ruled from a boardroom in London.<br /><br /><i>The Anarchy</i> tells the remarkable story of how one of the world's most magnificent empires disintegrated and came to be replaced by a dangerously unregulated private company, based thousands of miles overseas in one small office, five windows wide, and answerable only to its distant shareholders. In his most ambitious and riveting book to date, William Dalrymple tells the story of the East India Company as it has never been told before, unfolding a timely cautionary tale of the first global corporate power.<br /><b></b>",4.15,576,Kindle Edition, ,59,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52371836-the-anarchy,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52371836-the-anarchy

It asks a number of questions relating to the nature of destiny and the human condition. The characters in the book, ranging from doctors to vacationers to fugitives, all help to show the effects the plague has on a populace. <br />The novel is believed to be based on the cholera epidemic that killed a large percentage of Oran's population in 1849 following French colonization, but the novel is placed in the 1940s.[1] Oran and its environs were struck by disease multiple times before Camus published this novel. According to a research report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Oran was decimated by the plague in 1556 and 1678, but all later outbreaks, in 1921 (185 cases), 1931 (76 cases), and 1944 (95 cases), were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel. <br /> <br />The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label.[2][3] The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings, the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition. <br /> <br />Camus included a dim-witted character misreading The Trial as a mystery novel as an oblique homage. The novel has been read as an allegorical treatment of the French resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II.[4] Additionally, he further illustrates the human reaction towards the ""absurd"".[5] The Plague represents how the world deals with the philosophical notion of the Absurd, a theory that Camus himself helped to define.",4.01, ,Kindle Edition, ,13,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52376041-the-plague,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52376041-the-plague

What’s with his curt responses, impulsiveness, newfound obsession with gaming, and . . . that funky smell? As pediatrician and mother of two teenagers Cara Natterson explains, puberty starts in boys long before any visible signs appear, which causes confusion about their changing temperaments for boys and their parents alike. Often, they also grow quieter as they grow taller, which leads to less parent-child communication. But, as Natterson warns in Decoding Boys, we respect their increasing “need” for privacy, monosyllabic conversations, and alone time at their peril. Explaining how modern culture mixes badly with male adolescent biology, Natterson offers science, strategies, scripts, and tips for getting it right:<br /> <br />• Recognizing the first signs of puberty and talking to our sons about the wide range of “normal” through the whole developmental process <br />• Why teenagers make irrational decisions even though they look mature—and how to steer them toward better choices<br />• Managing video game and screen time, including discussing the unrealistic and dangerous nature of pornography <br />• Why boys need emotional and physical contact with parents—and how to give it in ways they’ll accept<br />• How to prepare boys to resist both old and new social pressures—drugs, alcohol, vaping, and sexting <br />• Teaching consent and sensitivity in the #metoo culture <br /> <br />Decoding Boys is a powerful and validating lifeline, a book that will help today’s parents keep their sons safe, healthy, and resilient, as well as ensure they become emotionally secure young men.",3.86,288,Hardcover, ,65,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52389660-decoding-boys,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52389660-decoding-boys

To top it off, while most people could access and manipulate at least one or two of the basic elemental energies, she could see them all – but was unable to manipulate a single one. <br /> <br />Despite these setbacks, Sandra spent the majority of her twenty-six years of life visually learning the processes, techniques, and secret formulas for every aspect of crafting she could discover. And it was that pursuit of knowledge that ultimately led to her untimely death. <br /> <br />Reborn in the shape of a tiny Dungeon Core, Sandra learned about the purpose behind dungeons and Cores from an assigned dungeon helper; at the same time, she also discovered that she had much more freedom than most other Dungeon Cores. The repercussions of her mere existence could end up being far-reaching, but the most important thing she learned had nothing to do with the other Cores, the different races, or even the real purpose behind her being brought back to life as a strange glowing gem. <br /> <br />Sandra didn’t care about any of that, though – all she cared about was that she could finally do some crafting. <br /> <br />This Dungeon Core story contains LitRPG/GameLit elements such as statistics and leveling and a heavy crafting emphasis.

Since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne in 2015, Mohammed bin Salman has leveraged his influence to restructure the kingdom’s economy, loosen its strict Islamic social codes, and confront its enemies around the region, especially Iran. That vision won him fans at home and on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, in Hollywood, and at the White House, where President Trump embraced the prince as a key player in his own vision for the Middle East. But over time, the sheen of the visionary young reformer has become tarnished, leaving many struggling to determine whether MBS is in fact a rising dictator whose inexperience and rash decisions are destabilizing the world’s most volatile region.<br /> <br />Based on years of reporting and hundreds of interviews, MBS reveals the machinations behind the kingdom’s catastrophic military intervention in Yemen, the bizarre detention of princes and businessmen in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton, and the shifting Saudi relationships with Israel and the United States. And finally, it sheds new light on the greatest scandal of the young autocrat’s rise: the brutal killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, a crime that shook Saudi Arabia’s relationship with Washington and left the world wondering whether MBS could get away with murder.<br /> <br />MBS is a riveting, eye-opening account of how the young prince has wielded vast powers to reshape his kingdom and the world around him.",4.16,384,Hardcover, ,144,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52505707-mbs,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52505707-mbs

This from a sedentary man in his sixties who’s never done a lick of exercise in his life. His wife can’t help but observe that his ambition is “hopelessly trite.” A loner, Serenata disdains mass group activities of any sort. Besides, his timing is cruel.

Ursula Burton was friendly but reserved, and spoke English with a slight foreign accent. By all accounts, she seemed to be living a simple, unassuming life. Her neighbors in the village knew little about her.<br /><br />They didn’t know that she was a high-ranking Soviet intelligence officer.

There's a lot to answer for: the United States has subjugated African-Americans and other ethnic minorities since its founding—from slavery to Jim Crow to modern police brutality.

He has his own reason for returning to his childhood home, but it is not to revisit the past, unlike his Uncle Koji. Koji lives with the memories of Daniel’s mother, Mariko, the love of his life, and the scars of a life hard-lived. He can’t wait to see Daniel, who he’s always thought of as a son, but he knows the time has come to tell him the truth about his mother, and his father. But Daniel’s arrival coincides with the awakening of the Mauna Loa volcano, and its dangerous path toward their village stirs both new and long ago passions in their community.<br /><br />Alternating between past and present—from the day of the volcano eruption in 1935 to decades prior—<em>The Color of Air</em> interweaves the stories of Daniel, Koji, and Mariko to create a rich, vibrant, bittersweet chorus that celebrates their lifelong bond to one other and to their immigrant community. As Mauna Loa threatens their lives and livelihoods, it also unearths long held secrets simmering below the surface that meld past and present, revealing a path forward for them all.<br /><br /><br />",3.78,304,Hardcover, ,225,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52585218-the-color-of-air,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52585218-the-color-of-air

She just knew she felt her best when she was empty, ""like a straw"", as she says ""something you could blow through.""<br /><br />For almost thirty years, Susan Burton has hidden her obsession with food and the secret life of compulsive eating and starving that dominated her adolescence. This is the relentlessly honest, fiercely intelligent story of living with both anorexia and binge-eating disorder, moving past her shame, and learning to tell her secret.<br /><br />When Burton was thirteen, her stable life in suburban Michigan was turned upside down by her parents' abrupt divorce, and she moved to Colorado with her mother and sister. She seized on this move west as an adventure and an opportunity to reinvent herself from middle-school nerd to popular teenage girl. But she hadn't escaped unscathed, and in the fallout from her parents' breakup, an inherited fixation on thinness went from ""peculiarity to pathology."" She entered into a painful cycle of anorexia and binge eating that formed a subterranean layer to her sunny life. She went from success to success--she went to Yale, scored a dream job at a magazine right out of college, and married her college boyfriend. But in college the compulsive eating got worse--she'd binge, swear it would be the last time, and then, hours later, do it again--and after she graduated she descended into anorexia, her attempt to ""quit food.""<br /><br />Binge eating is more prevalent than anorexia or bulimia, but there is less research and little storytelling to help us understand it.

  <i>“I am Ana. I was the wife of Jesus.”</i>
</b><br /><br />Raised in a wealthy family in Sepphoris with ties to the ruler of Galilee, Ana is rebellious and ambitious, a relentless seeker with a brilliant, curious mind and a daring spirit. She yearns for a pursuit worthy of her life, but finds no outlet for her considerable talents. Defying the expectations placed on women, she engages in furtive scholarly pursuits and writes secret narratives about neglected and silenced women. When she meets the eighteen-year-old Jesus, each is drawn to and enriched by the other’s spiritual and philosophical ideas. He becomes a floodgate for her intellect, but also the awakener of her heart.<br /><br />Their marriage unfolds with love and conflict, humor and pathos in Nazareth, where Ana makes a home with Jesus, his brothers, James and Simon, and their mother, Mary. Here, Ana’s pent-up longings intensify amid the turbulent resistance to the Roman occupation of Israel, partially led by her charismatic adopted brother, Judas. She is sustained by her indomitable aunt Yaltha, who is searching for her long-lost daughter, as well as by other women, including her friend Tabitha, who is sold into slavery after she was raped, and Phasaelis, the shrewd wife of Herod Antipas. Ana’s impetuous streak occasionally invites danger. When one such foray forces her to flee Nazareth for her safety shortly before Jesus’s public ministry begins, she makes her way with Yaltha to Alexandria, where she eventually finds refuge and purpose in unexpected surroundings.<br /><br />Grounded in meticulous historical research and written with a reverential approach to Jesus’s life that focuses on his humanity, <i>The Book of Longings</i> is an inspiring account of one woman’s bold struggle to realize the passion and potential inside her, while living in a time, place, and culture devised to silence her.",4.25,416,Hardcover, ,5329,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52698452-the-book-of-longings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52698452-the-book-of-longings

Thatcher's policies have put husbands and sons out of work, and the city's notorious drugs epidemic is waiting in the wings. Shuggie's mother Agnes walks a wayward path: she is Shuggie's guiding light but a burden for him and his siblings. She dreams of a house with its own front door while she flicks through the pages of the Freemans catalogue, ordering a little happiness on credit, anything to brighten up her grey life. Married to a philandering taxi-driver husband, Agnes keeps her pride by looking good--her beehive, make-up, and pearly-white false teeth offer a glamourous image of a Glaswegian Elizabeth Taylor. But under the surface, Agnes finds increasing solace in drink, and she drains away the lion's share of each week's benefits--all the family has to live on--on cans of extra-strong lager hidden in handbags and poured into tea mugs. Agnes's older children find their own ways to get a safe distance from their mother, abandoning Shuggie to care for her as she swings between alcoholic binges and sobriety. Shuggie is meanwhile struggling to somehow become the normal boy he desperately longs to be, but everyone has realized that he is ""no right,"" a boy with a secret that all but him can see. Agnes is supportive of her son, but her addiction has the power to eclipse everyone close to her--even her beloved Shuggie.<br /><br />A heartbreaking story of addiction, sexuality, and love, <i>Shuggie Bain</i> is an epic portrayal of a working-class family that is rarely seen in fiction.

The days are long, her kids are ungrateful, her husband is distant, and her to-do list is never really done. The one thing she has to look forward to is her book club, a group of Charleston mothers united only by their love for true-crime and suspenseful fiction. In these meetings, they're more likely to discuss the FBI's recent siege of Waco as much as the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood.<br /><br />But when an artistic and sensitive stranger moves into the neighborhood, the book club's meetings turn into speculation about the newcomer. Patricia is initially attracted to him, but when some local children go missing, she starts to suspect the newcomer is involved. She begins her own investigation, assuming that he's a Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy. What she uncovers is far more terrifying, and soon she—and her book club—are the only people standing between the monster they've invited into their homes and their unsuspecting community.",3.86,14,Audiobook,unabridged,144,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52744300-the-southern-book-club-s-guide-to-slaying-vampires,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52744300-the-southern-book-club-s-guide-to-slaying-vampires

Tracing the full arc of a harrowing relationship with a charismatic but volatile woman, Machado struggles to make sense of how what happened to her shaped the person she was becoming.</p><p>And it’s that struggle that gives the book its original structure: each chapter is driven by its own narrative trope—the haunted house, erotica, the bildungsroman—through which Machado holds the events up to the light and examines them from different angles. She looks back at her religious adolescence, unpacks the stereotype of lesbian relationships as safe and utopian, and widens the view with essayistic explorations of the history and reality of abuse in queer relationships.</p><p>Machado’s dire narrative is leavened with her characteristic wit, playfulness, and openness to inquiry. She casts a critical eye over legal proceedings, fairy tales, <i>Star Trek</i>, and Disney villains, as well as iconic works of film and fiction. The result is a wrenching, riveting book that explodes our ideas about what a memoir can do and be.</p>",4.52,247,Kindle Edition, ,199,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52759167-in-the-dream-house,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52759167-in-the-dream-house

Es una novela de amor y es una novela que al final termina por brindar esperanza.</p> <p>«Una novela polifónica que narra con intensidad y con excepcional dinamismo una historia de violencia en el México contemporáneo donde el amor y la redención aún son posibles. El autor se sirve tantode una extraordinaria fuerza visual como de la recreación y reinvención del lenguaje coloquial para lograr una obra de inquietante verosimilitud.

Within three years, she had recorded three best-selling albums and had embarked on a tour of southern US campuses, playing to integrated audiences in an era of segregation. When Time magazine chronicled the folk revival in November 1962, her portrait was on the cover. Her voice was “as lustrous and rich as old gold.” She has mentored generations of singer-songwriters, most famously Bob Dylan. But Joan Baez has always been much more than simply a singer. Even before she stepped on to the podium beside Dr Martin Luther King at the March on Washington, her voice was raised in sorrow and anger as well as in song. The causes for which she has campaigned are legion and it’s no surprise that she was chosen to open Live Aid in Philadelphia in 1985. In 1993, amid the siege of Bosnia, she donned a flak jacket to sing for the citizens of Sarajevo offering, as so many times before and since, “an act of love, sharing, witness and music”. Now approaching 80, Baez has stepped down from the stage following a worldwide farewell tour and a final Grammy-nominated album. The Last Leaf is a celebration of a timeless figure whose music and influence will endure long after her voice is silenced. The Discography is by Grammy-nominated music historian Arthur Levy. Joan Baez is the recipient of the 2020 Woody Guthrie Prize.",4.17,224,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52772063-joan-baez,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52772063-joan-baez

Unfortunately, no man is strong enough to tame the stubborn beauty's fierce will. Except, perhaps, the powerful and arrogant Earl of Westcliff—a man Lillian despises more than anyone she's ever met.<br /><br />Marcus, Lord Westcliff, is famous for his icy English reserve and his supreme self-control. But something about the audacious Lillian drives him mad. Whenever they're in the same room, they can't stop themselves from battling furiously to gain the upper hand.<br /><br />Then one afternoon, a stunningly sensuous encounter changes everything... and Lillian discovers that beneath the earl's reserved façade, he is the passionate and tender lover of her dreams. What neither Westcliff nor Lillian suspect, however, is that a sinister conspiracy threatens to destroy any chance of happiness.

  </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>A biography for younger readers about one of the most influential activists of our time, who was an early advocate for African Americans and for gay rights.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>""Bayard had an unshakable optimism, nerves of steel, and, most importantly, a faith that if the cause is just and people are organized, nothing can stand in our way.""—President Barack Obama</strong>
</p><p>""Bayard Rustin was one of the great organizers and activists of the Civil Rights Movement. Without his skill and vision, the historic impact of the March on Washington might not have been possible. I am glad this biography will make young people aware of his life and his incredible contribution to American history.<strong>—Congressman John Lewis</strong></p><p>""'We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers,' declared Bayard Rustin in the late 1940s. A proponent of nonviolent resistance and a stalwart figure in the civil rights movement, Rustin organized a profound and peaceful milestone in American history—the 1963 March on Washington. . . .  <em>Troublemaker for Justice</em> describes not only how Rustin orchestrated the March on Washington in two months but also how he stood up for his Quaker principles throughout his life. The three authors, Jacqueline Houtman, Walter Naegle and Michael G. Long, show the difficulties Rustin faced as a gay black man in 20th-century America, and that he shouldered them with strength, intelligence, and a quest for peace and justice.""—<strong>Abby Nolan, <em>The Washington Post</em></strong></p><p>""An excellent biography that belongs in every young adult library. Readers will find Rustin’s story captivating; his story could encourage young people to fight for change.""—<strong>Michelle Kornberger, <i>Library Journal</i>,*Starred Review</strong></p><p>""In today's political landscape, this volume is a lesson in the courage to live according to one's truth and the dedication it takes to create a better world.""—<strong><em>Kirkus Reviews, *Starred Review</em></strong></p><p>""A long-overdue introduction to a fascinating, influential change maker.""—<strong><em>Publishers Weekly, *Starred Review</em></strong></p><p>""This biography is an indispensable addition to the literature of both civil and gay rights.""—<strong>Michael Cart, <em>Booklist</em>, *Starred review</strong></p><p>Bayard Rustin was a major figure in the Civil Rights movement. He was arrested on a bus 13 years before Rosa Parks and he participated in integrated bus rides throughout the South 14 years before the Freedom Riders. He was a mentor to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., teaching him the techniques and philosophy of Gandhian nonviolent direct action. He organized the March on Washington in 1963, one of the most impactful mobilizations in American history.</p><p>Despite these contributions, few Americans recognize his name, and he is absent from most history books, in large part because he was gay. This biography traces Rustin’s life, from his childhood and his first arrest in high school for sitting in the “whites only” section of a theater, through a lifetime of nonviolent activism.</p><p>""Authors Jacqueline Houtman, Walter Naegle, and Michael G. Long provide middle and high school students with a biography of Rustin that illustrates how the personal is political. Young readers will take away valuable lessons about identity, civics, and 20th-century history.</p>",4.03,177,Kindle Edition, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52847643-troublemaker-for-justice,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52847643-troublemaker-for-justice

When she returns to her hometown of New York City to film the starring role in a bilingual romantic comedy for the number one streaming service in the country, Jasmine figures her new “Leading Lady Plan” should be easy enough to follow—until a casting shake-up pairs her with telenovela hunk Ashton Suárez. <br /><br /><em>Leading Ladies don</em><em>’t need a man to be happy</em>. <br /><br />After his last telenovela character was killed off, Ashton is worried his career is dead as well. Joining this new cast as a last-minute addition will give him the chance to show off his acting chops to American audiences and ping the radar of Hollywood casting agents. To make it work, he’ll need to generate smoking-hot on-screen chemistry with Jasmine.

People themselves continue to disappear seemingly without a trace even with all of the technological and scientific advancement that humanity has had. <br /> <br />People disappear every single day, but there are a few cases that simply defy explanation. There are those who have walked into forests and never come out. There are people who have disappeared from secure compounds with no explanation, and even individuals who seem to have vanished into thin air right in front of security cameras. As much as we would like to find some mundane explanation for these cases, a persistent percentage of disappearances remain completely mysterious in every sense of the word.

However, unbeknownst to his many loved ones, Martinez worked as a drug cartel debt collector and hitman for over 35 years, terrorizing the poor, rural, immigrant communities of California's Central Valley and beyond. Having confessed to three dozen murders, he is one of the most prolific serial killers in American history--along the lines of Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, and even H.H. Holmes. And yet until he voluntarily turned himself in, Martinez was virtually unstoppable. How did Martinez manage to evade law enforcement for so long with little more than a slap on the wrist? Because he understood a dark truth about the criminal justice system: if you kill the right people--people who are poor, who aren't white, and who don't have anyone to speak up for them--you can get away with it. Melding the pacing and suspense of a true crime thriller with the rigor of top-notch investigative journalism, <b>

Feeling lonesome and homesick for the Midwest, she wonders if she’ll ever make it as a reporter in the big city—and whether she made a terrible mistake in breaking up with her longtime boyfriend, Matthew. <br /><br />As Cecily reaches for the phone to call him, she hears a guy on the barstool next to her say, “Don’t do it—you’ll regret it.” Something tells her to listen, and over the next several hours—and shots of tequila—the two forge an unlikely connection. That should be it, they both decide the next morning, as Cecily reminds herself of the perils of a rebound relationship.

Sin embargo, no es ni siquiera la punta del gigantesco iceberg de horrores inimaginables que amenazan la vida en la Tierra: incendios, huracanes, sequías, inundaciones... Todas estas inquietantes manifestaciones del cambio climático, ya recurrentes para millones de personas, son solo un adelanto de lo que está por llegar: hambrunas, plagas, un aire irrespirable, migraciones cada vez más masivas, el colapso económico e incluso conflictos armados globales.</p> <p>Con una precisión y una lucidez que estremecen, David Wallace-Wells construye el relato caleidoscópico de las consecuencias que tendrá, tan solo dentro de una generación, nuestra impasibilidad ante la crisis ecológica. Incidiendo con crudeza en cómo hemos fracasado al imaginar y, ante todo, promulgar un mejor porvenir, <i>El planeta inhóspito </i>nos transporta a un futuro inminente y nos sirve la reflexión definitiva de cómo hemos devastado nuestro propio hogar; todo ello en clave de una ferviente y aún más apremiante llamada al cambio.</p> <p><b>Reseñas:</b><br />«Un libro que tenemos que leer si no queremos que nuestros nietos nos maldigan.»<br />Timothy Snyder</p> <p>«Un libro penetrante, que a la vez me da miedo y esperanza sobre el futuro.»<br />Jonathan Safran Foer</p> <p>«David Wallace-Wells ha generado intencionadamente una sobrecogedora polémica, a caballo entre los estilos de Stephen King y Stephen Hawking.

And women were going into space and breaking records here on Earth.<br /><br />Ensuring the rights and opportunities of women and girls remains a big piece of the unfinished business of the twenty-first century. While there's a lot of work to do, we know that throughout history and around the globe women have overcome the toughest resistance imaginable to win victories that have made progress possible for all of us. That is the achievement of each of the women in this book.<br /><br />So how did they do it? The answers are as unique as the women themselves. Civil rights activist Dorothy Height, LGBTQ trailblazer Edie Windsor, and swimmer Diana Nyad kept pushing forward, no matter what. Writers like Rachel Carson and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie named something no one had dared talk about before. Historian Mary Beard used wit to open doors that were once closed, and Wangari Maathai, who sparked a movement to plant trees, understood the power of role modeling. Harriet Tubman and Malala Yousafzai looked fear in the face and persevered. Nearly every single one of these women was fiercely optimistic - they had faith that their actions could make a difference. And they were right.<br /><br />To us, they are all gutsy women - leaders with the courage to stand up to the status quo, ask hard questions, and get the job done. So in the moments when the long haul seems awfully long, we hope you will draw strength from these stories. We do. Because if history shows one thing, it's that the world needs gutsy women.",4.14,15,Audio CD, ,376,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53086148-the-book-of-gutsy-women,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53086148-the-book-of-gutsy-women

For months Kantor and Twohey had been having confidential discussions with top actresses, former Weinstein employees and other sources, learning of disturbing long-buried allegations, some of which had been covered up by onerous legal settlements. The journalists meticulously picked their way through a web of decades-old secret payouts and nondisclosure agreements, pressed some of the most famous women in the world--and some unknown ones--to risk going on the record, and faced down Weinstein, his team of high-priced defenders, and even his private investigators. <br /><br />But nothing could have prepared them for what followed the publication of their Weinstein story.

  <b>From National Book Critics Circle Award-winning author Ariel Sabar, the gripping true story of a sensational religious forgery and the scandal that engulfed Harvard.</b>
</b><br /><br />In 2012, Dr. Karen King, a star professor at Harvard Divinity School, announced a blockbuster discovery at a scholarly conference just steps from the Vatican: She had found an ancient fragment of papyrus in which Jesus calls Mary Magdalene ""my wife."" The tattered manuscript made international headlines. If early Christians believed Jesus was married, it would upend the 2,000-year history of the world's predominant faith, threatening not just the celibate, all-male priesthood but sacred teachings on marriage, sex and women's leadership. Biblical scholars were in an uproar, but King had impeccable credentials as a world-renowned authority on female figures in the lost Christian texts from Egypt known as the Gnostic gospels. ""The Gospel of Jesus's Wife""--as she provocatively titled her discovery--was both a crowning career achievement and powerful proof for her arguments that Christianity from its start embraced alternative, and far more inclusive, voices.<br /><br />As debates over the manuscript's authenticity raged, award-winning journalist Ariel Sabar set out to investigate a baffling mystery: where did this tiny scrap of papyrus come from? His search for answers is an international detective story--leading from the factory districts of Berlin to the former headquarters of the East German Stasi before winding up in rural Florida, where he discovered an internet pornographer with a prophetess wife, a fascination with the Pharaohs and a tortured relationship with the Catholic Church.<br /><br />VERITAS is a tale of fierce intellectual rivalries at the highest levels of academia, a piercing psychological portrait of a disillusioned college dropout whose life had reached a breaking point, and a tragedy about a brilliant scholar handed an ancient papyrus that appealed to her greatest hopes for Christianity--but forced a reckoning with fundamental questions about the nature of truth and the line between faith and reason.",4.24,416,Hardcover, ,88,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53146675-veritas,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53146675-veritas

In <em>This Is Pleasure</em>, she considers our present moment through the lens of a particular #MeToo incident.<br /> <br />The effervescent, well-dressed Quin, a successful book editor and fixture on the New York arts scene, has been accused of repeated unforgivable transgressions toward women in his orbit. But are they unforgivable? And who has the right to forgive him? To Quin’s friend Margot, the wrongdoing is less clear. Alternating Quin’s and Margot’s voices and perspectives, Gaitskill creates a nuanced tragicomedy, one that reveals her characters as whole persons—hurtful and hurting, infuriating and touching, and always deeply recognizable.<br /> <br />Gaitskill has said that fiction is the only way that she could approach this subject because it is too emotionally faceted to treat in the more rational essay form. Her compliment to her characters—and to her readers—is that they are unvarnished and real. Her belief in our ability to understand them, even when we don’t always admire them, is a gesture of humanity from one of our greatest contemporary writers.",3.57,83,Hardcover, ,74,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53152673-this-is-pleasure,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53152673-this-is-pleasure

While it's clear that women and girls are vital voices and agents of change for this planet, they are too often missing from the proverbial table.

These women offer a spectrum of ideas and insights for how we can rapidly, radically reshape society.<br /><br />Intermixing essays with poetry and art, this book is both a balm and a guide for knowing and holding what has been done to the world, while bolstering our resolve never to give up on one another or our collective future. We must summon truth, courage, and solutions to turn away from the brink and toward life-giving possibility.

From its start in 1921 as an Atlantic City tourist draw to its current incarnation as a scholarship competition, the pageant has indexed women’s status during periods of social change―the post-suffrage 1920s, the Eisenhower 1950s, the #MeToo era.

The pageant’s history includes, crucially, those it excluded; the notorious Rule Seven, which required contestants to be “of the white race,” was retired in the 1950s, but no women of color were crowned until the 1980s.<br /><br />In rigorously researched, vibrant chapters that unpack each decade of the pageant, Looking for Miss America examines the heady blend of capitalism, patriotism, class anxiety, and cultural mythology that has fueled this American ritual.",3.85,320,Hardcover,1st Edition,20,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53320092-looking-for-miss-america,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53320092-looking-for-miss-america

Trump watches over six hours of Fox News a day, a habit his staff refers to as “executive time.” In January 2020, when Fox News began to downplay COVID-19, the President was quick to agree. In March, as the deadly virus spiraled out of control, Sean Hannity mocked “coronavirus hysteria” as “new hoax” from the left. Millions of Americans took Hannity and Trump's words as truth—until some of them started to get sick.<br /><br />In Hoax, CNN anchor and chief media correspondent Brian Stelter tells the twisted story of the relationship between Donald Trump and Fox News. From the moment Trump glided down the golden escalator to announce his candidacy in the 2016 presidential election to his acquittal on two articles of impeachment in early 2020, Fox hosts spread his lies and smeared his enemies. Over the course of two years, Stelter spoke with over 250 current and former Fox insiders in an effort to understand the inner workings of Rupert Murdoch's multibillion-dollar media empire. Some of the confessions are alarming. “We don't really believe all this stuff,” a producer says. “We just tell other people to believe it.”<br /><br />At the center of the story lies Sean Hannity, a college dropout who, following the death of Fox News mastermind Roger Ailes, reigns supreme at the network that pays him $30 million a year. Stelter describes the raging tensions inside Fox between the Trump loyalists and the few remaining journalists. He reveals why former chief news anchor Shep Smith resigned in disgust in 2019; why a former anchor said “if I stay here I’ll get cancer;” and how Trump has exploited the leadership vacuum at the top to effectively seize control of the network.<br /><br />Including never before reported details, Hoax exposes the media personalities who, though morally bankrupt, profit outrageously by promoting the President’s propaganda and radicalizing the American right.

At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split</i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman</i> originally re-defined the graphic novel.<br /><br />When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more. <br /><br />A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror.

Col. Henry P. Maxwell, the British representative in the subjugated Tibeto-Burman kingdom of Manipur. A poignant story of love and fealty, treachery and valour, it is set in the midst of the imperialist intrigues of the British Raj, the glory of kings, warring princes, clever queens and loyal retainers. Reviving front-page global headlines of the day, Binodini's perspective is from the vanquished by love and war, and the humbling of a proud kingdom. Its sorrows and empathy sparkle with wit and beauty, as it deftly dissects the build-up and aftermath of the perfidy of the Anglo-Manipuri War of 1891. Binodini is the supreme stylist of contemporary Manipuri literature and an icon of Manipuri modernism, and her tale of a forbidden love and ostracism vividly brings to life the court and manners of a little-known Asian kingdom. In doing so, she recovers its little-known history, its untold relations with India and Great Britain, and a forgotten chapter of the British Raj.",3.84,256,Kindle Edition, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53411152-the-princess-and-the-political-agent,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53411152-the-princess-and-the-political-agent

As a child, she channeled otherworldly power to free herself from slavery. Now her new neighbor, a white woman named Charlotte, seeks her company, and an uneasy friendship grows between them. But Charlotte has also sought solace in the Ku Klux Klan, a relationship that jeopardizes Josephine’s family.<br /><br />Nearly one hundred years later, Josephine’s descendant, Ava, is a single mother who has just lost her job. She moves in with her white grandmother, Martha, a wealthy but lonely woman who pays Ava to be her companion. But Martha’s behavior soon becomes erratic, then threatening, and Ava must escape before her story and Josephine’s converge.<br /><br /><i>The Revisioners</i> explores the depths of women’s relationships―powerful women and marginalized women, healers and survivors.

After months in the fetid, overcrowded jail, she learns she is sentenced to “the land beyond the seas,” Van Diemen’s Land, a penal colony in Australia. Though uncertain of what awaits, Evangeline knows one thing: the child she carries will be born on the months-long voyage to this distant land.<br /><br />During the journey on a repurposed slave ship, the<em> Medea</em>, Evangeline strikes up a friendship with Hazel, a girl little older than her former pupils who was sentenced to seven years transport for stealing a silver spoon. Canny where Evangeline is guileless, Hazel -- a skilled midwife and herbalist – is soon offering home remedies to both prisoners and sailors in return for a variety of favors.<br /><br />Though Australia has been home to Aboriginal people for more than 50,000 years, the British government in the 1840s considers its fledgling colony uninhabited and unsettled, and views the natives as an unpleasant nuisance. By the time the <em>Medea</em> arrives, many of them have been forcibly relocated, their land seized by white colonists. One of these relocated people is Mathinna, the orphaned daughter of the Chief of the Lowreenne tribe, who has been adopted by the new governor of Van Diemen’s Land.<br /><br />In this gorgeous novel, Christina Baker Kline brilliantly recreates the beginnings of a new society in a beautiful and challenging land, telling the story of Australia from a fresh perspective, through the experiences of Evangeline, Hazel, and Mathinna. While life in Australia is punishing and often brutally unfair, it is also, for some, an opportunity: for redemption, for a new way of life, for unimagined freedom. Told in exquisite detail and incisive prose, <em>The Exiles</em> is a story of grace born from hardship, the unbreakable bonds of female friendships, and the unfettering of legacy.<br /><br /><br /><br />  <br />",4.17, ,Kindle Edition, ,147,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53533806-the-exiles,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53533806-the-exiles

There used to be, in the wild, dark days before the burnings began, but now witching is nothing but tidy charms and nursery rhymes. If the modern woman wants any measure of power, she must find it at the ballot box.<br /><br />But when the Eastwood sisters--James Juniper, Agnes Amaranth, and Beatrice Belladonna--join the suffragists of New Salem, they begin to pursue the forgotten words and ways that might turn the women's movement into the witch's movement. Stalked by shadows and sickness, hunted by forces who will not suffer a witch to vote-and perhaps not even to live-the sisters will need to delve into the oldest magics, draw new alliances, and heal the bond between them if they want to survive.<br /><br />There's no such thing as witches.
