To brave young Thomas, the only survivor, the horror of the attack is epitomized in the casual savagery of a particular black-clad knight, whose flag -- three yellow hawks on a blue field -- presides over the bloody affair. As the killers sail away, Thomas vows to avenge the murder of his townspeople and to recapture a holy treasure that the black knight stole from the church.<br /><br />To do this, Thomas of Hookton must first make his way to France; So in 1343 he joins the army of King Edward III as it is about to invade the continent -- the beginning of the Hundred Years War. A preternaturally gifted bowman, Thomas quickly becomes recognized as one of England's most deadly archers in King Edward's march across France. Yet he never stops scanning the horizon for his true enemy's flag.<br /><br />When Thomas saves a young Frenchwoman from a bloodthirsty crowd, her father -- French nobleman Sir Guillaume d'Evecque -- rewards his bravery by joining him in the hunt for the mysterious dark knight and the stolen holy relic. What begins as a search for vengeance will soon prove the beginning of an even higher purpose: the quest for the Holy Grail itself.",4.13,400,Paperback, ,668,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68531.The_Archer_s_Tale,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68531.The_Archer_s_Tale

P. Lovecraft’s last major story, written in a four-month period from November 1934 to February 1935. It was first published in Astounding Stories for June 1936. And yet, this text has never been published as Lovecraft wrote it – until now. The recent discovery of Lovecraft’s handwritten manuscript allows readers to appreciate this magnificently cosmic story exactly as originally written. All previous editions of the story contain hundreds of serious errors, including errors in paragraphing, omissions and mistranscriptions of many words and passages, and erroneous punctuation. But now, the breathtaking scope of this novella – the story of the Great Race’s conquest of time and space by means of mind-projection, and the hapless fate of Professor Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee as a victim of the Great Race’s quest for all the secrets of the universe – can, for the first time, be fully understood. Leading Lovecraft scholars S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz have provided an exhaustive introduction and commentary on the story, elucidating names, places, and other elements in this richly evocative story. A must for all devotees of Lovecraft and weird fiction.",3.90,95,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68822.Orden_Y_Caos_Iv,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68822.Orden_Y_Caos_Iv

So when Roy Disney, chairman of Walt Disney Animation and nephew of founder Walt Disney, abruptly resigned in November 2003 and declared war on chairman and chief executive Michael Eisner, he sent shock waves through the entertainment industry, corporate boardrooms, theme parks, and living rooms around the world—everywhere Disney does business and its products are cherished.<br /><br />Drawing on unprecedented access to both Eisner and Roy Disney, current and former Disney executives and board members, as well as thousands of pages of never-before-seen letters, memos, transcripts, and other documents, James B. Stewart gets to the bottom of mysteries that have enveloped Disney for years: What really caused the rupture with studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, a man who once regarded Eisner as a father but who became his fiercest rival? How could Eisner have so misjudged Michael Ovitz, a man who was not only “the most powerful man in Hollywood” but also his friend, whom he appointed as Disney president and immediately wanted to fire? What caused the break between Eisner and Pixar chairman Steve Jobs, and why did Pixar abruptly abandon its partnership with Disney? Why did Eisner so mistrust Roy Disney that he assigned Disney company executives to spy on him? How did Eisner control the Disney board for so long, and what really happened in the fateful board meeting in September 2004, when Eisner played his last cards? <br /><br />DisneyWar is an enthralling tale of one of America’s most powerful media and entertainment companies, the people who control it, and those trying to overthrow them.

Meanwhile, the Ystad police station is experiencing a summer lull. Inspector Kurt Wallander is focusing on living healthier, but his peace of mind is shattered when a fellow officer is murdered. The police slowly realize how little they know about what is going on in their seemingly serene town. An unknown killer is on the loose, but their only lead is a photograph of three dead young people in costume. Forced to dig more deeply than he'd like into the personal life of one of his colleagues, Wallander's investigation uncovers something he could never have imagined.",4.09,0,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69261.Pisando_los_talones,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69261.Pisando_los_talones

Mrs. Hawkins, the majestic narrator of A Far Cry from Kensington, takes us well in hand and leads us back to her threadbare years in postwar London. There, as a fat and much admired young war widow, she spent her days working for a mad, near-bankrupt publisher (""of very good books"") and her nights dispensing advice at her small South Kensington rooming house. At work and at home Mrs. Hawkins soon uncovered evil: shady literary doings and a deadly enemy; anonymous letters, blackmail, and suicide. With aplomb, however, Mrs. Hawkins confidently set about putting things to order, little imagining the mayhem that would ensue. Now decades older, thin, successful, and delighted with life in Italy--quite a far cry from Kensington--Mrs. Hawkins looks back to all those dark doings and recounts how her own life changed forever.

Sunny Randall joins forces with the most important man in her life-her father-to crack a thirty-year-old case. <br /><br /> <i>Hi Phil,<br /> You miss me? I got bored, so I thought I'd reestablish our relationship. Give us both something to do in our later years. Stay tuned.<br /> Spare Change</i> <br /><br /> When a serial murderer dubbed ""The Spare Change Killer"" by the Boston press surfaces after three decades in hiding, the police immediately seek out the cop, now retired, who headed the original task force: Phil Randall. As a sharp-eyed investigator and a doting parent (""You're smart. You're tough. You, too, are a paradigm of law enforcement perfection, and you're my kid""), Phil calls on his daughter, Sunny, to help catch the criminal who eluded him so many years before. <br /><br /> Sunny is certain that she's found her man after interviewing just a handful of suspects. Though she has no evidence against Bob Johnson, she trusts her intuition. And she knows the power she has over him-she can feel the skittishness and sexual tension that he radiates when he's around her-but persuading her father and the rest of the task force is a different story. <br /><br /> When the killer strikes a second and third time, the murders take a macabre turn, as the victims each eerily resemble Sunny. While her father pressures her to drop the case, Sunny's need to create a trap to nab her killer grows. <br /><br /> In a compelling game of cat-and-mouse, Sunny uses all her skills to draw out her prey, realizing too late that she's setting herself up to become the next victim.",3.82,291,Hardcover, ,43,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69627.Spare_Change,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69627.Spare_Change

Quiero contar la historia puntual de un episodio de mi vida que no deja de ofrecer algún interés; aunque mi impericia en el arte de escribir quizá llegue a quitárselo. Los sucesos que voy a confiar al papel son tan recientes, que el eco de sus vibraciones aún no se ha apagado en mi alma. Esto hará seguramente más confusa la narración. No han tenido tiempo a depositarse los sedimentos y no es fácil sumergir en esta época importante de mi vida la mirada y distinguir lo que debe tomarse y dejarse para hacer comprensivas y gratas estas confidencias. Pero, en cambio, palpitará en ellas la verdad, y a su mágico influjo tal vez se disipen y se borren las infinitas manchas que mi pluma habrá dejado caer. Ante todo, es bien que os informe de quién soy, cuál es mi patria y mi condición. Estadme atentos. Confieso que soy gallego, del riñón mismo de Galicia, pues que nací en un pueblecillo de la provincia de Orense, llamado Bollo. Mi padre, boticario de este pueblo, no tiene más hijo que yo, y ha labrado para mí una fortuna que, si en Madrid significa poco, en Bollo nos constituye casi en potentados. Cursé la segunda enseñanza en Orense, y la facultad de medicina en Santiago. Mi padre hubiera deseado que fuese farmacéutico, pero nunca tuve afición a machacar y envolver drogas. Además, en el instituto de Orense observé que mis compañeros tenían por más noble ejercicio el de la medicina, y esto me decidió enteramente a desviarme de la profesión de mi padre. Así que hube terminado la carrera, solicité y obtuve de él, no sin algún trabajo, la venia para cursar el año del doctorado en Madrid, y a la Corte me vine, donde en vez de dar consistencia a mis conocimientos, no muy seguros por cierto, en las ciencias médicas, perdí bastante tiempo en los cafés, y lo que es aún peor, contraje la funesta manía de la literatura. Quiso mi suerte que fuese a dar con mis huesos a una casa de huéspedes donde alojaba también un autor dramático al por menor, esto es, de los que fabrican piezas para los teatros por horas, el cual me comunicó al punto su inmensa veneración por el arte de recrear al público durante tres cuartos de hora, y un desprecio profundo por todo lo que respetaba y ponía sobre la cabeza anteriormente, por las ciencias exactas y naturales y por los hombres que las profesaban. Collantes, que así se llamaba el poeta, sonreía, no ya con desprecio, sino con verdadera lástima, cuando le hablaba de mis sabios maestros de Santiago, y hasta una vez tuvo la crueldad de tirarme de la lengua en el café delante de otros compañeros, literatos también, para que desahogase mi entusiasmo por Tejeiro y otros que a mí me parecían eminentes profesores. Dejáronme hablar cuanto quise, y cuando más acalorado estaba en el panegírico, soltaron a reír como locos, con lo cual quedé fuertemente avergonzado y confuso. Después que se hartaron de reír, pasaron a tratar de sus asuntos de teatro, pero todavía al despedirse me dijo uno de ellos: «Adiós, Sanjurjo, hasta la vista; otro día hablaremos con más espacio del Sr. Tejeiro», lo que hizo estallar de nuevo en carcajadas a sus amigos. La broma llegó al punto de que cuantas veces me encontraban en la calle, nunca dejaban de preguntarme por la salud de Tejeiro; y esto duró algunos meses. No había que hablar a aquellos jóvenes, que se reunían todas las tardes y todas las noches del año en torno de una mesa del café Oriental, de otra cosa que de teatros y comediantes.",3.35, ,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69783.La_hermana_San_Sulpicio,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69783.La_hermana_San_Sulpicio

The wife gains a measure of freedom, but how does the repressive, abandoned husband feel about that freedom? Set in the early 1900s in the fictional New England college town of Thrupp, and narrated by the pompous Nicholas Van Tassel, All He Ever Wanted is at once an academic satire, a period novel, and a tale of suspense. Shreve's ability to nimbly hop through genres brings a liveliness to this story of love gone depressingly wrong. Van Tassel is an undistinguished professor of rhetoric at Thrupp College and a confirmed bachelor when he meets--in no less flamy a scenario than a hotel fire--the arresting Miss Etna Bliss. Immediately smitten, he woos and wins her. At least, he persuades her to become his wife. But Van Tassel hasn't really won her. Etna keeps her secrets and her feelings to herself. The extent of her withholding only becomes clear after a couple of kids and a decade or so of marriage. Then we find out that she's been creating a secret haven for herself all along. Van Tassel is in turn revealed--through his own priggish, puffed-up sentences--as something of a monster. The book is cleverly done; watching Etna through Van Tassel's eyes is like looking at beautiful bird from a hungry cat's point of view. But Van Tassel's voice might be too well written; he's pedantic and dull and snarky all at once, and by the end we find that we, like Etna, can't bear his company a minute longer. --Claire Dederer",3.20, , , ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70042.All_He_Ever_Wanted,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70042.All_He_Ever_Wanted

Escrita entre diciembre de 1948 y diciembre de 1950, en un principio fue editada por entregas en la revista francesa La Table Ronde. En el número de julio, el 43, se publicó la primera parte (Animula vagula blandula) en las páginas 71-84; Varius multiplex multiformis vio la luz en el nº 44, correspondiente al mes de agosto, y en las páginas 94-118, y la tercera, Tellus stabilita, fue publicada el mes siguiente, en el nº 45, y en la páginas 36-59; en todos los casos con la firma M.A. Dada la buena acogida que recibió la edición por entregas, la novela completa fue publicada también en Francia bajo el sello de la editorial Plon, y se puso a la venta el 5 de diciembre de 1951. El libro tuvo un éxito inmediato, con buenas críticas y excelente acogida por parte del público, y desde entonces no ha dejado de reeditarse en muchos idiomas, siendo el título más conocido de su autora. El 17 de mayo de 1952, recibe el Prémio Fémina Vacaresco, galardón que Marguerite recogerá en junio de ese año en el Hotel Ritz de París. El éxito se traduce en multitud de ediciones, así por ejemplo, entre 1951 y 1958, la editorial Plon llegó a tirar 96.500 ejemplares, y bajo el sello Gallimard (editorial francesa que ahora reúne todos los títulos de la autora), se habían tirado hasta 1989 algo más de 800.000 ejemplares. Entre las muchas traducciones que ha tenido esta obra, merecen la pena destacarse la versión inglesa, realizada por Grace Frick, compañera de Yourcenar, y la de Julio Cortázar en español, absolutamente magnífica. En la novela, se mencionan unas Memorias que Adriano publicó en vida con el nombre de su liberto Flegón, hoy perdidas, y que sirvieron de base para dos de las fuentes clásicas sobre la vida del emperador: el capítulo correspondiente de la Historia romana de Dión Casio, y la Vita Hadriani, dentro de la Historia Augusta, escrita por Elio Esparciano. La narración, que comienza con la fórmula: Querido Marco, adopta la manera de una larga epístola dividida en capítulos (Animula Vagula Blandula, Varius Multiplex Multiformis, Tellus Stabilita, Saeculum Aureum, Discilina Augusta y Patientia), y va dirigida a su sucesor, Marco Aurelio, a quien Adriano había adoptado como nieto, al hacerlo adoptar a su vez por su hijo adoptivo y sucesor inmediato, Antonino Pío. En ella, el emperador medita y reflexiona acerca de sus años de reinado, de sus triunfos militares, del amor, de la amistad, de la poesía, de la música, del arte, de los viajes, de la paz, de la pasión por su joven amante Antínoo y del dolor causado por su muerte, todo ello de una manera consistente, pero no exenta de esa «melancolía del mundo antiguo» a la que aludiera Gustave Flaubert. A este respecto, Yourcenar anotó en los Cuadernos de notas a las Memorias de Adriano la conocida frase del escritor francés: «cuando los dioses ya no existían y Cristo no había aparecido aún, hubo un momento único, desde Cicerón a Marco Aurelio, en que solo estuvo el hombre». Como ella misma confesaba: «gran parte de mi vida transcurriría en el intento de definir, después de retratar, a ese hombre solo y al mismo tiempo vinculado con todo.»",4.25,246,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70050.Memorias_de_Adriano,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70050.Memorias_de_Adriano

The present volume is an unabridged English translation of the 13th French edition of that historic manifesto, in which Le Corbusier expounded his technical and aesthetic theories, views on industry, economics, relation of form to function, the ""mass-production spirit,"" and much else. A principal prophet of the ""modern"" movement in architecture, and a near-legendary figure of the ""International School,"" he designed some of the twentieth century's most memorable buildings: Chapel at Ronchamp; Swiss dormitory at the Cité Universitaire, Paris; Unité d'Habitation, Marseilles; and many more.<br /><br />Le Corbusier brought great passion and intelligence to these essays, which present his ideas in a concise, pithy style, studded with epigrammatic, often provocative, observations: ""American engineers overwhelm with their calculations our expiring architecture.""

An intriguing exchange of ideas and techniques between commercial photography and art photography and, more specifically, between fashion and art photography has completely changed the idea of what a fashion photograph is and what it should look like. The focus is on defining a milieu rather than just clothing. <i>Fashioning Fiction in Photography Since 1990</i> presents a selection of high-profile fashion photographs influenced by two aesthetic strategies: cinema and the amateur photograph. The cinematic image, through its attention to drama and its reverence for tension and voyeurism, seduces a young audience whose primary visual points of reference are film and television. The amateur photograph, including the family album picture, provides seemingly offhand documentation of the activities of friends and associates in the lives of photographers, blurring the line between pictures made for hire and those made as personal keepsakes. This groundbreaking book, and the exhibition it accompanies, includes lavish illustrations of the work by photographers such as Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Cedric Buchet, Glen Luchford, Tina Barney, Juergen Teller, Nan Goldin and Larry Sultan, among others. The principal essay, by Susan Kismaric, Curator, and Eva Respini, Assistant Curator, in the Department of Photography at The Museum of Modern Art, explores the nature of fashion photography in the last decade, and the work of the photographers presented in this volume. A second essay, by Dennis Freedman, Vice Chairman and Creative Director of <i>w</i> magazine, discusses the subject from within the fashion industry and provides an intimate view of the creation of the promotional campaigns and the imagery of fashion.",4.00,144,Hardcover, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70215.Fashioning_Fiction_in_Photography_Since_1990,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70215.Fashioning_Fiction_in_Photography_Since_1990

Not only had the imperial tradition been restored with the Meiji Restoration in 1868, but some forms of democratic parliamentary institutions had been set up. However, during the years that followed, the so-called imperial democracy came under pressure as the Japanese sought to impose tight control over not only their own people but their neighbours as well. This impressive survey looks at developments at home, Japan's aggressive foreign policy particularly in China during the 1930s and 1940s, and her role in the Second World War.

This book offers the hidden story behind these and other questions, as economist Tim Harford ranges from Africa, Asia, Europe, and of course the United States to reveal how supermarkets, airlines, and coffee chains--to name just a few--are vacuuming money from our wallets. Harford punctures the myths surrounding some of today's biggest controversies, including the high cost of health-care; he reveals why certain environmental laws can put a smile on a landlord's face; and he explains why some industries can have high profits for innocent reasons, while in other industries something sinister is going on. Covering an array of economic concepts including scarce resources, market power, efficiency, price gouging, market failure, inside information, and game theory, Harford sheds light on how these forces shape our day-to-day lives, often without our knowing it. <br /> Showing us the world through the eyes of an economist, Tim Harford reveals that everyday events are intricate games of negotiations, contests of strength, and battles of wits.

The majority of these people were black; nearly all were poor. The Federal government's slow response to local appeals for help is by now notorious. Yet despite the cries of outrage that have mounted since the levees broke, we have failed to confront the disaster's true lesson: to be poor, or black, in today's ownership society, is to be left behind. Displaying the intellectual rigor, political passion, and personal empathy that have won him acclaim and fans all across the color line, Michael Eric Dyson offers a searing assessment of the meaning of Hurricane Katrina. Combining interviews with survivors of the disaster with his deep knowledge of black migrations and government policy over decades, Dyson provides the historical context that has been sorely missing from public conversation. He explores the legacy of black suffering in America since slavery and ties its psychic scars to today's crisis. And, finally, his critique of the way black people are framed in the national consciousness will shock and surprise even the most politically savvy reader. With this clarion call Dyson warns us that we can only find redemption as a society if we acknowledge that Katrina was more than an engineering or emergency response failure.

As it became clear that these horrifying acts had been committed in the name of religion, the media, the government, and ordinary citizens alike sought answers to questions about Islam and its adherents.<br />In this level-headed and authoritative book, John L. Esposito, one of the world's most respected scholars of political Islam, provides answers. He clearly and carefully explains the teachings of Islam--the Quran, the example of the Prophet, Islamic law--about jihad or holy war, the use of violence, and terrorism. He chronicles the rise of extremist groups and examines their frightening worldview and tactics. Anti-Americanism (and anti-Europeanism), he shows, is a broad-based phenomenon that cuts across Arab and Muslim societies. It is not just driven by religious zealotry, but by frustration and anger at U.S. policy. It is vital to understand, however, that the vast majority of Muslims are appalled by the acts of violence committed in the name of their faith. It is essential that we distinguish between the religion of Islam and the actions of extremists like Osama bin Laden, who hijack Islamic discourse and belief to justify their acts of terrorism. This brief, clear-sighted book reflects twenty years of study, reflection, and experience on the part of a scholar who is equally respected in the West and in the Muslim world. It will prove to be the best single guide to the urgent questions that have recently forced themselves on the attention of the entire world.<br />",3.55,196,Paperback, ,24,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70473.Unholy_War,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70473.Unholy_War

In a rich, eloquent voice that resonates with both small-town wisdom and haut monde sophistication, Talley tells of the grandmother who encouraged his dreams and ambitions while instilling in him an abiding sense of dignity and style, and of the legendary fashion doyenne who took him under her wing as he rose to fame in the wild New York of the 1970s.

The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did)—if you do not already know all about these things—much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period. For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare.

In well-drawn historical portraits, Ngai peoples her study with the Filipinos, Mexicans, Japanese, and Chinese who comprised, variously, illegal aliens, alien citizens, colonial subjects, and imported contract workers. She shows that immigration restriction, particularly national-origin and numerical quotas, re-mapped the nation both by creating new categories of racial difference and by emphasizing as never before the nation's contiguous land borders and their patrol. This yielded the illegal alien, a new legal and political subject whose inclusion in the nation was a social reality but a legal impossibility--a subject without rights and excluded from citizenship. Questions of fundamental legal status created new challenges for liberal democratic society and have directly informed the politics of multiculturalism and national belonging in our time.<br /><br />Ngai's analysis is based on extensive archival research, including previously unstudied records of the U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Naturalization Service.

It is the tragic monologue of a woman speaking with the child she carries in her womb. This letter confronts the burning theme of abortion, and the meaning of life, by asking difficult questions: Is it fair to impose life even if it means suffering? Would it be better not to be born at all?<br />Letter to a Child Never Born touches on the real meaning of being a woman: the power to give life or not. When the book begins, the protagonist is upset after learning she is pregnant. She knows nothing about the child, except that this creature depends totally and uniquely on her own choices. The creation of another person directly within one’s own body is a very shocking thing. The sense of responsibility is huge; it is a heavy burden that gives life to endless reflections, from the origin of our existence to the shame of our selfishness. If the child could choose, would he prefer to be born, to grow up, and to suffer, or would he return to the joyful limbo from which he came? A woman’s freedom and individuality are also challenged by a newborn—should she renounce her freedom, her job, and her choice? What should she do at this point?",3.93,0,Paperback, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70689.Letter_to_a_Child_Never_Born,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70689.Letter_to_a_Child_Never_Born

Andrew strives for a better world through his life-saving work as a doctor. Heidi, a social worker, is in need of a challenge and a paycheck, and Ken is fresh from Harvard and brimful of idealism. As their stories interweave through the years, from Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia to Haiti, the trio reveal a world of witnessed atrocities, primal fear, desperate loneliness and base desires. They fend off terror and futility with revelry, humour and sex; ask hard questions about the world order America has created, the true power of the UN, and whether there is any possibility for change.<br /><br />This is a startling celebration of the power of humour and friendship, of the limits of human compassion, and the need for a warm body and a cold beer during a Condition Echo lockdown.

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.</p><p>Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up—at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.</p><p>The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before—hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.</p><p><i>In Veronika Decides to Die,</i> Paulo Coelho takes reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, andpervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, <i>Veronkia Decides to Die</i> questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.</p><p>Author Biography: </p><p>Paulo Coelho was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the city where he now lives. His own life has in many ways been as varied and unusual as the protagonists of his internationally acclaimed novels. Like them, Paulo Coelho has followed a dream in a quest for fulfillment. His own dream, to be a writer, met with frustration throughout much of his early adult life, a time in which he worked at various professions, some of them materially rewarding but spiritually unfulfilling. ""I always knew,"" he says, ""that my Personal Legend, to use a term from alchemy, was to write."" He was 38 when he published his first book.</p><p>In 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him, he traveled through much of South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe. Returning to Brazil after two years, he began a successful career as popular songwriter. In 1974, he was imprisoned for a short time by the military dictatorship then ruling in Brazil. In 1980, he experienced one of the defining moments of his life: he walked the 500-plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. On this ancient highway, used for centuries by pilgrims from France to get to the cathedral said to house the remains of St. James, he achieved a self-awareness and a spiritual awakening that he later described in The Pilgrimage. </p><p>Paulo Coelho once said that following your dream is like learning a foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in the end. In 1988, he published <i>The Alchemist</i>, a novel that explores this theme, and it launched him as an international bestselling author. Specifically, Paulo Coelho is recognized for his powerful storytelling technique and the profound spiritual insights he blends seamlessly into his parables. Since then, <i>The Alchemist</i> has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and has been translated into some 41 languages. In addition to <i>The Pilgrimage</i> and <i>The Alchemist</i>, Paulo Coelho has written luminous novels about the different streams of our lives, including <i>By The River Piedra I Sat Down &amp; Wept</i>, <i>The Valkyries</i>, <i>The Fifth Mountain</i>, and <i>Veronika Decides to Die.</i> A winner of numerous literary prizes, Paulo Coelho is also a prominent speaker for humanitarian causes. In 1999, he received a Crystal Award for Artistic Achievement at the Davos Economic Forum Conference.</p>",3.70,192,Paperback, ,14,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71137.Veronika_Decides_to_Die,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71137.Veronika_Decides_to_Die

With the narrative power of fiction, Donald Miller takes readers on a harrowing ride through the fire-filled skies over Berlin, Hanover, and Dresden and describes the terrible cost of bombing for the German people.<br /><br />Fighting at 25,000 feet in thin, freezing air that no warriors had ever encountered before, bomber crews battled new kinds of assaults on body and mind. Air combat was deadly but intermittent: periods of inactivity and anxiety were followed by short bursts of fire and fear. Unlike infantrymen, bomber boys slept on clean sheets, drank beer in local pubs, and danced to the swing music of Glenn Miller's Air Force band, which toured U.S. air bases in England. But they had a much greater chance of dying than ground soldiers. In 1943, an American bomber crewman stood only a one-in-five chance of surviving his tour of duty, twenty-five missions. The Eighth Air Force lost more men in the war than the U.S. Marine Corps.<br /><br />The bomber crews were an elite group of warriors who were a microcosm of America -- white America, anyway. (African-Americans could not serve in the Eighth Air Force except in a support capacity.) The actor Jimmy Stewart was a bomber boy, and so was the ""King of Hollywood,"" Clark Gable. And the air war was filmed by Oscar-winning director William Wyler and covered by reporters like Andy Rooney and Walter Cronkite, all of whom flew combat missions with the men. The Anglo-American bombing campaign against Nazi Germany was the longest military campaign of World War II, a war within a war. Until Allied soldiers crossed into Germany in the final months of the war, it was the only battle fought inside the German homeland.<br /><br />Strategic bombing did not win the war, but the war could not have been won without it. American airpower destroyed the rail facilities and oil refineries that supplied the German war machine. The bombing campaign was a shared enterprise: the British flew under the cover of night while American bombers attacked by day, a technique that British commanders thought was suicidal.<br /><br /><i>Masters of the Air</i> is a story, as well, of life in wartime England and in the German prison camps, where tens of thousands of airmen spent part of the war. It ends with a vivid description of the grisly hunger marches captured airmen were forced to make near the end of the war through the country their bombs destroyed.<br /><br />Drawn from recent interviews, oral histories, and American, British, German, and other archives, Masters of the Air is an authoritative, deeply moving account of the world's first and only bomber war.",3.66,671,Hardcover, ,151,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71318.Masters_of_the_Air,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71318.Masters_of_the_Air

La respuesta nos la da este libro, en donde el autor se apresura a reírse de todo ante el temor de que todo le haga llorar y que entre dos angustias opta siempre por el humor en su afán de relativizar el dramatismo de la finitud humana y de trascenderlo por vía de la paradoja. Como Martín Romaña, personaje de una de sus más conocidas novelas, estas «antimemorias» nos dicen constantemente hasta qué punto su autor es un solitario que ha vivido en excelente compañía y que el infierno son los demás, pero también el paraíso. Cualquier sistema es, para Bryce Echenique, una camisa de fuerza cuando se insiste en él de una manera total y carente de humor. ""Permiso para vivir"" es un libro que está contra la confidencia y a favor de la confesión. Sólo ésta le permite demoler pirámides hasta reducirlas a los miserables escombros que constituyen una vida humana. Y así, sin querer queriendo, como cuenta Bryce Echenique que empezó este libro tan despiadado como lleno de humor y ternura, logra darnos toda una imagen de su vida sentimental e intelectual en la que se suceden países, personajes y acontecimientos en un desorden temporal tan rico y variado como los vaivenes de una memoria desacralizadora.<br /><br />In the book, the ""I"" narrator request permission to life and tell the life's story to Bryce Echenique the writer in a sentimental journey that goes from childhood to adulthood, his lovers, friends and where humor and nostalgia share a common stage in this journey.",3.80,532,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71489.Permiso_Para_Vivir,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71489.Permiso_Para_Vivir

Also known as Miriam of Magdala, Mary Magdalene was considered by the apostle John to be the founder of Christianity because she was the first witness to the Resurrection. In most theological studies she has been depicted as a reformed prostitute, the redeemed sinner who exemplifies Christ's mercy. Today's reader can ponder her role in the gospels of Philip, Thomas, Peter, and Bartholomew--the collection of what have come to be known as the Gnostic gospels rejected by the early Christian church. Mary's own gospel is among these, but until now it has remained unknown to the public at large.<br /><br />Orthodox theologian Jean-Yves Leloup's translation of the Gospel of Mary from the Coptic and his thorough and profound commentary on this text are presented here for the first time in English. The gospel text and the spiritual exegesis of Leloup together reveal unique teachings that emphasize the eminence of the divine feminine and an abiding love of nature over the dualistic and ascetic interpretations of Christianity presented elsewhere. What emerges from this important source text and commentary is a renewal of the sacred feminine in the Western spiritual tradition and a new vision for Christian thought and faith throughout the world.",4.09,208,Paperback, ,94,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71649.The_Gospel_of_Mary_Magdalene,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71649.The_Gospel_of_Mary_Magdalene

Se configura como una sucesión de escenas dialogadas entre dos presos recluidos en una misma celda de una prisión bonaerense.

La confrontación entre los dos hombres se resolverá en una profunda transformación interior, para cerrarse en un sacrificio estéril sólo en apariencia: inmolándose verán al fin su verdadero rostro, llegarán a ser ellos mismos.<br /><br />El beso de la mujer araña consolidó la fama de Manuel Puig en el ámbito internacional gracias al extraordinario éxito de su versión cinematográfica y teatral, y fue, también, su novela más popular.

A crab sandwich by the sea on a June afternoon; a slice of roast goose with apple sauce and roast potatoes on Christmas Day; hot sausages and a chunk of roast pumpkin on a frost-sparkling night in November. These are meals whose success relies not on the expertise of the cook but on the more basic premise that this is the food of the moment--something eaten at a time when it is most appropriate, when the ingredients are at their peak of perfection, when the food, the cook and the time of year are at one with each other.""<br /> —Nigel Slater, <i>The Kitchen Diaries</i> <br /><br /> Nigel Slater writes about food in a way that stimulates the imagination, the heart, and the palate all at once. <i>The Kitchen Diaries</i> brings an especially personal ingredient to the mix, letting us glimpse his pantry, tour local farmers’ markets with him, and savor even the simplest meals at his table. <p> Recording twelve months in his culinary life, Slater shares seasonal dishes and the intriguing elements behind them. As someone who celebrates each visit to the cheese shop or butcher, he enthusiastically conveys the brilliant array of choices and encourages his view of food shopping as an adventure rather than a chore. A rainy day in February calls for a hearty stew; summertime finds him feasting on a lunch as simple as baked tomatoes with grated Parmesan. If an exotic mood strikes him, slow-roasted duck with star anise and ginger is in order. In <i>The Kitchen Diaries</i>, Nigel interweaves his meditations on how food should be enjoyed and prepared with his delicious recipes.

Someone is trying to kill her and at last she has decided to trust Ruth with her story. Ruth, meanwhile, is struggling to make sense of her own life as a young single mother with an unfinished graduate degree and escalating dependence on alcohol. She is drawn deeper and deeper into the astonishing events of her mother’s past—the mysterious death of Eva’s beloved brother, her work in New York City manipulating the press in order to shift public sentiment toward American involvement in the war, and her dangerous romantic entanglement. Now Sally wants to find the man who recruited her for the secret service, and she needs Ruth’s help.<br /><br /><i>Restless</i> is a brilliant espionage book and a vivid portrait of the life of a female spy.

But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard ""accidentally"" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works.

Brilliantly capturing the terrifying drama of catastrophe, Egan does equal justice to the human characters who become his heroes, “the stoic, long-suffering men and women whose lives he opens up with urgency and respect” (New York Times).<br /><br />In an era that promises ever-greater natural disasters, The Worst Hard Time is “arguably the best nonfiction book yet” (Austin Statesman Journal) on the greatest environmental disaster ever to be visited upon our land and a powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of trifling with nature.",4.03,340,Paperback, ,4203,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72223.The_Worst_Hard_Time,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72223.The_Worst_Hard_Time

He’s a sociopath. And your boss, teacher, and colleague? They may be sociopaths too.<br /><br />We are accustomed to think of sociopaths as violent criminals, but in <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i>, Harvard psychologist Martha Stout reveals that a shocking 4 percent of ordinary people—one in twenty-five—has an often undetected mental disorder, the chief symptom of which is that that person possesses no conscience. He or she has no ability whatsoever to feel shame, guilt, or remorse. One in twenty-five everyday Americans, therefore, is secretly a sociopath. They could be your colleague, your neighbor, even family. And they can do literally anything at all and feel absolutely no guilt. <i>
  <br />
</i><br />How do we recognize the remorseless? One of their chief characteristics is a kind of glow or charisma that makes sociopaths more charming or interesting than the other people around them. They’re more spontaneous, more intense, more complex, or even sexier than everyone else, making them tricky to identify and leaving us easily seduced. Fundamentally, sociopaths are different because they cannot love. Sociopaths learn early on to show sham emotion, but underneath they are indifferent to others’ suffering. They live to dominate and thrill to win. <br /><br />The fact is, we all almost certainly know at least one or more sociopaths already. Part of the urgency in reading <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i> is the moment when we suddenly recognize that someone we know—someone we worked for, or were involved with, or voted for—is a sociopath. But what do we do with that knowledge? To arm us against the sociopath, Dr. Stout teaches us to question authority, suspect flattery, and beware the pity play. Above all, she writes, when a sociopath is beckoning, do not join the game. <br /><br />It is the ruthless versus the rest of us, and <i>The Sociopath Next Door</i> will show you how to recognize and defeat the devil you know.",3.76,256,Paperback, ,2221,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72536.The_Sociopath_Next_Door,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72536.The_Sociopath_Next_Door

""She lifts the lace curtain from Victorian society, "" Sharyn McCrumb has said, ""to reveal its shocking secrets."" Like her last William Monk novel, this one brilliantly evokes England's nineteenth-century legal justice system and builds to a heart-stopping courtroom drama. In a sunny garden, in a pleasant London suburb, a young woman is brutally raped. In a London hospital, another young woman, a talented nurse who had been one of Florence Nightingale's angels of mercy in the Crimean War, meets a sudden, fearful death by strangulation. William Monk, no longer a policeman but a private inquiry agent, is engaged to investigate these horrific crimes. The first is readily, if tragically, resolved. The murder of Nurse Prudence Barrymore, however, presents greater difficulties. Even the victim's mother agrees that a rebellious young woman who flouts the traditional roles of marriage and motherhood to work in a filthy hospital must expect a bad end. In the brutal squalor of a Victorian hospital, death in any shape, even murder, can be no surprise. But Monk's intuition tells him that Prudence Barrymore's murder is no random stroke of violence by a madman. Greatly helped by Hester Latterly, a nurse who knew Prudence on the battlefield, Monk assembles the portrait of a remarkable woman. He also discerns the shadow of a tragic evil that darkens every level of society, and a frightening glimmer of his own eclipsed past. It all leads Monk, and the reader, to a denouement that ranks with Anne Perry's best, as apacked audience waits breathlessly in the Old Bailey for the outcome of a sensational trial.",3.96,464,Paperback, ,208,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72737.A_Sudden_Fearful_Death,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72737.A_Sudden_Fearful_Death

With insight, compassion, and a portraitist’s genius, Perry illuminates the shifting tide of emotions encompassing Queen Victoria’s London and the people who live there—aristocrats, brothel owners, thieves, Dickensian ruffians, and their evil keepers. She takes us through dangerous backstreets where the poor eke out their humble livings, and into the mansions of the rich, safe and secure in their privileged lives. Or so they believe. . . .<br /><br />William Monk knows London’s streets like the back of his hand; after all, they are where he earns his living. But the river Thames and its teeming docks— where towering schooners and clipper ships unload their fabulous cargoes and wharf rats and night plunderers ply their trades—is unknown territory.<br /><br />Only dire need persuades him to accept an assignment from shipping magnate Clement Louvain to investigate the theft of a cargo of African ivory from Louvain’s recently docked schooner, the <i>Maude Idris</i>. Monk is desperate for work, not only to feed himself and his wife, Hester, but to keep open the doors of Hester’s clinic, a last resort for sick and starving street women.<br /><br />But he wonders: Why didn’t Louvain report the ivory theft directly to the River Police? Why did he warn Monk not to investigate the murder of one of the <i>Maude Idris</i> crew? Even more mysterious, why has Louvain brought to Hester’s clinic a desperately ill woman who he claims is the discarded mistress of an old friend? Neither Hester nor Monk anticipates the nightmare answers to these questions . . . nor the trap that soon so fatefully ensnares them.<br /><br />In this magnificent novel, Anne Perry holds the reader spellbound, as Monk and Hester struggle to save themselves and their world from a catastrophe whose dimensions they can scarcely measure.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",4.08,339,Paperback, ,145,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72738.The_Shifting_Tide,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/72738.The_Shifting_Tide

It is a story of a ruthless dictator and his schemes to dispose of a political adversary in an unnamed Latin American country usually identified as Guatemala. The book has been acclaimed for portraying both a totalitarian government and its damaging psychological effects. Drawing from his experiences as a journalist writing under repressive conditions, Asturias employs such literary devices as satire to convey the government’s transgressions and surrealistic dream sequences to demonstrate the police state’s impact on the individual psyche. Asturias’s stance against all forms of injustice in Guatemala caused critics to view the author as a compassionate spokesperson for the oppressed. My work,” Asturias promised when he accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, “will continue to reflect the voice of the people, gathering their myths and popular beliefs and at the same time seeking to give birth to a universal consciousness of Latin American problems.”",3.99,286,Paperback, ,106,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73723.The_President,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73723.The_President

With bracing directness and aphoristic authority, one of our greatest living playwrights addresses the questions: What makes good drama? And why does drama matter in an age that is awash in information and entertainment? David Mamet believes that the tendency to dramatize is essential to human nature, that we create drama out of everything from today’s weather to next year’s elections. But the highest expression of this drive remains the theater.<br />          With a cultural range that encompasses Shakespeare, Bretcht, and Ibsen, <i>Death of a Salesman</i> and <i>Bad Day at Black Rock</i>, Mamet shows us how to distinguish true drama from its false variants. He considers the impossibly difficult progression between one act and the next and the mysterious function of the soliloquy. The result, in <i>Three Uses of the Knife</i>, is an electrifying treatise on the playwright’s art that is also a strikingly original work of moral and aesthetic philosophy. <br />",3.90,96,Paperback, ,131,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74203.Three_Uses_of_the_Knife,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74203.Three_Uses_of_the_Knife

A man may take Abraham Lincoln out of the grave—and meet another who puts him back. An amazing Electrical Grandmother may come to live with a grieving family. An old parrot may have learned over long evenings to imitate the voice of Ernest Hemingway, and became the last link to the great man. A priest on Mars may confront his fondest dream: to meet the Messiah.

This beautifully illustrated book conducts us through the splendors of this world, great and small, and into the mysteries of its fascination in its day as well as in our own. What did art, and the architecture that housed it, mean to the ancient Egyptians? Why did they invest such vast wealth and effort in its production? These are the puzzles Gay Robins explores as she examines the objects of Egyptian art--the tombs and wall paintings, the sculpture and stelae, the coffins, funerary papyri, and amulets--from its first flowering in the Early Dynastic period to its final resurgence in the time of the Ptolemies.<br /><br />Spanning three thousand years, her book offers a thorough and delightfully readable introduction to the art of ancient Egypt even as it provides insight into questions that have long perplexed experts and amateurs alike. With remarkable sensitivity to the complex ways in which historical, religious, and social changes are related to changes in Egyptian art, she brings out the power and significance of the image in Egyptian belief and life. Her attention to the later period, including Ptolemaic art, shows for the first time how Egyptian art is a continuous phenomenon, changing to meet the needs of different times, right down to the eclipse of ancient Egyptian culture. In its scope, its detail, and its eloquent reproduction of over 250 objects from the British Museum and other collections in Europe, the United States, and Egypt, this volume is without parallel as a guide to the art of ancient Egypt.",4.13,271,Paperback, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74617.The_Art_of_Ancient_Egypt,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74617.The_Art_of_Ancient_Egypt

In this delightful, superbly researched biography, award-winning historian Kathryn Hughes pulls back the lace curtains to reveal the woman behind the book--Mrs. Beeton, the first domestic diva of the modern age--and explores the life of the book itself.<br /><br />Isabella Beeton was a twenty-one-year-old newlywed with only six monthsâ€™ experience running her own home when--coaxed by her husband, a struggling publisher--she began to compile her book of recipes and domestic advice. The aspiring mother hardly suspected that her name would become synonymous with housewifery for generations.Â  Nor would the women who turned to the book for guidance ever have guessed that its author lived in a simple house in the suburbs with a single maid-of-all-work instead of presiding over a well-run estate. Isabella would die at twenty-eight, shortly after the book's publication, never knowing the extent of her legacy. <br /><br />As her survivors faced bankruptcy, sexual scandal and a bitter family feud that lasted more than a century, Mrs. Beetonâ€™s book became an institution. For an exploding population of the newly affluent, it prescribed not only how to cook and clean but ways to cope with the social flux of the emerging consumer culture: how to plan a party for ten, whip up a hair pomade or calculate how much money was needed to permit the hiring of a footman. In the twentieth century, Mrs. Beeton would be accused of plagiarism, blamed for the dire state of British cookery and used to market everything from biscuits to meat pies.<br /><br />This elegant, revelatory portrait of a lady journalist, as she lived and as she existed in the minds of her readers, is also a vivid picture of Victorian home life and its attendant anxieties, nostalgia, and aspirations--not so different from those felt in America today.",3.54,496,Hardcover, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74624.The_Short_Life_and_Long_Times_of_Mrs_Beeton,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74624.The_Short_Life_and_Long_Times_of_Mrs_Beeton

And when she reaches land, Centaine puts foot not in the lush world that Michael Courtney described to her, but on the edge of a burning desert--alone and fighting for her life.<br /><br />In a strange world, under a great rushing sky, Centaine sets forth in the company of wandering Bushmen--and then into the arms of a renegade white soldier who may be her savior or destruction. As Michael Courtney's family searches for Centaine, she comes near her promised land--and the untold tragedy and riches that it holds...</div>

For it is couched in such terms as to offer Benedict an instrument of destruction of his bitterest rival. 'Destroy Johnny' was the old man's implacable message to his son, and, obsessively jealous of his foster-brother, Benedict sets out in ruthless pursuit of this goal.<br /><br />In a desperate bid to support Johnny, Tracey acquires for him the concession in the diamond-rich seabed round the coral islands of Thunderbolt and Suicide off the savage South West African coast, and Johnny throws all his resources into the construction of a vessel that will recover the stones from the ocean floor and repair his fortune at last. But Benedict, already involved in illegal diamond-dealing as a sideline, seizes this chance to attack his rival and, with a network of accomplices and some ingenious electronic tampering, plots to syphon off the diamonds. Johnny will not only be ruined by his liabilities, he will also be a laughing stock.<br /><br />However, Benedict's obsessive jealousy is his undoing. He cannot resist stripping his rival of his beautiful but bitchy wife Ruby as well, and when he then discards her, she takes her revenge, precipitating a climax of murder and destruction that consumes Benedict at last.<br /><br />Narrated with Wilbur Smith's irresistible driving thrust, <i>The Diamond Hunters</i> is a tale of brotherly hatred, redeemed only by the deepening love between Johnny and Tracey.

It was one misery upon another. He lived in sand for six months, his girlfriend back home betrayed him for a scrawny hotel clerk, he was punished by boredom and fear, he considered suicide, he pulled a gun on one of his fellow marines, and he was shot at by both Iraqis and Americans. At the end of the war, Swofford hiked for miles through a landscape of incinerated Iraqi soldiers and later was nearly killed in a booby-trapped Iraqi bunker. </p><p> Swofford weaves this experience of war with vivid accounts of boot camp (which included physical abuse by his drill instructor), reflections on the mythos of the marines, and remembrances of battles with lovers and family. As engagement with the Iraqis draws closer, he is forced to consider what it is to be an American, a soldier, a son of a soldier, and a man. </p><p> Unlike the real-time print and television coverage of the Gulf War, which was highly scripted by the Pentagon, Swofford's account subverts the conventional wisdom that U.S. military interventions are now merely surgical insertions of superior forces that result in few American casualties. <i>Jarhead</i> insists we remember the Americans who are in fact wounded or killed, the fields of smoking enemy corpses left behind, and the continuing difficulty that American soldiers have reentering civilian life. </p><p> A harrowing yet inspiring portrait of a tormented consciousness struggling for inner peace, <i>Jarhead</i> will elbow for room on that short shelf of American war classics that includes Philip Caputo's <i>A Rumor of War</i> and Tim O'Brien's <i>The Things They Carried,</i> and be admired not only for the raw beauty of its prose but also for the depth of its pained heart.</p>",3.67,260,Paperback, ,515,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75060.Jarhead_,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75060.Jarhead_

More than anything else O'Connor ever wrote, this story mixes the comedy, violence, and religious concerns that characterize her fiction.<br /><br />This casebook for the story includes an introduction by the editor, a chronology of the author's life, the authoritative text of the story itself, comments and letters by O'Connor about the story, critical essays, and a bibliography. The critical essays span more than twenty years of commentary and suggest several approaches to the story--formalistic, thematic, deconstructionist-- all within the grasp of the undergraduate, while the introduction also points interested students toward still other resources.

She suggests that, often, research findings are deliberately obscure to placate special interests. Nestle says that simple, common-sense guidelines available decades ago still hold true: consume fewer calories, exercise more, eat more fruits and vegetables and, for today's consumers, less junk food. The key to eating well, Nestle advises, is to learn to navigate through the aisles (and thousands of items) in large supermarkets. To that end, she gives readers a virtual tour, highlighting the main concerns of each food group, including baby, health and prepared foods, and supplements. Nestle's prose is informative and entertaining; she takes on the role of detective, searching for clues to the puzzle of healthy and satisfying nutrition.

Industrial foods like corn syrup, which lurks everywhere from fruit juice to chicken broth, are to blame for the triple epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, not real food.<br /><br />Nina Planck grew up on a vegetable farm in Virginia and learned to eat right from her no-nonsense parents: along with lots of local fruits and vegetables, the Plancks drank raw milk and ate meatloaf, bacon, and eggs with impunity. But the nutritional trends ran the other way--fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol were taboo--and in her teens and twenties, Nina tried vegan, vegetarian, low-fat, and low-cholesterol diets, with unhappy results.<br /><br />When she opened the first farmers' markets in London, Nina began to eat real food again--for pleasure, not health--and to her surprise she lost weight and felt great. She began to wonder about the farmhouse diet back home. Was it deadly, as the cardiologists say?

In Female Masculinity Jack Halberstam takes aim at the protected status of male masculinity and shows that female masculinity has offered a distinct alternative to it for well over two hundred years. Providing the first full-length study on this subject, Halberstam catalogs the diversity of gender expressions among masculine women from nineteenth-century pre-lesbian practices to contemporary drag king performances.<p>Through detailed textual readings as well as empirical research, Halberstam uncovers a hidden history of female masculinities while arguing for a more nuanced understanding of gender categories that would incorporate rather than pathologize them. He rereads Anne Lister's diaries and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness as foundational assertions of female masculine identity. He considers the enigma of the stone butch and the politics surrounding butch/femme roles within lesbian communities. He also explores issues of transsexuality among ""transgender dykes""---lesbians who pass as men---and female-to-male transsexuals who may find the label of ""lesbian"" a temporary refuge. Halberstam also tackles such topics as women and boxing, butches in Hollywood and independent cinema, and the phenomenon of male impersonators.</p><p>Female Masculinity signals a new understanding of masculine behaviors and identities, and a new direction in interdisciplinary queer scholarship. Illustrated with nearly forty photographs, including portraits, film stills, and drag king performance shots, this book provides an extensive record of the wide range of female masculinities. And as Halberstam clearly demonstrates, female masculinity is not some bad imitation of virility, but a lively and dramatic staging of hybrid and minority genders.</p>",3.95,329,Paperback, ,80,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75407.Female_Masculinity,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75407.Female_Masculinity

Football is an unrelentingly punishing sport, played and practiced at undiminished intensity, and it devours its players. Confronting injuries, trades, and the grim reality of competition, every NFL team prepares constantly for the likelihood -- the certainty -- that even franchise players can go down at any time. And someone new must be ready, trained, and primed to step in at the highest level. <br /><br /> Bestselling sportswriter John Feinstein persuaded one NFL team to lift the extraordinary secrecy that shrouds the sport and let him see how a team operates at the closest level. One team let him join every practice, every coaches' meeting, every players' gathering, every strategy debate. From the give-and-take of draft day, into the grinder of summer training camps, and from 100-degree practice games to the last game in frigid conditions, Feinstein reveals how a football team works -- or fails to work -- as no writer has done before. <br /><br /><i>Next Man Up</i> unveils rituals (what a coach tells a player at the moment he cuts him); rules (the inanities of league-appointed ""uniform Nazis""); conflicts (the scouts vs. the coaches, the general managers vs. the agents, the offense vs. the defense, the special teams coaches vs. everybody); money (how much a journeyman makes, and how his life differs from the multi-million-dollar-a-year star players)-every nuance of a team's life, from the owner's goals to the coach's day-to-day travails to the feeling of the sleet-soaked ball in the hands of a receiver on artificial turf. <br /><br /> The access John Feinstein enjoyed allows him to discuss with equal understanding the owner's management strategy, the coaches' and coordinators' plans for each new game, and how it all affects the players themselves.

Now he brings his considerable talents to the history of one of math's most enduring puzzles: the seemingly paradoxical nature of infinity. Is infinity a valid mathematical property or a meaningless abstraction? The nineteenth-century mathematical genius Georg Cantor's answer to this question not only surprised him but also shook the very foundations upon which math had been built. Cantor's counterintuitive discovery of a progression of larger and larger infinities created controversy in his time and may have hastened his mental breakdown, but it also helped lead to the development of set theory, analytic philosophy, and even computer technology. Smart, challenging, and thoroughly rewarding, Wallace's tour de force brings immediate and high-profile recognition to the bizarre and fascinating world of higher mathematics.",3.72,344,Unknown Binding, ,9,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75785.Everything_and_More,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75785.Everything_and_More

People die happily, viewing it in endless repetition. The novel <i>Infinite Jest</i> is the story of this addictive entertainment, and in particular how it affects a Boston halfway house for recovering addicts and a nearby tennis academy, whose students have many budding addictions of their own. As the novel unfolds, various individuals, organisations, and governments vie to obtain the master copy of Infinite Jest for their own ends, and the denizens of the tennis school and halfway house are caught up in increasingly desperate efforts to control the movie—as is a cast including burglars, transvestite muggers, scam artists, medical professionals, pro football stars, bookies, drug addicts both active and recovering, film students, political assassins, and one of the most endearingly messed-up families ever captured in a novel.<br /><br />On this outrageous frame hangs an exploration of essential questions about what entertainment is, and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment interacts with our need to connect with other humans; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. The huge cast and multilevel narrative serve a story that accelerates to a breathtaking, heartbreaking, unfogettable conclusion. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human and one of those rare books that renew the very idea of what a novel can do.",4.28,1079,Paperback, ,1064,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75786.Infinite_Jest,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75786.Infinite_Jest

This, he says, is ""all that matters,"" and his latest book aims to demystify buying principles for salespeople. From the red cloth cover to the small trim size to the amusing (but not cloying) cartoons on almost every page, this is an appealing and accessible book. The author is obviously enthusiastic, if not manic, about sales, and though some of his mantras verge on hokey, much of his prose is straightforward and realistic. Each chapter includes a mini table of contents, pull quotes and takeaway sound bites, examples of typical whines from salespeople (e.g., ""the client said they spent their whole budget"") paired with a positive response (e.g., ""Decision makers make the budget. Non-decision makers spend the budget""), and plenty of advice and ideas that can be taken in and studied as a whole or referred to at random for inspiration.

But, as Groucho might retort, his cover is at the dry-cleaner, and, besides, Groucho is not one to hide his light under any bushel (even one of stuffed clams). So he and Frank Denby, his sidekick, scriptwriter and close friend, set out to uphold their reputation as amateur sleuths by looking into the death of British director Eric Olmstead. First Olmstead fainted at a star-studded Halloween party after a man dressed as the Grim Reaper had whispered to him and then disappeared. But it is not until the next day that he is found dead -- presumably by his own hand. <br /><br />It is 1939; everyone expects the U.S. to join the war raging in Europe. And everyone is looking under the bed for spies. Soon the questions surrounding the death of Eric Olmstead takes on an odor of espionage. <br /><br />The police call Olmstead's death a suicide. After all, he did leave a (typed) note. His widow refuses to believe that her husband shot himself, and persuades Groucho and Frank to look further. Soon the pair is enmeshed in FBI agents and Los Angeles police, while the grieving widow clamors for revenge. Here is where Groucho proves his genius as a detective--he seizes on the clue that reveals the death to be murder. <br /><br />This, however, is only the beginning. There is another murder. Groucho and Frank are attacked; Frank is shot at (but not hit); Groucho is hit (but not shot at; just knocked to the floor by the fleeing assailant). They not only survive, but they pinpoint the Nazi spy and the Hollywood figures working with them. <br /><br />In a romp made delightful in spite of spies, murders, and occasional dire peril, Goulart uncannily resurrects the most garrulous Marx brother and his unique brand of patter. The Groucho Marx of these stories is the next best thing to the capering of the late comedian himself, and a happy gift to everyone who remembers him fondly as well as those meeting him for the first time. <br />",3.88,224,Hardcover, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76070.Groucho_Marx_Secret_Agent,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76070.Groucho_Marx_Secret_Agent

In a glass-enclosed city of absolute straight lines, ruled over by the all-powerful 'Benefactor', the citizens of the totalitarian society of OneState live out lives devoid of passion and creativity - until D-503, a mathematician who dreams in numbers, makes a discovery: he has an individual soul. Set in the twenty-sixth century AD, <i>We</i> is the classic dystopian novel and was the forerunner of works such as George Orwell's <i>1984</i> and Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i>. It was suppressed for many years in Russia and remains a resounding cry for individual freedom, yet is also a powerful, exciting and vivid work of science fiction. Clarence Brown's brilliant translation is based on the corrected text of the novel, first published in Russia in 1988 after more than sixty years' suppression.",3.92,255,Paperback, ,2895,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76171.We,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76171.We
