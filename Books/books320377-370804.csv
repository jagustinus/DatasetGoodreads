David Chandler, a world-renowned historian of Cambodia, examines the Khmer Rouge phenomenon by focusing on one of its key institutions, the secret prison outside Phnom Penh known by the code name ""S-21."" The facility was an interrogation center where more than 14,000 ""enemies"" were questioned, tortured, and made to confess to counterrevolutionary crimes. Fewer than a dozen prisoners left S-21 alive.<br />During the Democratic Kampuchea (DK) era, the existence of S-21 was known only to those inside it and a few high-ranking Khmer Rouge officials. When invading Vietnamese troops discovered the prison in 1979, murdered bodies lay strewn about and instruments of torture were still in place. An extensive archive containing photographs of victims, cadre notebooks, and DK publications was also found. Chandler utilizes evidence from the S-21 archive as well as materials that have surfaced elsewhere in Phnom Penh. He also interviews survivors of S-21 and former workers from the prison.<br />Documenting the violence and terror that took place within S-21 is only part of Chandler's story. Equally important is his attempt to understand what happened there in terms that might be useful to survivors, historians, and the rest of us. Chandler discusses the ""culture of obedience"" and its attendant dehumanization, citing parallels between the Khmer Rouge executions and the Moscow Show Trails of the 1930s, Nazi genocide, Indonesian massacres in 1965-66, the Argentine military's use of torture in the 1970s, and the recent mass killings in Bosnia and Rwanda. In each of these instances, Chandler shows how turning victims into ""others"" in a manner that was systematically devaluing and racialist made it easier to mistreat and kill them. More than a chronicle of Khmer Rouge barbarism, <i>Voices from S-21</i> is also a judicious examination of the psychological dimensions of state-sponsored terrorism that conditions human beings to commit acts of unspeakable brutality.",3.83,254,Paperback, ,3,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321084.Voices_From_S_21_Terror_And_History_In_Pol_Pot_s_Secret_Prison,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321084.Voices_From_S_21_Terror_And_History_In_Pol_Pot_s_Secret_Prison

Now available in English, this translation provides in striking and original language Fichte's exploration of the transcendental foundations of experience and knowing in ways that go beyond Kant and Reinhold and charts a promising, novel pathway for German Idealism. Through a close examination of this work one can see that Fichte's thought is much more than a way station between Kant and Hegel, thus making the case for Fichte's independent philosophical importance.<br /><br />The text is divided into two parts: a doctrine of truth or reason, and a doctrine of appearance. A central feature of the text is its performative dimension. Philosophy, for Fichte, is something we enact rather than any discursively expressible object of awareness; a philosophical truth is not expressible as a set of propositions but is a spontaneous inwardly occurring realization. Therefore, he always regards the expression of philosophy in words as strategic, aiming to ignite philosophy's essentially inward process and to arouse the event of philosophical insight.",3.69,324,Paperback, ,7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326870.Science_of_Knowledge,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/326870.Science_of_Knowledge

The Tour is home to rowdy, randy young men often drunk with money and fame; fueled by alcohol and adrenaline, they barnstorm from town to town like rock stars, with all the attendant excesses. And in each player's shadow is his faithful caddie -- performing a thankless six-figure job that comes with all the security of a handshake deal. The PGA Tour offers fabulous rewards, but its good life does not come without a price. In Bud, Sweat, and Tees, Alan Shipnuck takes a no-holds-barred look at modern professional golf. Rich Beem, the hero of our story, joined the Tour as the most clueless of rookies, a logo-free rube only a couple of years removed from the straight world, where he made seven dollars an hour hawking cell phones. Beem took his winnings from big-money matches all across the state of Texas and scraped together enough to go out on Tour, but as he would quickly find out, getting to the big leagues is only half the battle. The fun-loving Beem, more likely to pound beers than range balls, first struggled to fit in among the country-club brats who populate the pro golf scene, and then had to fight to survive the cutthroat competition and crushing self-doubt. Staying true to his girl back home would prove equally challenging.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Steve Duplantis, the one-time golden boy of the Tour's caddie ranks, was enduring his own tribulations. At the tender age of twenty-one Duplantis began packing for Jim Furyk, and together they reached the pinnacle of the golf world, from Ryder Cup dustups to near misses at the Masters. But like Beem, Duplantis has a taste for thewild life, which helps explain how he wound up as a single dad, trying to balance the demands of fatherhood with the siren song of the road -- a juggling act that eventually cost him his lucrative job on Furyk's bag. Fate brought Duplantis and Beem together, and in their first tournament, the Kemper Open, they pulled off one of the most improbable triumphs in golf history.<br /><br />What happens next, at this unlikely intersection of lives and careers? How does a lifelong underdog like Beem handle overnight fame and fortune? Would Duplantis make good on this second chance and turn his career, and maybe his life, around? And would Beem and Duplantis's partnership survive the course of a turbulent season chock full of enough misadventures to land them in a Scottish jail?<br /><br />""Bud, Sweat, and Tees"" is a sometimes bawdy, often hilarious, and always unpredictable account of a strange and magical year in the lives, on and off the course, of golfer and caddie. An exciting and often poignant story, it stands as the best insider's sports book since Jim Bouton's Ball Four, and marks Alan Shipnuck as a writer of extraordinary promise.",3.85,288,Hardcover, ,8,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327604.Bud_Sweat_Tees,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327604.Bud_Sweat_Tees

The book is organized around the most common types of plants found in Northwest gardens: evergreen and deciduous shrubs; bamboos and tea roses; rhododendrons, camellia and other tree-like shrubs; hedge plants like boxwood and heather; clematis, wisteria and all those vines; and detailed information on trees by species from dogwoods to weeping cherries. In her trademark witty style, Turnbull also addresses tools, landscape renovation, and design errors. Included too are her amusing Ten Commandments for gardeners, which feature such treasures as ""Thou shalt not weed-whip the trunk of thy tree, nor bash it with thine mower, nor leave anything tied on thy tree or the branches of thy tree, as is done in the land of the philistines.""",4.28,336,Paperback,Second Edition,7,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327689.Cass_Turnbull_s_Guide_to_Pruning,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327689.Cass_Turnbull_s_Guide_to_Pruning

It's the book your grandmother and mother probably learned to cook from, the book you gave your sister when she got married. This, the first revision in more than twenty years, is better than ever. Here's why: Every chapter has been rethought with an emphasis on freshness, convenience, and health.<br /><br />All the recipes have been reconceived and tested with an eye to modern taste, and the cooking knowledge imparted with each subject enriched to the point where everyone from a beginning to an experienced cook will feel completely supported.<br /><br />The new Joy continues the vision of American cooking that began with the first edition of Joy. It is still the book you can turn to for perfect Beef Wellington and Baked Macaroni and Cheese. It's also the book where you can now find Turkey on the Grill, Spicy Peanut Sesame Noodles, and vegetarian meals.<br /><br />The new Joy provides more thorough descriptions of ingredients, from the familiar to the most exotic. For instance, almost all the varieties of apples grown domestically are described-- the months they become available, how they taste, what they are best used for, and how long they keep. But for the first time Joy features a complete section on fresh and dried chili peppers: how to roast and grill them, how to store them, and how long they keep-- with illustrations of each pepper.<br /><br />An all-new ""RULES"" section in many chapters gives essential cooking basics at a glance: washing and storing salad greens, selecting a pasta and a matching sauce, determining when a piece of fish is cooked through, stuffing a chicken, and making a perfect souffle.<br /><br />New chapters reflect changing American tastes and lifestyles:<br /><br />Separate new chapters on grains, beans, and pasta include recipes for grits, polenta, pilafs, risottos, vegetarian chills, bean casseroles, and make-ahead lasagnes.<br /><br />New baking and dessert chapters promise to enhance Joy of Cooking's reputation as a bible for bakers. Quick and yeast bread recipes range from focaccia, pizza, and sourdoughs to muffins and coffee cakes. Separate chapters cover custards and puddings, pies and tarts, cookies, cakes, cobblers, and other American fruit desserts revived for this edition. Recipes include one-bowl cakes, gingerbread, angel and sponge cakes, meringues, pound cakes, fruitcakes, 6 different kinds of cheesecake-- there's even an illustrated wedding cake recipe, which takes you through all the stages from building a stand, making and decorating the cake, to transporting it to the reception without a hitch.<br /><br />Little Dishes showcases foods from around the world: hummus, baba ghanoush, bruschetta, tacos, empanadas, and fried wontons.<br /><br />AII new drawings of techniques, ingredients, and equipment, integrated throughout an elegant new design, and over 300 more pages round out the new Joy.<br /><br />Among this book's other unique features: microwave instructions for preparing beans, grains, and vegetables; dozens of new recipes for people who are lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten; expanded ingredients chart now features calories, essential vitamins, and levels of fats and cholesterol. There are ideas for substitutions to lower fat in recipes and reduced-fat recipes in the baking sections.<br /><br />From cover to cover, Joy's chapters have been imbued with the knowledge and passion of America's greatest cooks and cooking teachers.

A judicious and revealing look at all twenty evolutionary accounts of the trait of human female orgasm, Lloyd's book is at the same time a case study of how certain biases steer science astray.<br /><br />Over the past fifteen years, the effect of sexist or male-centered approaches to science has been hotly debated. Drawing especially on data from nonhuman primates and human sexology over eighty years, Lloyd shows what damage such bias does in the study of female orgasm. She also exposes a second pernicious form of bias that permeates the literature on female orgasms: a bias toward adaptationism. Here Lloyd's critique comes alive, demonstrating how most of the evolutionary accounts either are in conflict with, or lack, certain types of evidence necessary to make their cases--how they simply assume that female orgasm must exist because it helped females in the past reproduce. As she weighs the evidence, Lloyd takes on nearly everyone who has written on the subject: evolutionists, animal behaviorists, and feminists alike. Her clearly and cogently written book is at once a convincing case study of bias in science and a sweeping summary and analysis of what is known about the evolution of the intriguing trait of female orgasm.",3.95,311,Paperback, ,11,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328475.Case_of_the_Female_Orgasm,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328475.Case_of_the_Female_Orgasm

The Principles of Sociology was a later work in Spencer's grand scheme, with the first installments appearing in 1874 and continuing until 1896. The re-issue of the complete volumes of this great work will stimulate renewed interest in Spencer's sociology, not just as an historical curiosity, but as a body of work that can still inform sociology. Indeed, at a time when it seems sociology has mined its classics for all the gold they contain, Spencer's work provides a ""mother lode"" of new treasures. Sociologists and others will be surprised at the profound insights they will find in The Principles of Sociology.<br /><br />This complete three volume set of The Principles is divided into eight ""Parts."" Part I sets up the approach for the rest of the volumes. Here, Spencer distinguishes the inorganic, organic, and superorganic realms of the universe, with the most important comparison being the differences between the organic and superorganic. The most well-known sections appear in Part II on ""The Introductions of Sociology"" where the similarities and differences between superorganic and organic bodies are introduced. However, there is much more to Part II because here the basic theory is developed, which still informs contemporary sociology. Approximately two thirds of The Principles of Sociology is dedicated to analysis of human institutional systems. In these pages, which comprise Parts III-VIII of The Principles, Spencer mobilizes even more data to develop specific principles about the operation of institutional systems.<br /><br />The Principles of Sociology is filled with insights and still worthwhile principles on the dynamics of human organization. Portrayals of Spencer as a naive functionalist and advocate of laissez-faire are inaccurate and unfair, as these volumes demonstrate. Spencer presents us with a set of principles about the operation of human societies. This book will be essential to sociologists, and others professionally interested in social science theory and the history of ideas.",4.33,2240,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328693.The_Principles_of_Sociology,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328693.The_Principles_of_Sociology

Now Iggulden returns to the story of Julius Caesar and a realm that stretches from the sands of North Africa to the coast of Britain. Against this magnificent backdrop, Caesar, his first victories under his belt and a series of key alliances in place, makes his move toward power and glory–and commands his famous legions on one of history’s bloodiest and most daring military campaigns.<br /><br /> It is the heart of the first century B.C. For Julius Caesar, the time has come to enter the treacherous political battleground that has become Rome. Having proved his valor in the slaves’ revolt, Caesar is strengthened by the love and vision of a beautiful older woman, and by the sword of his loyal friend, Marcus Brutus. And when he is appointed to a new position of power, Caesar manages to do what none of the other great figures of his time could: capture the hearts of the Roman people themselves. Crushing a rebellion, bringing order to the teeming city, Caesar then makes the move that will change history. He leaves Rome for the foothills of the Alps. And with an army made in his own image, he begins a daring charge through Gaul, across the English Channel, and to the wilds of tribal Britain.<br /><br /> Here, in a series of cataclysmic clashes, the legend of Julius Caesar will be forged. And while Caesar and Brutus pit their lives–and those of their men–against the armies of the wilderness, their political adversaries in Rome grow at once more fearful and more formidable. So when the fighting at the dominion’s edge is over, the greatest danger to Julius Caesar will await him on the Tiber–with a man who wants Rome himself.<br /><br /> From the clash of armies to the heat of a woman’s seduction, from the thunder of battle to the orgies of pleasure and plunder that follow in a warrior’s wake,<b> Emperor: The Field of Swords</b> captures in riveting detail a world being shaped by a brilliant civilization. And in this extraordinary novel, the fate of Rome is being driven by the ambitions of a single man.

Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar. <br />On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family-and his adoptive brother-will be the most powerful force in his life. <br />As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat-under the tutelage of one of Rome's most fearsome gladiators-Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier's proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win. <br />The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict-a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. <br />Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts-from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.

The twentieth century—a time of unprecedented progress—has produced a tremendous strain on the very elements that comprise life itself: This raises the key question of the twenty-first century: How much longer can this go on? With wit and erudition, Ronald Wright lays out a-convincing case that history has always provided an answer, whether we care to notice or not. From Neanderthal man to the Sumerians to the Roman Empire, A Short History of Progress dissects the cyclical nature of humanity's development and demise, the 10,000-year old experiment that we've unleashed but have yet to control. It is Wright's contention that only by understanding and ultimately breaking from the patterns of progress and disaster that humanity has repeated around the world since the Stone Age can we avoid the onset of a new Dark Age. Wright illustrates how various cultures throughout history have literally manufactured their own end by producing an overabundance of innovation and stripping bare the very elements that allowed them to initially advance. Wright's book is brilliant; a fascinating rumination on the hubris at the heart of human development and the pitfalls we still may have time to avoid.",4.11,224,Paperback, ,347,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331227.A_Short_History_of_Progress,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331227.A_Short_History_of_Progress

</i>The Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Maus</i> tells the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Jewish survivor of Hitler’s Europe, and his son, a cartoonist coming to terms with his father’s story. <i>Maus</i> approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (<i>The New York Times</i>).<br /><br /><i>Maus </i>is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. <i>Maus </i>studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.",4.54,296,Hardcover, ,408,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331692.The_Complete_Maus,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331692.The_Complete_Maus

She’s tryin’ her best<br />To make him feel better, <br />Wants to polish his crown jewels, <br />But he won’t let her. <br />""Stead of sayin’ yea, the fool says nay, <br />And the whole court’s figurin’ he must be gay.<br /><br />Well, then in come Hamlet’s oldest friends, <br />Rosenstern and Guildencrantz, <br />They say, ""Hey there, Ham, you gloomy Gus, <br />Get up – get down – and party with us. <br />We brought you some actores, <br />Some tunes and some lyrics<br />To put on a play to boost up your spirits."" <br />Hamlet says, ""Hey – songs and skits, <br />That gives me an idea that could stir up some shit. <br />We’ll put on a play –<br />""N"" that could be just the thing<br />To catch the conscience of the king, <br />If there is a conscience in the motherfuckin’ king.""<br /><br />So Hamlet calls all the actors, he say, ""’Fore this drama starts, <br />I’m gonna tell you suckers how to play your parts. <br />You gotta speak the speech like I pronounced it –<br />Don’t rush it, don’t milk it, don’t drag it, don’t bounce it. <br />I mean, do it trippingly on the tongue, <br />Or else I’ll see your thespian asses strung up and hung. <br />And don’t saw the air with your hands flappin’ wild, <br />""N’ don’t go mouthin’ my words in some method style.""<br /><br />Then the lead actor says, ""Hey – are we alive?<br />Or just some talking meat that’s gotta listen to this jive?<br />I have read this thing you call a script<br />And it ain’t too bad, it’s got a few little dips. <br />But with some new dialogue and a few minor edits –<br />Hey, do you mind sharing writer credits? <br />But this part about the king? -- poisoning his brother? <br />I play this wile the real king’s watchin’? Sittin’ with your mother? <br />You must be out of your cotton-pickin’ mind. <br />He’ll cut out my tongue, he’ll gouge out my eyes, <br />He’ll boil me in oil and send me to hell."" <br />Hamlet says, ""How about double scale?"" – The actor says, ""Well…<br /><br />""I want my name above the title, three percent of the gross, <br />I want that tall brunette as my dialogue coach. <br />I want approval of director and a juicy per diem, <br />And if there’s changes in the script, I got to see ‘em. <br />I want a dresser, and undresser and a hairdresser, too, <br />And I gotta-gotta-gotta have the biggest dressing room. <br />I want an escape clause that lets me out in a month, <br />And the first thing I insist is that you fire that cunt. <br />I want transportation to and from every show, <br />I want complimentary tickets for everybody I know. <br />I want my brother and my cousin hired to play in the band, <br />And don’t go tryin’ to sneak in any extra matinees. <br />And next time you wanna speak to me, <br />Check with the director first. <br />Now will you please go away and let us rehearse?"" <br />So Hamlet slinks off, lookin’ for a backer, <br />Mutterin’ how he’ll never ever talk to another fuckin’ actor. <br />And him and Horatio, they walk down a ways, <br />Till they see some clown diggin’ a mouldy grave. <br />Hamlet picks up a skull, he says, ""Who was this sucker?"" <br />They say, ""Yorick."" He says, ""Yorick? I knew the motherfucker. <br />He used to be court jester. Hey, Yorick, show us how<br />You used to make them funny faces – Why ain’t you laughin’ now? <br />I’ve kissed these lips, I know not how oft."" And Horatio quips, <br />""Hey, let’s not announce how oft you kissed them lips. <br />I mean people already talkin’ ‘bout the way you walk, <br />And the fact that you ain’t givin’ Ophelia no nook.""<br /><br />Oh, and speakin’ of Ophelia – Polonius, her daddy, <br />Says, ""Hey, that prince is drivin’ my little girl batty. <br />Got her runnin’ all night and sleepin’ till noon, <br />God knows what else he got her doin’. <br />But he’s our royal prince, lord of earth, sky and water, <br />But he’s also a horny little pimply-faced shithead<br />Trying to hump my daughter."" <br />So Polonius calls Ophelia and says, ""Listen, darlin’ daughter, <br />I hope you and Ham ain’t doin’ things you shouldn’t oughter, <br />‘Cause you let ‘em touch an ankle and they wanna grab a knee, <br />And they never buy nothin’ that you let ‘em have for free.""<br /><br />Ophelia says, ""Hey, Pop, I know the score, <br />You think I wanna wind up another palace whore? <br />I got the dud sendin’ me letters and babblin’ ‘bout the moon, <br />I really do think his bells are out of tune."" <br />""Well, don’t you go dingin’ his bells,"" says Polonius, <br />""’’Cause if he throws you in the grass, <br />I’ll get your big brother Laertes to kick his royal ass.""<br /><br />Now Laertes overhears his name bein’ bandied about, <br />He says, ""Hey, Pop, you signin’ my ass up for somethin’<br />My head don’t know about?"" <br />Plonius says, ""Son, it’s Hamlet, that loony tune, <br />Been fed all his life with a silver spoon. <br />He’s in my face and on my neck, <br />I mean the dude ain’t playin’ with a full damn deck. <br />He’s bumblin’ around twirlin’ his crown, <br />And callin’ me a fishmonger all over town. <br />And he’s charmed your baby sister with his rhymes and his riddles. <br />Hey, you think she’s puttin’ on a little weight around the middle?"" <br />Laertes says, ""Hey, Pop, she ain’t no baby, <br />She got a set of jugs tha’d drive any prince crazy. <br />Now that’s just a natural fact and not lust or incest, <br />And if she shakes ‘em right, she could be a princess."" <br />""That’s right,"" says Ophelia. ""That’s my scheme, <br />And the way kings been dyin’ ‘round here, I could wind up queen."" <br />""Enough,"" says Polonius. ""That Pince has ruined my day. <br />Now we gotta see his fuckin’ play within a play. <br />Hell, the place’ll be drafty, the seats won’t be com’fa’ble, <br />I wouldn’t go at all but these tickets ain’t refundable. <br />Prob’ly full of symbolism, I won’t understand it, <br />Shit, I hope it rains and all the critics pan it.""<br /><br />So they go to the play and everybody’s there. <br />They got diamonds on their doublets, <br />They got ribbons in their hair. <br />Lords, ladies, dogs, babies, all in attendance, <br />The marquee says MURDER, DECEIT AND VENGEANCE. <br />ONE OF YEAR’S TEN BEST. DO NOT MISS IT.<br />So everybody figures it’s another piece of shit. <br />And they’re bitchin’ ‘bout their seats, buckin’ the line, <br />Scalpin’ tickets and sippin’ wine, <br />Rattlin’ their programs, twistin’ in their chairs, <br />Tryin’ to catch if any celebrities are there. <br />Then the play begins – and ooh, looky here –<br />It shows the king puttin’ poison in his brother’s ear. <br />And King Claudius is watchin’, and -- ooh -- is he pissed. <br />He says, ""I know who’s responsible for this."" <br />He calls, ""Hey Gertie, come here, hon. <br />What the hell’s the matter with your jive-ass son? <br />I give the kid room, board ‘n’ remedial education, <br />And he calls me a murderer, and other wild accusations. <br />Hell, I’d sue him for libel for implyin’ that shit. <br />But the libel laws ain’t been invented yet. <br />Just ‘cause I’m bangin’ you, he’s givin’ me hell, <br />I think he wants to hump you his own damn self.""<br /><br />Queen Gertrude says, ""I think he’s goin’ through<br />An Oedipal rejection, seein’ his uncle<br />Replace his father in his momma’s affection."" <br />""Oedipal?"" says the king. ""The punk is givin’ me some shit.<br />I’ll send him where I sent his pop if he don’t quit.<br />So you tell him it’s better to leave some things unsaid,<br />Or he’ll be puttin’ on his crown without his motherfuckin’ head."" <br />So the queen runs to Hamlet, she says, ""Oh listen, son, <br />Y’better suck up to the king before some foul deed gets done.<br />It’s true he wears black socks and Hawaiian shirts,<br />But that ain’t no reason to treat him like dirt,<br />Because he is your uncle, and I do wear his ring,<br />And most of all, he is the motherfuckin’ king."" <br />""Don’t say mother-fuckin’ king,"" says Hamlet. ""Please, <br />Somehow that phrase makes my blood freeze. <br />My daddy was a handsome dude with dignity and class, <br />And this fat fool got hair on his back and boils on his ass. <br />Can anybody get you in their goddamn bed<br />Just ‘cause they got a crown on their goddamned head?"" <br />His momma says, ""Hey, before you go off the deep end, <br />There’s some things about women you gotta comprehend.<br /><br />""Now milkmaids and queens, we all have filet mignon dreams, <br />But when the steak is gone, you will eat the beans. <br />And when you’re out of beans, you’ll chew the shoes off their feet, <br />But you eat. <br />Just picture me – a sweet young thing, <br />Then boom – my husband’s dead – and this sucker’s king. <br />So it’s ‘heat the meat and act real sweet’<br />Or wind up with my ass out in the goddamned street. <br />I got cellulite, I got varicose veins, <br />I got a hip gets stiff every time it rains. <br />And -- this -- is what nursing a baby can do, <br />""Course, honey, I’m not blamin’ you, <br />Though you were such a hungry child, <br />But life goes on and a queen must smile.""<br /><br />Then hark – just then Hamlet hears a sound<br />From behind the curtain – like a mouse skitt’rin’ ‘round.<br />But it’s really Ophelia’s daddy, spyin’ for the king,<br />Listenin’ and takin’ down everything.<br />Hamlet yells, ""A rat!"" and he stabs at the place,<br />And kerplunk, out falls Polonius on his eavedroppin’ face.<br />Hamlet sees it ain’t the king, he says, ""Oh shit,<br />Y’finally do take action and this is what you get.<br />Now I killed my girlfriend’s poppa and I’m covered with his blood,<br />How do you explain this to someone you love?""<br /><br />Then here comes Ophelia, callin’, ""Daddy, Daddy dear,<br />Hamlet, is my daddy in here?"" <br />Well…he is… and he ain’t – but someone should have told the cat<br />Y’don’t wanna get stabbed, don’t make noise like a rat.<br />She cries, ""Oh, my daddy’s dead and I can see <br />You stuck it in him like you stuck it in me. <br />I can’t believe the shit you done to me. <br />You used to want all – now you want none of me. <br />Is this your perverted way of makin’ fun o’ me?"" <br />Hamlet says, ""Hey then, get thee someplace…<br />Maybe a … a nunnery."" <br />""Get me to a nunnery?"" Ophelia moans, <br />""Now that you ate the chicken, you wanna try and hide the bones? <br />With your poetry and promises you messed up my brain, <br />You are a dirty dog – and not a great Dane."" <br />""Please,"" says Hamlet, ""I’m in a crazed condition. <br />Can’t you see I’m torn by indecision? <br />To be or not to be? That’s the fuckin’ question<br />That’s givin’ me migraines and indigestion. <br />Should I take arms against a sea of trouble, <br />Or just walk around goin’ gubble-gubble-gubble?""<br /><br />Ophelia says, ""Hey, you don’t fool me a bit,<br />You’re fakin’ all this psycho shit, <br />‘Cause if you’re insane you don’t have to kill the king, <br />Or marry me or do any damn thing."" <br />Ham says, ""Hey, go bake a cake, or give your booty a shake,<br />Or take a jump in the motherfuckin’ lake –""<br />Well, that’s where he made another fatal mistake. <br />Y’see he didn’t really mean for the bitch to do it, <br />But she’s gone like a flash, and run, jump, splash, <br />She’s floatin’ and bloatin’ ‘fore anybody knew it.<br />""Oh, when it rains it pours,"" says Hamlet, ""Ain’t no doubt, <br />Here’s another thing I gotta feel guilty about.""<br /><br />Well, they have Ophelia’s funeral and everybody’s there.<br />They got diamonds on their doublet, they got ribbons in their hair. <br />They’re rattlin’ their beads and twistin’ in their chairs, <br />Tryin’ to catch if any celebrities are there. <br />And it’s a pleasant event, until into her grave<br />Leaps her brother Laertes and he rants and raves. <br />He’s shakin’ his fist and pullin’ his hair, <br />Gettin’ his ass tangled up in his underwear, <br />Jumpin’ up and down in a frenzied fit, <br />Meanwhile stompin’ her body to shit. <br />He cries, ""FEE-FO-FI, if I find the guy who caused her to die, <br />I’ll slice him like a pie. I’ll cut out his heart and send it to Peru, <br />‘N’ I’ll c.o.d. his balls off to Timbuktu, <br />Ship his dick to England in a registered letter, <br />And then let him try to get his shit back together."" <br />Then the king pulls his coat, he says, ""Harken to this, <br />Hamlet’s the dude who fucked up your sis. <br />And he also stabbed your daddy, too, <br />And all you do is boo-hoo-hoo? What kind of brother and son are you?<br />If it was my family I know what I’d do, I’d be on him like a damned tattoo. <br />Now… there is a sword with a poisoned tip. <br />It’ll send any sucker on a one-way trip, <br />‘Cause all it takes is one itty bitty scratch…<br />Hey, Hamlet, how about a little fencin’ match?""<br />Well, then the whole fuckin’ place caves in, <br />Hamlet stabs Laertes and Laertes stabs him. <br />Then Hamlet turns around and stabs his uncle, too, <br />While the queen drinks some poison the king had brewed. <br />So she dies, he dies, Hamlet dies, Laertes dies<br />On top of where Ophelia lies, <br />Right next to where Polonius died. <br />And before you can wink, blink or turn your head, <br />Chop-stab-slice -- every motherfucker’s dead.<br /><br />Then in walks this cat Fortinbras, he says, ""What – is -- this?<br />I have never seen such a fuckin’ mess. <br />You got skulls and swords, you got guts and gore, <br />You got bodies piled up from ceiling to floor. <br />You got broken glass, y’got tangled hairs, <br />You got blood and wine runnin’ down the stairs. <br />You got dented armor and ripped up gowns, <br />You got bent-up crowns just rollin’ ‘round. <br />Y’got a punctured king, y’got a poisoned queen, <br />Y’got a sweet prince dyin’ on the mezzanine. <br />And behind that curtain there’s another dead duff, <br />And a body from the fishpond just floated up. <br />Y’got a stiff in the garden with some gunk in his ear, <br />And a tatto says GERTRUDE FOREVER right here, <br />And two guards on the gate tower drunk on beer. <br />What the hell’s been goin’ on here?""<br /><br />Well, that was the end of our sweet prince, <br />He died in confusion and nobody’s seen him since. <br />And the moral of the story is bells do get out of tune…<br />And you can find shit in a silver spoon…<br />And an old man’s revenge can be a young man’s ruin…<br />Oh – and never look too close… at what your mamma is doin'.",3.71,18,Unknown Binding, ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332100.Hamlet_as_Told_on_the_Street,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332100.Hamlet_as_Told_on_the_Street

Now, twenty-five years later, the University of Notre Dame Press is pleased to release the third edition of After Virtue, which includes a new prologue “After Virtue after a Quarter of a Century.”<br /> <br />In this classic work, Alasdair MacIntyre examines the historical and conceptual roots of the idea of virtue, diagnoses the reasons for its absence in personal and public life, and offers a tentative proposal for its recovery. While the individual chapters are wide-ranging, once pieced together they comprise a penetrating and focused argument about the price of modernity. In the Third Edition prologue, MacIntyre revisits the central theses of the book and concludes that although he has learned a great deal and has supplemented and refined his theses and arguments in other works, he has “as yet found no reason for abandoning the major contentions” of this book.

Now, twenty-five years later, the University of Notre Dame Press is pleased to release the third edition of <i>After Virtue</i>, which includes a new prologue “<i>After Virtue</i> after a Quarter of a Century.”<br /> <br />In this classic work, Alasdair MacIntyre examines the historical and conceptual roots of the idea of virtue, diagnoses the reasons for its absence in personal and public life, and offers a tentative proposal for its recovery. While the individual chapters are wide-ranging, once pieced together they comprise a penetrating and focused argument about the price of modernity. In the Third Edition prologue, MacIntyre revisits the central theses of the book and concludes that although he has learned a great deal and has supplemented and refined his theses and arguments in other works, he has “as yet found no reason for abandoning the major contentions” of this book.

On a foggy beach. In the seconds when Abby Mason—photographer, fiancée soon-to-be-stepmother—looks into her camera and commits her greatest error. Heartbreaking, uplifting, and beautifully told, here is the riveting tale of a family torn apart, of the search for the truth behind a child’s disappearance, and of one woman’s unwavering faith in the redemptive power of love—all made startlingly fresh through Michelle Richmond’s incandescent sensitivity and extraordinary insight.<br /><br />Six-year-old Emma vanished into the thick San Francisco fog. Or into the heaving Pacific. Or somewhere just beyond: to a parking lot, a stranger’s van, or a road with traffic flashing by. Devastated by guilt, haunted by her fears about becoming a stepmother, Abby refuses to believe that Emma is dead. And so she searches for clues about what happened that morning—and cannot stop the flood of memories reaching from her own childhood to illuminate that irreversible moment on the beach.<br /><br />Now, as the days drag into weeks, as the police lose interest and fliers fade on telephone poles, Emma’s father finds solace in religion and scientific probability—but Abby can only wander the beaches and city streets, attempting to recover the past and the little girl she lost. With her life at a crossroads, she will leave San Francisco for a country thousands of miles away. And there, by the side of another sea, on a journey that has led her to another man and into a strange subculture of wanderers and surfers, Abby will make the most astounding discovery of all—as the truth of Emma’s disappearance unravels with stunning force.<br /><br />A profoundly original novel of family, loss, and hope—of the choices we make and the choices made for us—<b>The Year of Fog</b> beguiles with the mysteries of time and memory even as it lays bare the deep and wondrous workings of the human heart.

Banks were closing everywhere. Millions of people lost everything. The Great Depression had caused a national breakdown. With the craft of a master storyteller, Jonathan Alter brings us closer than ever before to the Roosevelt magic. Facing the gravest crisis since the Civil War, FDR used his cagey political instincts and ebullient temperament in the storied first Hundred Days of his presidency to pull off an astonishing conjuring act that lifted the country and saved both democracy and capitalism.<br /><br />Who was this man? To revive the nation when it felt so hopeless took an extraordinary display of optimism and self-confidence. Alter shows us how a snobbish and apparently lightweight young aristocrat was forged into an incandescent leader by his domineering mother; his independent wife; his eccentric top adviser, Louis Howe; and his ally-turned-bitter-rival, Al Smith, the Tammany Hall street fighter FDR had to vanquish to complete his preparation for the presidency.<br /><br />""Old Doc Roosevelt"" had learned at Warm Springs, Georgia, how to lift others who suffered from polio, even if he could not cure their paralysis, or his own. He brought the same talents to a larger stage. Derided as weak and unprincipled by pundits, Governor Roosevelt was barely nominated for president in 1932. As president-elect, he escaped assassination in Miami by inches, then stiffed President Herbert Hoover's efforts to pull him into cooperating with him to deal with a terrifying crisis. In the most tumultuous and dramatic presidential transition in history, the entire banking structure came tumbling down just hours before FDR's legendary ""only thing we have to fear is fear itself"" Inaugural Address.<br /><br />In a major historical find, Alter unearths the draft of a radio speech in which Roosevelt considered enlisting a private army of American Legion veterans on his first day in office. He did not. Instead of circumventing Congress and becoming the dictator so many thought they needed, FDR used his stunning debut to experiment. He rescued banks, put men to work immediately, and revolutionized mass communications with pioneering press conferences and the first Fireside Chat. As he moved both right and left, Roosevelt's insistence on ""action now"" did little to cure the Depression, but he began to rewrite the nation's social contract and lay the groundwork for his most ambitious achievements, including Social Security.<br /><br />From one of America's most respected journalists, rich in insights and with fresh documentation and colorful detail, this thrilling story of presidential leadership--of what government is for--resonates through the events of today. It deepens our understanding of how Franklin Delano Roosevelt restored hope and transformed America.<br /><br /><i>The Defining Moment</i> will take its place among our most compelling works of political history.",3.93,414,Paperback, ,196,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332978.The_Defining_Moment,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/332978.The_Defining_Moment

Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a ""nice deserted moor."" As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes ""squealing the names of the players"" as well as ""tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves."" Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: ""The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field.""</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

Nikita Khrushchev was one of the most complex and important political figures of the twentieth century.

His life and career mirror the Soviet experience: revolution, civil war, famine, collectivization, industrialization, terror, world war, cold war, Stalinism, post-Stalinism. Complicit in terrible Stalinist crimes, Khrushchev nevertheless retained his humanity: his daring attempt to reform communism prepared the ground for its eventual collapse; and his awkward efforts to ease the cold war triggered its most dangerous crises.<br /><br /><br />This is the first comprehensive biography of Khrushchev and the first of any Soviet leader to reflect the full range of sources that have become available since the USSR collapsed.

Starting with its energized, work-obsessed royal families, the Dukes and the Reynoldses, and their embattled successors like the eccentric autocrat George Washington Hill and the feisty Joseph F. Cullman, the book vividly portrays the cigarrettemakers generations of entrepreneurial geniuses. Their problematic achievement was based on cunning business strategies and marketing dazzle, deft political power plays, and a relentless, often devious attack on antismoking forces in science, public health, and government. Enabling the whole process to unfold was the weirdly symbiotic relationship of an industry geared at any cost to sell, sell, sell cigarettes, and an American public habituated to ignore all health warnings and buy, buy, buy.<br /><br />At the center of this epic is the continuing drama of the Philip Morris Company and the crafty men at its helm. The youngest, once smallest entry in the business, it remained an underdog until the marketing brainstorm that transformed the Marlboro brand from little more than a woman’s fashion accessory to the ultimate emblem of hairy-chested machismo (and made it America’s – and the world’s – #1 smoke). Remarkably, the company’s global prosperity mounted steadily even as the news about cigarettes and health grew more dire by the year.<br /><br />Caught up in the Philip Morris story is the whole sweep of America’s cigarette history, from the glory days of rampant hucksterism – when smokers would “walk a mile for a Camel,” Winston tasted “good like a cigarette should,” and most of the nation could decipher “L.S. / M.F.T” – to the bombshell 1964 Surgeon General’s Report that definitively indicted smoking as a killer, to the age of the massive mergers that spawned RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris-Kraft General Foods.<br /><br />Here we learn how the leaf that was the New World’s most passionately devoured gift to the Old grew into humankind’s most dangerous consumer product, employing a vast rural corps of laborers, fattening tax revenues, and propagating a ring of fiercely competitive corporate superpowers; how tobacco’s peerless public-relations spinners applied their techniques to becloud the overwhelming evidence of the cigarette’s lethal and addictive nature; and finally, how the besieged industry and the aroused public-health forces nationwide collided over whether to outlaw the butt habit altogether or bring it into ever more withering social disdain and under ever tighter government control.",3.91,832,Paperback, ,26,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335451.Ashes_to_Ashes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335451.Ashes_to_Ashes

A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments, and fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters.",4.11,214,Hardcover, ,262,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/336903.The_Notebook,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/336903.The_Notebook

The only way to avoid further devastation, he argues, is a 90% cut in CO2 emissions in the rich nations of the world by 2030. In other words, our response will have to be immediate, and it will have to be decisive.<br /><br /> In every case he supports his proposals with a rigorous investigation into what works, what doesn’t, how much it costs, and what the problems might be. He wages war on bad ideas as energetically as he promotes good ones. And he is not afraid to attack anyone—friend or foe—whose claims are false or whose figures have been fudged.<br />After all, there is no time to waste.

The story of these remarkable sisters — and their central role in shaping the thinking of their day — has never before been fully told. Twenty years in the making, Megan Marshall's monumental biograpy brings the era of creative ferment known as American Romanticism to new life. Elizabeth, the oldest sister, was a mind-on-fire thinker. A powerful influence on the great writers of the era — Emerson, Hawthorne, and Thoreau among them — she also published some of their earliest works. It was Elizabeth who prodded these newly minted Transcendentalists away from Emerson's individualism and toward a greater connection to others. Mary was a determined and passionate reformer who finally found her soul mate in the great educator Horace Mann. The frail Sophia was a painter who won the admiration of the preeminent society artists of the day. She married Nathaniel Hawthorne — but not before Hawthorne threw the delicate dynamics among the sisters into disarray. Marshall focuses on the moment when the Peabody sisters made their indelible mark on history. Her unprecedented research into these lives uncovered thousands of letters never read before as well as other previously unmined original sources. The Peabody Sisters casts new light on a legendary American era. Its publication is destined to become an event in American biography. This book is highly recommended for students and reading groups interested in American history, American literature, and women's studies. It is a wonderful look into 19th-century life.",4.12,624,Paperback, ,159,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341894.The_Peabody_Sisters,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341894.The_Peabody_Sisters

She leaves her animated, affectionate family in South Bend, Indiana, at least in part because of the boarding school’s glossy brochure, in which boys in sweaters chat in front of old brick buildings, girls in kilts hold lacrosse sticks on pristinely mown athletic fields, and everyone sings hymns in chapel. <br /><br />As Lee soon learns, Ault is a cloistered world of jaded, attractive teenagers who spend summers on Nantucket and speak in their own clever shorthand. Both intimidated and fascinated by her classmates, Lee becomes a shrewd observer of–and, ultimately, a participant in–their rituals and mores. As a scholarship student, she constantly feels like an outsider and is both drawn to and repelled by other loners. By the time she’s a senior, Lee has created a hard-won place for herself at Ault. But when her behavior takes a self-destructive and highly public turn, her carefully crafted identity within the community is shattered.<br /><br />Ultimately, Lee’s experiences–complicated relationships with teachers; intense friendships with other girls; an all-consuming preoccupation with a classmate who is less than a boyfriend and more than a crush; conflicts with her parents, from whom Lee feels increasingly distant, coalesce into a singular portrait of the painful and thrilling adolescence universal to us all.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.39,406,Hardcover, ,101,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/342081.Prep,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/342081.Prep

He then turned his life effort into this simple, slender book – a volume that he vowed could replace libraries of philosophy, spirituality, and self-help for the purpose of attaining one definite goal: a life of prosperity.

He saw the mountains and deserts of Bolivia, the Inca remains at Machu Picchu and Cuzco, the forests of Guatemala; he sailed up the Pacific coast from Ecuador to Panama and met his first wife in Honduras.

Here is an account of our planetary ascent into higher consciousness, a big-screen view of the Earth drama through the experience of the Ascended Masters, Thoth, Babiji, and a playful witness-guide from the 13th dimension, Drunvalo Melchizedek. Drunvalo journeyed through the great abyss to polarity consciousness as a catalyst to help us wake up. It took him long time to get here, so he plans to stay for awhile. His view of what's really going on is mind-blowing yet somehow strangely familiar, touching chords of deep memory and intuition concerning our future. Perhaps you're among those who have always felt that we are headed somewhere. But you may not know that the speed at which we're now evolving is unheard of in the universe, thanks to a wildly successful interplanetary experiment done in 1972. These adventures in other-dimensional reality are coming to fruition right here on Earth, right now!

Soon Jacques is caught up in the hurly-burly action of his mother's café, where he proves a natural. He endures a literal trial by fire and works his way up the ladder in the feudal system of France's most famous restaurant, finally becoming Charles de Gaulle's personal chef, watching the world being refashioned from the other side of the kitchen door.<br /><br />When he comes to America, Jacques immediately falls in with a small group of as-yet-unknown food lovers, including Craig Claiborne, James Beard, and Julia Child, whose adventures redefine American food. Through it all, Jacques proves himself to be a master of the American art of reinvention: earning a graduate degree from Columbia University, turning down a job as John F. Kennedy's chef to work at Howard Johnson's, and, after a near-fatal car accident, switching careers once again to become a charismatic leader in the revolution that changed the way Americans approached food. Included as well are approximately forty all-time favorite recipes created during the course of a career spanning nearly half a century, from his mother's utterly simple cheese soufflé to his wife's pork ribs and red beans.<br /><br /><i>The Apprentice</i> is the poignant and sometimes funny tale of a boy's coming of age.

Born in Berlin in 1771 as the daughter of a Jewish merchant, Rahel Varnhagen would come to host one of the most prominent salons of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Arendt discovered her writings some time in the mid-1920s, and soon began to reimagine Rahel's inner life and write her biography. Long unavailable and never before published as Arendt intended, Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess returns to print in an extraordinary new edition.<br /><br />Arendt draws a lively and complex portrait of a woman during the period of the Napoleonic wars and the early emancipation of the Jews, a figure who met and corresponded with some of the most celebrated authors, artists, and politicians of her time. She documents Rahel's attempts to earn legitimacy as a writer and gain access to the highest aristocratic circles, to assert for herself a position in German culture in spite of her gender and religion.<br /><br />Arendt had almost completed a first draft of her book on Rahel by 1933 when she was forced into exile by the National Socialists. She continued her work on the manuscript in Paris and New York, but would not publish the book until 1958. Rahel Varnhagen became not just a study of a historical Jewish figure, but a poignant reflection on Arendt's own life and times, her first exploration of German-Jewish identity and the possibility of Jewish life in the face of unimaginable adversity.<br /><br />For this first complete critical edition of the book in any language, Liliane Weissberg reconstructs the notes Arendt planned for Rahel Varnhagen but never fully executed. She reveals the extent to which Arendt wove the biography largely from the words of Rahel and her contemporaries. In her extended introduction, Weissberg reflects on Rahel's writings and on the importance of this text in the development of Arendt's political theory. Weissberg also reveals the hidden story of how Arendt manipulated documents relating to Rahel Varnhagen to claim for herself a university position and reparation payments from the postwar German state.",3.61,388,Paperback, ,5,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/344043.Rahel_Varnhagen,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/344043.Rahel_Varnhagen

Valskyldskapane skildrar ein kollisjon mellom moral- og naturlovene. Utgangspunktet for romanen var teorien til den svenske kjemikaren Torbern Olof Bergman, som skildrar korleis to og to kjemiske bindingar vert løyste opp og så smeltar saman på tvers av elementa. Goethe overfører dette fenomenet, som vart kalla «valskyldskap», til dei fire hovudfigurane i romanen, to kvinner og to menn. Dette grunnkonseptet er basert på at naturkreftene som også kan tolkast som kjensler og lengt, overstyrer fornufta, moralen og dei tronge, tradisjonelle rammene i samfunnet. Goethe såg sjølv på Valskyldskapane som eit av sine mest vellykka verk. Med romanen skreiv den elles så positivt innstilte bestseljarforfattaren sin einaste eigentlege tragedie. Han brukte element frå den greske tragedien, kombinert med element frå romantikken, som han sjølv var ein uttalt motstandar av, og enkelte har lese verket som ein parodi på romantikken. - Det er ikkje ei einaste linje i Valskyldskapane eg ikkje kunne ha opplevd sjølv, sa forfattaren nokre år før sin død, og overlét tolkinga av i kva grad det er Goethe sjølv vi møter i boka, til lesaren.",3.73, , , ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345453.Elective_Affinities,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345453.Elective_Affinities

Participating in this twice-yearly ritual, so friendly and benign in its apparent goals, parents and teachers are often wracked with anxiety. In a meeting marked by decorum and politeness, they frequently exhibit wariness and assume defensive postures. Even though the conversation appears to be focused on the student, adults may find themselves playing out their own childhood histories, insecurities, and fears.<br /><br />Through vivid portraits and parables, Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot captures the dynamics of this complex, intense relationship from the perspective of both parents and teachers. She also identifies new principles and practices for improving family-school relationships. In a voice that combines the passion of a mother, the skepticism of a social scientist, and the keen understanding of one of our nation’s most admired educators, Lawrence-Lightfoot offers penetrating analysis and an urgent call to arms for all those who want to act in the best interests of their children.<br /><br />For parents and teachers who seek productive dialogues and collaborative alliances in support of the learning and growth of their children, this book will offer valuable insights, incisive lessons, and deft guidance on how to communicate more effectively. In <b>The Essential Conversation</b>, Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot brings scholarship, warmth, and wisdom to an immensely important cultural subject—the way we raise our children.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.65,288,Paperback, ,29,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345475.The_Essential_Conversation,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345475.The_Essential_Conversation

Questions about the construction and the purpose of these majestic monuments have existed since the middle period of ancient Egyptian civilization, but recent cutting-edge research has uncovered information about how and why they were built. In Mountains of the Pharaohs, Zahi Hawass, a world-renowned archaeologist and the official guardian of Egypt’s timeless treasures, weaves the latest archaeological data and an enthralling family history into spellbinding narrative.<br /><br />Nearly five thousand years ago, the 4th Dynasty of Egypt’s Old Kingdom reigned over a highly advanced civilization. Believed to be gods, the royal family lived amid colossal palaces and temples built to honor them and their deified ancestors. Hawass brings these extraordinary historical figures to life, spinning a soap opera–like saga complete with murder, incest, and the triumphant ascension to the throne of one of only four queens ever to rule Egypt.<br /><br />The magnificent pyramids attest not only to the dynasty’s supreme power, but also to the engineering expertise and architectural sophistication that flourished under their rule.

She believes that ""pleasure is good, shame is bad, and knowledge is power."" Ruth's younger daughter's soccer coach is Tim Mason, a former stoner and rocker whose response to hitting rock bottom was to reach out and be saved.

But how can we know that this computing is trustworthy? In <i>Mechanizing Proof</i>, Donald MacKenzie addresses this key issue by investigating the interrelations of computing, risk, and mathematical proof over the last half century from the perspectives of history and sociology. His discussion draws on the technical literature of computer science and artificial intelligence and on extensive interviews with participants.MacKenzie argues that our culture now contains two ideals of proof: proof as traditionally conducted by human mathematicians, and formal, mechanized proof. He describes the systems constructed by those committed to the latter ideal and the many questions those systems raise about the nature of proof. He looks at the primary social influence on the development of automated proof--the need to predict the behavior of the computer systems upon which human life and security depend--and explores the involvement of powerful organizations such as the National Security Agency. He concludes that in mechanizing proof, and in pursuing dependable computer systems, we do not obviate the need for trust in our collective human judgment.",4.50,440,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347429.Mechanizing_Proof,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347429.Mechanizing_Proof

Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo, he looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and ultimately slashed its population by ten million—all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century, in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions, a man as cunning, charming, and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries, travelers, and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her, he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel, a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale, the Irish patriot Roger Casement, ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans, George Washington Williams and William Sheppard, risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all, the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion, King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo—too long forgotten—onto the conscience of the West.",4.15,376,Paperback, ,2006,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347610.King_Leopold_s_Ghost,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347610.King_Leopold_s_Ghost

His agenda in this tome, which was first published in 1978 but didn't become a bestseller until 1983, is to reconcile the psychoanalytic tradition with the conflicting cultural currents roiling the 70s. In the spirit of Me-Decade individualism and libertinism, he celebrates self-actualization as life's highest purpose and flirts with the notions of open marriage and therapeutic sex between patient and analyst. But because he is attuned to the nascent conservative backlash against the therapeutic worldview, Peck also cites Gospel passages, recruits psychotherapy to the cause of traditional religion (he even convinces a patient to sign up for divinity school) and insists that problems must be overcome through suffering, discipline and hard work (with a therapist.) Often departing from the cerebral and rationalistic bent of Freudian discourse for a mystical, Jungian tone more compatible with New Age spirituality, Peck writes of psychotherapy as an exercise in ""love"" and ""spiritual growth,"" asserts that ""our unconscious is God"" and affirms his belief in miracles, reincarnation and telepathy. Peck's synthesis of such clashing elements (he even throws in a little thermodynamics) is held together by a warm and lucid discussion of psychiatric principles and moving accounts of his own patients' struggles and breakthroughs.

    <b>A laugh-out-loud look at the most underrated supporting role in today's maxed-out wedding world, featuring ""bad bridesmaids"" who've had enough taffeta to last a lifetime</b>
  </div>
  <div><br />I just can't have any negative energy around my wedding."" This is what Siri Agrell's best friend told her just before kicking her out of the wedding that Agrell had spent many months--and dollars--preparing for. Her offense? It's not that she slept with the groom, or even the best man. She didn't get drunk at the shower. She didn't buy the cheapest casserole dish on the registry.</div>
  <div><br />But she did question the role of today's much-maligned bridesmaid in an article she wrote for a national newspaper. Despite the bags of fan mail the piece generated, the bride was not amused. Agrell was booted from the bridal party in favor of a similarly sized cousin--and no, she did not get reimbursed for the $100 gold shoes she'd already bought to match the bridesmaid dress.</div>
  <div><br />Now she's putting all that experience and fan mail to good use: like no other book on the market, <i>Bad Bridesmaid</i> is a hilarious tale of weddings gone wild, full of anecdotes and advice from women worldwide, and the perfect gift to get former, current, and future bridesmaids ready for action (or therapy). It's time to give the bridesmaid back her voice, her independence, and the natural waistline that has long been hidden under layers of responsibility and badly constructed tulle!</div>

But throughout history there have been moments of vital importance that have taken place not on the battlefield, or in the palaces of power, or even in the violence of nature, but between the pages of a book. In our digitised age of instant information it is easy to underestimate the power of the printed word. In his fascinating new book accompanying the ITV series, Melvyn Bragg presents a vivid reminder of the book as agent of social, political and personal revolution. Twelve Books that Changed the World presents a rich variety of human endeavour and a great diversity of characters. There are also surprises. Here are famous books by Darwin, Newton and Shakespeare -- but we also discover the stories behind some less well-known works, such as Marie Stopes' Married Love, the original radical feminist Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman -- and even the rules to an obscure ball game that became the most popular sport in the world ...",3.49,372,Paperback, ,18,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350320.12_Books_That_Changed_the_World,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350320.12_Books_That_Changed_the_World

God is found in the desert of surrender, in giving up any expectation of a particular message and 'waiting on the Word of God in silence'.

But so do the suburbs. In a phenomenon unparalleled in the social history of modern, postwar America, more than 138,000,000 Americans -- the majority of our national population -- now live in suburbs; for the most part, happily. And Tom Martinson, a city planner whose fieldwork for this book has taken him to more than a hundred communities throughout the United States, has discovered why.Whereas recent titles like Suburban Nation and Jane Holz Kay's Asphalt Nation have attracted media attention for their indictments of suburbia as an American nightmare, this lucid, incisive volume displays conclusively that the suburbs, which are no less various than they are ubiquitous, defy the stereotypes of urbanist critics. Separating biases that characterize suburban communities as vacuous, wasteful, centerless places from their actuality, Martinson traces the evolution of suburbs over the past two centuries, examines the values that challenge and unsettle the urbanists, investigates charges that government unfairly favors suburbs over cities, and considers possibilities for the future development of suburbia.<br /><br />Martinson knows the issues, and asks some billion-dollar questions.

Although she had confessed to committing a long list of <i>maleficia</i> (deeds of harmful magic), including killing forty—one infants and two mothers in labor, her evil career allegedly began with just one heinous act—sex with a demon. Fornication with demons was a major theme of her trial record, which detailed an almost continuous orgy of sexual excess with her diabolical paramour Federlin ""in many divers places, . . . even in the street by night.""<br /><br />As Walter Stephens demonstrates in <i>Demon Lovers,</i> it was not Hausmännin or other so-called witches who were obsessive about sex with demons—instead, a number of devout Christians, including trained theologians, displayed an uncanny preoccupation with the topic during the centuries of the ""witch craze."" Why? To find out, Stephens conducts a detailed investigation of the first and most influential treatises on witchcraft (written between 1430 and 1530), including the infamous <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> (<i>Hammer of Witches</i>).<br /><br />Far from being credulous fools or mindless misogynists, early writers on witchcraft emerge in Stephens's account as rational but reluctant skeptics, trying desperately to resolve contradictions in Christian thought on God, spirits, and sacraments that had bedeviled theologians for centuries. Proof of the physical existence of demons—for instance, through evidence of their intercourse with mortal witches—would provide strong evidence for the reality of the supernatural, the truth of the Bible, and the existence of God. Early modern witchcraft theory reflected a crisis of belief—a crisis that continues to be expressed today in popular debates over angels, Satanic ritual child abuse, and alien abduction.<br />",3.72,478,Paperback, ,4,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/353409.Demon_Lovers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/353409.Demon_Lovers

</i> It is a unique, comprehensive view of medicine, a holistic approach to healing that integrates the four aspects of our bodies: the Physical, the Life Force, the Emotional, and the Mental. Its principles are simple: right diet for healing the physical body; beneficial medicines or therapies for the life-force body, healing movement and exercise for the emotional body, and effective thinking activity for the mental body. <br /><br />Dr. Cowan merges the wisdom of traditional societies, the most modern findings of western medicine and the esoteric teachings of the ancients as he works to answer this most important question: How do we obtain true health? <br /><br /><i>
  <b>The Fourfold Path</b>

For Heidegger, it is by neglecting the former primordial concept of truth in favor of the latter derivative concept that Western philosophy, beginning already with Plato, took off on its ""metaphysical"" course towards the bankruptcy of the present day. This first ever translation into English consists of a lecture course delivered by Heidegger at the University of Freiburg in 1931-32.

Instead she’s trapped in East Village, Manitoba, a small town whose population is Mennonite: “the most embarrassing sub-sect of people to belong to if you’re a teenager.” East Village is a town with no train and no bar whose job prospects consist of slaughtering chickens at the Happy Family Farms abattoir or churning butter for tourists at the pioneer village. Ministered with an iron fist by Nomi’s uncle Hans, a.k.a. The Mouth of Darkness, East Village is a town that’s tall on rules and short on fun: no dancing, drinking, rock ’n’ roll, recreational sex, swimming, make-up, jewellery, playing pool, going to cities or staying up past nine o’clock.<br /><br />As the novel begins, Nomi struggles to cope with the back-to-back departures three years earlier of Tash, her beautiful and mouthy sister, and Trudie, her warm and spirited mother. She lives with her father, Ray, a sweet yet hapless schoolteacher whose love is unconditional but whose parenting skills amount to benign neglect. Father and daughter deal with their losses in very different ways. Ray, a committed elder of the church, seeks to create an artificial sense of order by reorganizing the city dump late at night. Nomi, on the other hand, favours chaos as she tries to blunt her pain through “drugs and imagination.” Together they live in a limbo of unanswered questions.<br /><br />Nomi’s first person narrative shifts effortlessly between the present and the past. Within the present, Nomi goes through the motions of finishing high school while flagrantly rebelling against Mennonite tradition. She hangs out on Suicide Hill, hooks up with a boy named Travis, goes on the Pill, wanders around town, skips class and cranks Led Zeppelin. But the past is never far from her mind as she remembers happy times with her mother and sister — as well as the painful events that led them to flee town. Throughout, in a voice both defiant and vulnerable, she offers hilarious and heartbreaking reflections on life, death, family, faith and love.<br /><br />Eventually Nomi’s grief — and a growing sense of hypocrisy — cause her to spiral ever downward to a climax that seems at once startling and inevitable. But even when one more loss is heaped on her piles of losses, Nomi maintains hope and finds the imagination and willingness to envision what lies beyond.<br /><br />Few novels in recent years have generated as much excitement as <b>A Complicated Kindness</b>. Winner of the Governor General’s Award and a Giller Prize Finalist, Miriam Toews’s third novel has earned both critical acclaim and a long and steady position on our national bestseller lists. In the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, author Bill Richardson writes the following: “There is so much that’s accomplished and fine. The momentum of the narrative, the quality of the storytelling, the startling images, the brilliant rendering of a time and place, the observant, cataloguing eye of the writer, her great grace. But if I had to name Miriam Toews’s crowning achievement, it would be the creation of Nomi Nickel, who deserves to take her place beside Daisy Goodwill Flett, Pi Patel and Hagar Shipley as a brilliantly realized character for whom the reader comes to care, okay, comes to love.”<br /><br /><br /><i>This town is so severe. And silent. It makes me crazy, the silence. I wonder if a person can die from it. The town office building has a giant filing cabinet full of death certificates that say choked to death on his own anger or suffocated from unexpressed feelings of unhappiness. Silentium. People here just can’t wait to die, it seems. It’s the main event. The only reason we’re not all snuffed at birth is because that would reduce our suffering by a lifetime. My guidance counsellor has suggested to me that I change my attitude about this place and learn to love it. But I do, I told her. Oh, that’s rich, she said. That’s rich. . .<br /><br />We’re Mennonites. After Dukhobors who show up naked in court we are the most embarrassing sub-sect of people to belong to if you’re a teenager. Five hundred years ago in Europe a man named Menno Simons set off to do his own peculiar religious thing and he and his followers were beaten up and killed or forced to conform all over Holland, Poland, and Russia until they, at least some of them, finally landed right here where I sit. Imagine the least well-adjusted kid in your school starting a breakaway clique of people whose manifesto includes a ban on the media, dancing, smoking , temperate climates, movies, drinking, rock’n’roll, having sex for fun, swimming, makeup, jewellery, playing pool, going to cities, or staying up past nine o’clock. That was Menno all over.

Board of Education, brought the promise of integration to Little Rock, Arkansas, but it was hard-won for the nine black teenagers chosen to integrate Central High School in 1957. They ran the gauntlet between a rampaging mob and the heavily armed Arkansas National Guard, dispatched by Governor Orval Faubus to subvert federal law and bar them from entering the school. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by sending in soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division, the elite ""Screaming Eagles"" - and transformed Melba Pattillo and her eight friends into reluctant warriors on the battlefield of civil rights. May 17, 1994, marks the fortieth anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, which was argued and won by Thurgood Marshall, whose passion and presence emboldened the Little Rock struggle. Melba Pattillo Beals commemorates the milestone decision in this first-person account of her ordeal at the center of the violent confrontation that helped shape the civil rights movement. Beals takes us from the lynch mob that greeted the terrified fifteen-year-old to a celebrity homecoming with her eight compatriots thirty years later, on October 23, 1987, hosted by Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton in the mansion that Faubus built. As they returned to tour the halls of the school, gathering from myriad professions and all corners of the country, they were greeted by the legacy of their courage - a bespectacled black teenager, the president of the student body at Central High. Beals chronicles her harrowing junior year at Central High, when she began each school day by polishing her saddle shoes and bracing herself for battle.

How, for example, does the mother whose soldier son is missing in action, or the family of an Alzheimer's patient who is suffering from severe dementia, deal with the uncertainty surrounding this kind of loss?<br /><br /><br /><br />In this sensitive and lucid account, Pauline Boss explains that, all too often, those confronted with such ambiguous loss fluctuate between hope and hopelessness. Suffered too long, these emotions can deaden feeling and make it impossible for people to move on with their lives. Yet the central message of this book is that they can move on. Drawing on her research and clinical experience, Boss suggests strategies that can cushion the pain and help families come to terms with their grief. Her work features the heartening narratives of those who cope with ambiguous loss and manage to leave their sadness behind, including those who have lost family members to divorce, immigration, adoption, chronic mental illness, and brain injury. With its message of hope, this eloquent book offers guidance and understanding to those struggling to regain their lives.",3.97,155,Paperback, ,54,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357127.Ambiguous_Loss,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357127.Ambiguous_Loss

W. Norton  Company,eng,false,"It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century. It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mind—the so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.<br /><br /><em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em> is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.<br /><br /><br />Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.<br /><br /><br />Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: <em>The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</em> under the general editorship of James Strachey.<br /><br /><br />Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the <em>Standard Edition</em> in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions.<br />",3.79,127,Paperback, ,762,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357636.Civilization_and_Its_Discontents,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/357636.Civilization_and_Its_Discontents

But that peace is shattered by the discovery of a dead infant in the barn of an Amish farmer. A police investigation quickly leads to two startling disclosures: the newborn's mother is an unmarried Amish woman, eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher. And the infant did not die of natural causes. Although Katie denies the medical proof that she gave birth to the child, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest for the murder of her baby. <br /><br />One hundred miles away, Philadelphia defense attorney Ellie Hathaway has achieved an enviable, high-profile career. But her latest court victory has set the sands shifting beneath her. Single at thirty-nine and unsatisfied with her relationship, Ellie doesn't look back when she turns down her chance to make partner and takes off for an open-ended stay at her great-aunt's home in Paradise. Fate brings her to Katie Fisher. Suddenly, Ellie sees the chance to defend a client who truly needs her, not just one who can afford her. <br /><br />But taking on this case challenges Ellie in more ways than one. She finds herself not only in a clash of wills with a client who does not want to be defended but also in a clash of cultures with a people whose channels of justice are markedly different from her own. Immersing herself in Katie Fisher's life -- and in a world founded on faith, humility, duty, and honesty -- Ellie begins to understand the pressures and sacrifices of those who to live plain. As she peels away the layers of fact and fantasy, Ellie calls on an old friend for guidance. Now, just as this man from Ellie's past reenters her life, she must uncover the truth about a complex case, a tragic loss, the bonds of love -- and her own deepest fears and desires.",3.97,422,Paperback, ,204,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358663.Plain_Truth,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358663.Plain_Truth

They called her Sila van den Kaap, slave woman of Jacobus Stephanus Van der Wat of Plettenberg Bay, South Africa. A woman moved from master to master, farm to farm, and—driven by the horrors of slavery to commit an unspeakable crime—from prison to prison. A woman fit for hanging . . . condemned to death on April 30, 1823, but whose sentence the English, having recently wrested authority from the Dutch settlers, saw fit to commute to a lengthy term on the notorious Robben Island. <br /><br />Sila spends her days in the prison quarry, breaking stones for Cape Town’s streets and walls. She remembers the day her childhood ended, when slave catchers came “whipping the air and the ground and we were like deer whipped into the smaller and smaller circle of our fear.” Sila remembers her masters, especially Oumiesies (“old Missus”), who in her will granted Sila her freedom, but Theron, Oumiesies’ vicious and mercenary son, destroys the will and with it Sila’s life. Sila remembers her children, with joy and with pain, and imagines herself a great bird that could sweep them up in her wings and set them safely on a branch above all harm.

The passion that furtively develops between them--along with Callie's failure to develop--leads Callie to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all. <br />The explanation for this shocking state of affairs takes us out of suburbia- back before the Detroit race riots of 1967, before the rise of the Motor City and Prohibition, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie's grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set in motion the metamorphosis that will turn Callie into a being both mythical and perfectly real: a hermaphrodite. <br />Spanning eight decades--and one unusually awkward adolescence- Jeffrey Eugenides's long-awaited second novel is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire.

The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own.

Already a notorious Nazi-supported rabble-rouser when he was appointed commissioner, he set about to eliminate the Jews with particularly brutal efficiency. Darquier was in charge of the Vel' d'Hiv' round-up in Paris in which nearly 13,000 Jews were dispatched to death camps. Most of the French who died in Auschwitz were sent there during his tenure. Almost all of the 11,400 French children sent to Auschwitz--the majority of whom did not survive--were deported in his time. In all, he delivered 75,000 French to the Nazis and, at the same time, accelerated the confiscation of Jewish property, which he then used for his own financial gain. Never brought to justice, he lived out his life comfortably in Spain, denying his involvement in the Holocaust until his last days. <br />Where did Louis Darquier come from? How did this man--a chronic fantasist and hypocrite, gambler and cheat--come to control the fates of thousands? What made him what he was? These are the questions at the center of this extraordinary book. In answering them, Carmen Callil gives us a superlatively detailed and revealing tapestry of individuals and ideologies, of small lives and great events, the forces of government and of personalities--in France and across the European continent--that made Vichy possible, and turned Darquier into its ""dark essence."" <br />A tour de force of memory, accountability, and acknowledgment, ""Bad Faith"" is a brilliant meld of grand inquisitive sweep and delicate psychological insight, a story of how past choices and actions echo down to the present day, and an invaluable addition to the literature and history of the Holocaust.",3.86,607,Hardcover, ,13,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/362670.Bad_Faith,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/362670.Bad_Faith

Some even argued that the massacres and outrages on both sides were too horrific to ""deserve the name of a war.""<br /><br />It all began when Philip (called Metacom by his own people), the leader of the Wampanoag Indians, led attacks against English towns in the colony of Plymouth. The war spread quickly, pitting a loose confederation of southeastern Algonquians against a coalition of English colonists. While it raged, colonial armies pursued enemy Indians through the swamps and woods of New England, and Indians attacked English farms and towns from Narragansett Bay to the Connecticut River Valley. Both sides, in fact, had pursued the war seemingly without restraint, killing women and children, torturing captives, and mutilating the dead. The fighting ended after Philip was shot, quartered, and beheaded in August 1676.<br /><br />The war's brutality compelled the colonists to defend themselves against accusations that they had become savages. But Jill Lepore makes clear that it was after the war--and because of it--that the boundaries between cultures, hitherto blurred, turned into rigid ones. King Philip's War became one of the most written-about wars in our history, and Lepore argues that the words strengthened and hardened feelings that, in turn, strengthened and hardened the enmity between Indians and Anglos. She shows how, as late as the nineteenth century, memories of the war were instrumental in justifying Indian removals--and how in our own century that same war has inspired Indian attempts to preserve ""Indianness"" as fiercely as the early settlers once struggled to preserve their Englishness.<br /><br />Telling the story of what may have been the bitterest of American conflicts, and its reverberations over the centuries, Lepore has enabled us to see how the ways in which we remember past events are as important in their effect on our history as were the events themselves.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.96,368,Paperback, ,115,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363659.The_Name_of_War,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363659.The_Name_of_War

Applying economic analysis to the subjects of the political scientist, sociologist, and economist, Mancur Olson examines the extent to which the individuals that share a common interest find it in their individual interest to bear the costs of the organizational effort.<br /><br />The theory shows that most organizations produce what the economist calls ""public goods""--goods or services that are available to every member, whether or not he has borne any of the costs of providing them. Economists have long understood that defense, law, and order were public goods that could not be marketed to individuals, and that taxation was necessary. They have not, however, taken account of the fact that private as well as governmental organizations produce public goods.<br /><br />The services the labor union provides for the worker it represents, or the benefits a lobby obtains for the group it represents, are public goods: they automatically go to every individual in the group, whether or not he helped bear the costs. It follows that, just as governments require compulsory taxation, many large private organizations require special (and sometimes coercive) devices to obtain the resources they need. This is not true of smaller organizations for, as this book shows, small and large organizations support themselves in entirely different ways. The theory indicates that, though small groups can act to further their interest much more easily than large ones, they will tend to devote too few resources to the satisfaction of their common interests, and that there is a surprising tendency for the ""lesser"" members of the small group to exploit the ""greater"" members by making them bear a disproportionate share of the burden of any group action.<br /><br />All of the theory in the book is in Chapter 1; the remaining chapters contain empirical and historical evidence of the theory's relevance to labor unions, pressure groups, corporations, and Marxian class action.",3.98,186,Paperback, ,37,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369409.The_Logic_of_Collective_Action,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369409.The_Logic_of_Collective_Action

Millones de ejemplares de Cien años de Soledad leídos en todas las lenguas y el premio Nobel de Literatura coronando una obra que se había abierto paso ""boca a boca"".<br /><br />La Real Academia Española y la Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española presentan Cien años de soledad, una edición popular conmemorativa cuyo texto ha revisado el propio Gabriel García Márquez. A pesar del esmero con que el propio escritor corrigió las pruebas de la primera edición (Sudamericana, 1967), se deslizaron en ella indeseadas erratas y expresiones dudosas que editores sucesivos han tratado de resolver con mejor o peor fortuna. Un estudio comparativo detallado de cada caso ha permitido ahora presentar una propuesta razonada al propio autor, que ha querido revisar las pruebas de imprenta completas, enriqueciendo así esta edición con su trabajo de depuración y fijación del texto.</p>",4.08,752,Hardcover,Edición Commemorativa de la Real Academia Espanola (RAE) y la Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española (ASALE),1636,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/370523.Cien_a_os_de_soledad,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/370523.Cien_a_os_de_soledad
