For Philip Worthy, the adopted son of the town's founder, it is a haven in another sense-as the first place in his life he's had a loving family to call his own. <br />And yet, the ideals that define this outpost are being threatened from all sides. A world war is raging, and with the fear of spies rampant, the loyalty of all Americans is coming under scrutiny. Meanwhile, another shadow has fallen across the region in the form of a deadly illness striking down vast swaths of surrounding communities. <br />When Commonwealth votes to quarantine itself against contagion, guards are posted at the single road leading in and out of town, and Philip Worthy is among them. He will be unlucky enough to be on duty when a cold, hungry, tired-and apparently ill-soldier presents himself at the town's doorstep begging for sanctuary. The encounter that ensues, and the shots that are fired, will have deafening reverberations throughout Commonwealth, escalating until every human value-love, patriotism, community, family, friendship-not to mention the town's very survival, is imperiled. <br />Inspired by a little-known historical footnote regarding towns that quarantined themselves during the 1918 epidemic, ""The Last Town on Earth"" is a remarkably moving and accomplished debut.",3.64,387,Hardcover, ,888,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76336.The_Last_Town_on_Earth,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76336.The_Last_Town_on_Earth

Combined with his deft black and white depictions of urbane lifestyles, Tomine's fans have often accused him of eavesdropping in on their most intimate moments and, with forensic skill, laying their lives bare.

He watches close up, paralyzed by his guilt, as her beauty catches the eye of his neighbor: a hip, selfish young man with a short attention span.

Jane's sharp wit and defiant nature meet with Rochester's sardonic temperament. The two become enmeshed in a deep, intense bond.

Set in almost uninhabitable regions of Central Australia, <i>The Songlines</i> asks and tries to answer these questions: Why is man the most restless, dissatisfied of animals? Why do wandering people conceive the world as perfect whereas sedentary ones always try to change it? Why have the great teachers—Christ or the Buddha—recommended the Road as the way. to salvation? Do we agree with Pascal that all man's troubles stem from his inability to sit quietly in a room?<br /><br />We do not often ask these questions today for we commonly assume that living in a house is normal and that the wandering life is aberrant. But for more than twenty years Chatwin has mulled over the possibility that the reverse might be the case.<br /><br />Pre-colonial Australia was the last landmass on earth peopled not by herdsmen, farmers, or city dwellers, but by hunter-gatherers. Their labyrinths of invisible pathways across the continent are known to us as Songlines or Dreaming Tracks, but to the Aboriginals as the tracks of their ancestors—the Way of the Law. Along these ""roads"" they travel in order to perform all those activities that are distinctively human—song, dance, marriage, exchange of ideas, and arrangements of territorial boundaries by agreement rather than force.<br /><br />In Chatwin's search for the Songlines, Arkady is an ideal friend and guide: Australian by birth, the son of a Cossack exile, with all the strength and warmth of his inheritance. Whether hunting kangaroo from a Land Cruiser, talking to the diminutive Rolf in his book-crammed trailer, buying drinks for a bigoted policeman (and would-be writer), cheering as Arkady's true love declares herself (part of <i>The Songlines</i> is a romantic comedy), Chatwin turns this almost implausible picaresque adventure into something approaching the scale of a Greek tragedy.<br /><br />The life of the Aboriginals stands in vivid contrast, of course, to the prevailing cultures of our time. And <i>The Songlines</i> presents unforgettable details about the kinds of disputes we know all too well from less traumatic confrontations: over sacred lands invaded by railroads, mines, and construction sites, over the laws and rights of a poor people versus a wealthy invasive one. To Chatwin these are but recent, local examples of an eternal basic distinction between settlers and wanderers. His book, devoted to the latter, is a brilliant evocation of this profound optimism: that man is by nature not a bellicose aggressor but a pacific, song-creating, adaptive species whose destiny is to quest for the truth.",3.98,304,Paperback, ,466,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76844.The_Songlines,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76844.The_Songlines

But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.<br /><br />But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.<br /><br />All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative -- the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.<br /><br />Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England.

The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.<br /><br />The Challenge<br />Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. <br /><br />But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? <br /><br />The Study<br />For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?<br /><br />The Standards<br />Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. <br /><br />The Comparisons<br />The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? <br /><br />The Findings<br />The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:<br />Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.<br /><br />The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.<br /><br />A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results.

</b>The Stainless Steel Rat (1961): DiGriz is caught during one of his crimes &amp; recruited into the Special Corps. Boring, routine desk work during his probationary period results in his discovering that someone is building a battleship, thinly disguised as an industrial vessel. In the peaceful League no one has battleships any more, so the builder of this one would be unstoppable. DiGriz' hunt for the guilty becomes a personal battle between himself &amp; the beautiful but deadly Angelina, who is planning a coup on one of the feudal worlds. DiGriz' dilemma is whether he will turn Angelina over to the Special Corps, or join with her, since he's fallen in love with her.<p>The Stainless Steel Rat's Revenge (1970): DiGriz &amp; Angelina are happily married, expecting the birth of sons. The planet Cliaand is waging interstellar war. Against the odds, its Grey Men are invading &amp; taking over planet after planet. The Rat is sent to Cliaand to start a one-man guerrilla campaign to put a stop to the plans of the planet's leader, Kraj. He is aided by the Amazons, a force of liberated freedom fighters, &amp; eventually by his wife who arrives to help him win the war &amp; keep him out of the arms of the Amazons.</p><p>The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World (1972): The villainous He has travelled back in time to humankind's distant past on the legendary planet Earth ('Dirt') of '84, where he's altering events so that people who opposed him in the Rat's present cease to exist, Angelina amongst them. Using the Helix, a time-travel device invented by the Special Corps' Prof. Coypu, diGriz travels to '84 America, then to Napoleonic France where tanks &amp; aircraft are helping bring about Napoleon's victory.</p>",4.11,402,Mass Market Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77153.The_Adventures_of_the_Stainless_Steel_Rat,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77153.The_Adventures_of_the_Stainless_Steel_Rat

And out in the country, two brothers, elderly bachelors, work the family homestead, the only world they've ever known.<br /><br />From these unsettled lives emerges a vision of life, and of the town and landscape that bind them together—their fates somehow overcoming the powerful circumstances of place and station, their confusion, curiosity, dignity and humor intact and resonant.

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.</i><br /><br />So begins the luminous memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank’s mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank’s father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible, and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father’s tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies.<br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank’s survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig’s head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance, and remarkable forgiveness.<br /><br />Angela’s Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt’s astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.</p>",4.11,364,Hardcover,1st Edition,558,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77344.Angela_s_Ashes,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77344.Angela_s_Ashes

And it is the story of the British commander, William Howe, and his highly disciplined redcoats, who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known. But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost: Washington, who had never before led an army in battle.<br /><br />The darkest hours of that tumultuous year were as dark as any Americans have known. Especially in our own tumultuous time, 1776 is powerful testimony to how much is owed to a rare few in that brave founding epoch, and what a miracle it was that things turned out as they did.<br /><br />Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.<br /><br />©2005 David McCullough; (P)2005 Simon and Schuster Inc.",4.07,386,Hardcover, ,321,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77347.1776,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77347.1776

William Boyd's novel Any Human Heart is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling ""my personal rollercoaster""--or rather, ""not so much a rollercoaster"", but a yo-yo, ""a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child."" From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism, and abject poverty.<br /><br />Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall Any Human Heart is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. --Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk",4.28,480,Paperback, ,1139,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77866.Any_Human_Heart,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77866.Any_Human_Heart

They set the fashions, encouraged the arts, and, in some cases, ruled nations. Eleanor Herman's Sex with Kings takes us into the throne rooms and bedrooms of Europe's most powerful monarchs. Alive with flamboyant characters, outrageous humor, and stirring poignancy, this glittering tale of passion and politics chronicles five hundred years of scintillating women and the kings who loved them.<br /><br />Curiously, the main function of a royal mistress was not to provide the king with sex but with companionship. Forced to marry repulsive foreign princesses, kings sought solace with women of their own choice. And what women they were! From Madame de Pompadour, the famous mistress of Louis XV, who kept her position for nineteen years despite her frigidity, to modern-day Camilla Parker-Bowles, who usurped none other than the glamorous Diana, Princess of Wales.<br /><br />The successful royal mistress made herself irreplaceable. She was ready to converse gaily with him when she was tired, make love until all hours when she was ill, and cater to his every whim. Wearing a mask of beaming delight over any and all discomforts, she was never to be exhausted, complaining, or grief-stricken.<br /><br />True, financial rewards for services rendered were of royal proportions -- some royal mistresses earned up to $200 million in titles, pensions, jewels, and palaces. Some kings allowed their mistresses to exercise unlimited political power. But for all its grandeur, a royal court was a scorpion's nest of insatiable greed, unquenchable lust, and vicious ambition. Hundreds of beautiful women vied to unseat the royal mistress. Many would suffer the slings and arrows of negative public opinion, some met with tragic ends and were pensioned off to make room for younger women. But the royal mistress often had the last laugh, as she lived well and richly off the fruits of her ""sins.""<br /><br />From the dawn of time, power has been a mighty aphrodisiac. With diaries, personal letters, and diplomatic dispatches, Eleanor Herman's trailblazing research reveals the dynamics of sex and power, rivalry and revenge, at the most brilliant courts of Europe. Wickedly witty and endlessly entertaining, Sex with Kings is a chapter of women's history that has remained unwritten -- until now.",3.69,304,Paperback, ,686,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78393.Sex_with_Kings,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78393.Sex_with_Kings

At the center of the book is The Save Yourself Plan--a streamlined, five-month program that delivers genuine long-term financial security.

Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and clichés of the 1930s and 1940s, <i>The Blind Assassin</i> is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.<br /><br />It opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled <i>The Blind Assassin</i>, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.<br /><br />For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In <i>The Blind Assassin</i>, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. <i>The Blind Assassin</i> proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time.

Las brillantes incursiones en la historia, la filosofía, la ciencia y el arte, habituales en la extensa obra de este culto escritor, cuyos libros han sido traducidos en decenas de países, se entremezclan en este caso con un thriller acerca de uno de los mayores misterios de la reciente historia europea.<br /><br />Rudolf Herter es un renombrado escritor holandés, obsesionado con el nazismo. En Viena, durante una gira promocional de su última novela, protagoniza un inesperado encuentro: Ulrich y Julia Falk, una pareja de ancianos que han asistido fascinados a la conferencia del escritor, tienen una historia que contarle. El matrimonio había trabajado al servicio personal de Hitler y Eva Braun en su refugio montañoso de Berchtesgaden. En noviembre de 1938 se ven involucrados en una misión del más alto secreto: Eva Braun, embarazada de Hitler, da a luz a un varón, Sigfrido, pero el dictador nazi ordena que la existencia del pequeño quede en absoluto secreto, de modo que Sigfrido tiene que ser criado y educado como si fuera hijo del matrimonio Falk. Después, los avatares de la guerra mundial culminarán en una tragedia de tintes casi wagnerianos, cuyas consecuencias se dejan aún sentir en el presente.

Will they manage to pick up the thread of their strange love story, interrupted almost as soon as it began and then lost in the tides of history? The truth is that after such a long absence ""their memories no longer match."" We always believe that our memories coincide with those of the person we loved, that we experienced the same thing. But this is just an illusion. Then again, what can we expect of our weak memory? It records only ""an insignificant, minuscule particle"" of the past, ""and no one knows why it's this bit and not any other bit."" We live our lives sunk in a vast forgetting, a fact we refuse to recognize. Only those who return after twenty years, like Odysseus returning to his native Ithaca, can be dazzled and astounded by observing the goddess of ignorance firsthand.</p><p>Milan Kundera is the only author today who can take such dizzying concepts as absence, memory, forgetting, and ignorance, and transform them into material for a novel, masterfully orchestrating them into a polyphonic and moving work.</p><p>Author Biography: The Franco-Czech novelist Milan Kundera was born in Brno and has lived in France, his second homeland, for more than twenty years. </p><p>He is the author of the novels <i>The Joke, Life Is Elsewhere, The Farewell Party, The Books of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, </i>and<i> Immortality,</i> and the short story collection <i>Laughable Loves</i>, all originally written in Czech. </p><p>Like <i>Slowness,</i> his two earlier nonfiction works, <i>The Art ofthe Novel</i> and <i>Testaments Betrayed,</i> were originally written in French.</p>",3.78,195,Paperback, ,544,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78728.Ignorance,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78728.Ignorance

Nat Cartwright goes home with his parents, a schoolteacher and an insurance salesman. But his twin brother is to begin his days as Fletcher Andrew Davenport, the only son of a multi-millionaire and his society wife. <br /><br />During the years that follow, the two brothers grow up unaware of each other's existence.

Two years, 75 games, 2,642 correct answers, and over $2.5 million in winnings later, Ken Jennings emerged as trivia’s undisputed king. <i>Brainiac</i> traces his rise from anonymous computer programmer to nerd folk icon. But along the way, it also explores his newly conquered kingdom: the world of trivia itself.<br /><br />Jennings had always been minutiae-mad, poring over almanacs and TV Guide listings at an age when most kids are still watching Elmo and putting beans up their nose. But trivia, he has found, is centuries older than his childhood obsession with it. Whisking us from the coffeehouses of seventeenth-century London to the Internet age, Jennings chronicles the ups and downs of the trivia fad: the quiz book explosion of the Jazz Age; the rise, fall, and rise again of TV quiz shows; the nostalgic campus trivia of the 1960s; and the 1980s, when Trivial Pursuit® again made it fashionable to be a know-it-all.<br />Jennings also investigates the shadowy demimonde of today’s trivia subculture, guiding us on a tour of trivia hotspots across America. He goes head-to-head with the blowhards and diehards of the college quiz-bowl circuit, the slightly soused faithful of the Boston pub trivia scene, and the raucous participants in the annual Q&amp;A marathon in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, “The World’s Largest Trivia Contest.” And, of course, he takes us behind the scenes of his improbable 75-game run on Jeopardy!<br /><br />But above all, <i>Brainiac </i>is a love letter to the useless fact. What marsupial has fingerprints that are indistinguishable from human ones?* What planet has a crater on it named after Laura Ingalls Wilder?** What comedian had the misfortune to be born with the name “Albert Einstein”?*** Jennings also ponders questions that are a little more philosophical: What separates trivia from meaningless facts? Is being good at trivia a mark of intelligence? And is trivia just a waste of time, or does it serve some not-so-trivial purpose after all?<br /><br />Uproarious, silly, engaging, and erudite, this book is an irresistible celebration of nostalgia, curiosity, and nerdy obsession–in a word, trivia.<br /><br /><b>* The koala<br />** Venus<br />*** Albert Brooks</b><br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.90,288,Hardcover, ,356,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79195.Brainiac,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79195.Brainiac

Home, Witold Rybczynski seduced readers into a new appreciation of the spaces they live in. He also introduced us to ""an unerringly lucid writer who knows how to translate architectural ideas into layman's terms"" (The Dallas Morning News). Rybczynski's vast knowledge, his sense of wonder, and his elegantly uncluttered prose shine on every page of his latest meditation on the art of building. Looking Around is about architecture as an art of compromise - between beauty and function, aspiration and engineering, builders and clients. It is the story of the Seagram Building in New York and the Wexner Center for the Visual Arts in Columbus, Ohio - a museum that opened without a single painting on view, so that critics could better appreciate its design. But what of the visitors who want a building that displays art well? What of those who work in the building? Looking Around explores the notion of the architect as superstar and assesses giants from Palladio to Michael Graves, styles from classicism to high tech. It demonstrates how architecture actually works - or doesn't - in corporate headquarters, airports, private homes, and the special buildings designed to represent our civilization. For all its erudition, Looking Around is also bracingly straightforward. Rybczynski looks closely and critically at structures that may once have dazzled us with their ostentation and expense, and sees them as triumphs or failures - of aesthetic ideals and of lasting function. This is a fascinating and illuminating book about an art form integral to our lives.",3.86,301,Paperback, ,17,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79410.Looking_Around,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79410.Looking_Around

It is the tragic monologue of a woman speaking with the child she carries in her womb. This letter confronts the burning theme of abortion, and the meaning of life, by asking difficult questions: Is it fair to impose life even if it means suffering? Would it be better not to be born at all?<br />Letter to a Child Never Born touches on the real meaning of being a woman: the power to give life or not. When the book begins, the protagonist is upset after learning she is pregnant. She knows nothing about the child, except that this creature depends totally and uniquely on her own choices. The creation of another person directly within one’s own body is a very shocking thing. The sense of responsibility is huge; it is a heavy burden that gives life to endless reflections, from the origin of our existence to the shame of our selfishness. If the child could choose, would he prefer to be born, to grow up, and to suffer, or would he return to the joyful limbo from which he came? A woman’s freedom and individuality are also challenged by a newborn—should she renounce her freedom, her job, and her choice?

It gives man much to think about, that he has a way to receive and give certain knowledge about one's self which is useful and valuable. Life is largely a struggle in which man employs the known in an effort to conquer the unknown. Everywhere people are endeavoring to predict the future for meeting it in a more prepared manner. The whole story of the ECK-Vidya is the penetration into the realms of the generally unknown areas, not yet explored by the psychics, scientists, mystics or saints. The ECK-Vidya involves the principle of the cycles of life. It is up to the individula to learn these subtle changes and to make the adjustment as they arise. The minor changes always affect the greater changes. So when one is able to recognize and handle the very smaller cycles within himself, then he is able to bring about control over his life in the inner which controls his whole universe, that which he carries with himself at all times. ECKANKAR, of itself, is the highest path to God. But in its own broad and comprehensive aspects are included thirty or more facets or spiritual works, such as prophecy, healing, self-realization, the deja-vu powers, siddhi (spiritual knowledge), omnipresence, making events happen for one's own future, to name a few. All these are carried on upon a higher spiritual level than those of the occult, metaphysical and religious teachings. The vibrations of anyone practicing the ECK-Vidya are so high that those on the lower psychic scale can never be compared with them.",4.22,214,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79513.The_Eck_Vidya,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79513.The_Eck_Vidya

Wolff demonstrates the intimate connection between the composer's life and his music, showing how Bach's superb inventiveness pervaded his career as musician, composer, performer, scholar, and teacher.

Two years later, Ada Blackjack emerged as the sole survivor of this ambitious polar expedition. This young, unskilled woman--who had headed to the Arctic in search of money and a husband--conquered the seemingly unconquerable north and survived all alone after her male companions had perished.<br /><br /> Following her triumphant return to civilization, the international press proclaimed her the female Robinson Crusoe. But whatever stories the press turned out came from the imaginations of reporters: Ada Blackjack refused to speak to anyone about her horrific two years in the Arctic. Only on one occasion--after charges were published falsely accusing her of causing the death of one her companions--did she speak up for herself.<br /><br /> Jennifer Niven has created an absorbing, compelling history of this remarkable woman, taking full advantage of the wealth of first-hand resources about Ada that exist, including her never-before-seen diaries, the unpublished diaries from other primary characters, and interviews with Ada's surviving son. <i>Ada Blackjack</i> is more than a rugged tale of a woman battling the elements to survive in the frozen north--it is the story of a hero.",3.92,464,Paperback, ,18,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80103.Ada_Blackjack,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80103.Ada_Blackjack

He meets a fellow Pole, who ingeniously smuggles him back to Warsaw in a suitcase. Working on the black market, he soon rises to the top of Poland's emerging capitalist class. Still obsessively haunted by the image of his wife, Karol sets out to make her pay the price for her betrayal. The third and final part of the trilogy, ""Red,"" explores a strange, tentative relationship that gradualy grows between a beautiful young model and an embittered, retired judge.

He analyzed mental institutions in the remarkable <i>Madness and Civilization</i>; hospitals in <i>The Birth of the Clinic</i>; prisons in <i>Discipline and Punish</i>; and schools and families in <i>The History of Sexuality</i>. But the general reader as well as the specialist is apt to miss the consistent purposes that lay behind these difficult individual studies, thus losing sight of the broad social vision and political aims that unified them.<br /><br />Now, in this superb set of essays and interviews, Foucault has provided a much-needed guide to Foucault. These pieces, ranging over the entire spectrum of his concerns, enabled Foucault, in his most intimate and accessible voice, to interpret the conclusions of his research in each area and to demonstrate the contribution of each to the magnificent - and terrifying - portrait of society that he was patiently compiling.<br /><br />For, as Foucault shows, what he was always describing was the nature of power in society; not the conventional treatment of power that concentrates on powerful individuals and repressive institutions, but the much more pervasive and insidious mechanisms by which power ""reaches into the very grain of individuals, touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes, their discourses, learning processes and everyday lives.""<br /><br />Foucault's investigations of prisons, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories, cities, lodgings, families, and other organized forms of social life are each a segment of one of the most astonishing intellectual enterprises of all time - and, as this book proves, one which possesses profound implications for understanding the social control of our bodies and our minds.",4.14,288,Paperback, ,73,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80373.Power_Knowledge,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80373.Power_Knowledge

In the second act, however, the three women become representatives of the same person at different ages (26, 52, late 80s), and their bickering talk becomes a touching internal colloquy about life, love, and the inevitability of loss. Not since Beckett's brooding meditation Krapp's Last Tape has a playwright dealt so movingly with the subject of disappointment, aging, and death. - A.L.A.

How long will the bonds of family endure when confronted with swift, unexpected change? These are the intimate questions Jean Reynolds Page poses in <i>A Blessed Event</i>, her assured and powerful literary debut.<br /><br />Joanne Timbro and Darla Stevens have grown up in a small Texas town, their childhood homes separated only by adjoining backyards. Although the families inside these houses have little in common, the two girls find in each other a rare friendship that will take them into their adult lives; a friendship that makes them stronger together than either could be alone.<br /><br />Then as young women, Darla and Jo enter into an agreement that will startle everyone who cares for them. After years of watching Darla’s heartbreaking failure to have a baby with her husband, Cal, Joanne agrees to give birth to the child that Darla cannot have on her own.<br /><br />But in the early morning hours of a warm July morning, everything changes. Joanne, then four months pregnant, is driving a car that veers off the road near the home that Darla shares with Cal. In the days and months that follow, Darla must face for the first time in her memory, the possibility of life without Jo. As Darla tries to uncover the secrets that brought her friend out onto the highway in those dark morning hours, she discovers that she must also fight to keep the baby that was intended to be her child.<br /><br />With the child’s fate hanging in the balance, Darla searches for clues to Jo’s strange behavior leading up to the crash. In the process, she discovers truths that hide in her own life: in her marriage, in her closest friendships, and in a past that has suddenly reemerged, full of unfolding secrets.<br /><br />Tender and heartbreaking, hopeful and honest, <i>A Blessed Event</i> brings life’s everyday experiences into bright focus, contrasting beautifully the pain of suffering with the sublime joys of surviving—and truly living.",3.32,368,Paperback, ,39,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80558.A_Blessed_Event,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80558.A_Blessed_Event

Robert Oppenheimer, ""father of the atomic bomb,"" the brilliant, charismatic physicist who led the effort to capture the awesome fire of the sun for his country in time of war. Immediately after Hiroshima, he became the most famous scientist of his generation-one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, the embodiment of modern man confronting the consequences of scientific progress. <br /><br />He was the author of a radical proposal to place international controls over atomic materials-an idea that is still relevant today. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb and criticized the Air Force's plans to fight an infinitely dangerous nuclear war. In the now almost-forgotten hysteria of the early 1950s, his ideas were anathema to powerful advocates of a massive nuclear buildup, and, in response, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss, Superbomb advocate Edward Teller and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover worked behind the scenes to have a hearing board find that Oppenheimer could not be trusted with America's nuclear secrets. <br />American Prometheus sets forth Oppenheimer's life and times in revealing and unprecedented detail. Exhaustively researched, it is based on thousands of records and letters gathered from archives in America and abroad, on massive FBI files and on close to a hundred interviews with Oppenheimer's friends, relatives and colleagues.<br /><br />We follow him from his earliest education at the turn of the twentieth century at New York City's Ethical Culture School, through personal crises at Harvard and Cambridge universities. Then to Germany, where he studied quantum physics with the world's most accomplished theorists; and to Berkeley, California, where he established, during the 1930s, the leading American school of theoretical physics, and where he became deeply involved with social justice causes and their advocates, many of whom were communists. Then to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he transformed a bleak mesa into the world's most potent nuclear weapons laboratory-and where he himself was transformed. And finally, to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, which he directed from 1947 to 1966. <br /><br /><i>American Prometheus</i> is a rich evocation of America at midcentury, a new and compelling portrait of a brilliant, ambitious, complex and flawed man profoundly connected to its major events—the Depression, World War II and the Cold War. It is at once biography and history, and essential to our understanding of our recent past—and of our choices for the future.",4.07,725,Paperback, ,688,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80571.American_Prometheus,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80571.American_Prometheus

The twenty-six-year-old has abandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and chosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of people who call themselves Harlequins—a fierce group of warriors willing to sacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.<br /><br />Gabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since childhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father was a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced the course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and have for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who may have inherited their father's gifts, have always protected themselves by living “off the Grid”—that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks that monitor people in our modern society.<br /><br />Summoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. The Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the Tabula—ruthless mercenaries who have hunted Travelers for generations. This group is determined to inflict order on the world by controlling it, and they view Travelers as an intolerable threat. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly pulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle looms—one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael Corrigan but also a secret history of our time.<br /><br />Moving from the back alleys of Prague to the heart of Los Angeles, from the high deserts of Arizona to a guarded research facility in New York, The Traveler explores a parallel world that exists alongside our own.

One apartment had 37 rooms, 14 bathrooms, 43 closets, 11 working fireplaces, a private elevator, and his-and-hers saunas; another at one time had a live-in service staff of 16. To this day, it is steeped in the purest luxury, the kind most of us could only imagine, until now. <br /><br />The last great building to go up along New York’s Gold Coast, construction on 740 Park finished in 1930. Since then, 740 has been home to an ever-evolving cadre of our wealthiest and most powerful families, some of America’s (and the world’s) oldest money—the kind attached to names like Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Bouvier, Chrysler, Niarchos, Houghton, and Harkness—and some whose names evoke the excesses of today’s monied elite: Kravis, Koch, Bronfman, Perelman, Steinberg, and Schwarzman. All along, the building has housed titans of industry, political power brokers, international royalty, fabulous scam-artists, and even the lowest scoundrels.<br /><br />The book begins with the tumultuous story of the building’s construction. Conceived in the bubbling financial, artistic, and social cauldron of 1920’s Manhattan, 740 Park rose to its dizzying heights as the stock market plunged in 1929—the building was in dire financial straits before the first apartments were sold. The builders include the architectural genius Rosario Candela, the scheming businessman James T. Lee (Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis’s grandfather), and a raft of financiers, many of whom were little more than white-collar crooks and grand-scale hustlers. <br /><br />Once finished, 740 became a magnet for the richest, oldest families in the country: the Brewsters, descendents of the leader of the Plymouth Colony; the socially-registered Bordens, Hoppins, Scovilles, Thornes, and Schermerhorns; and top executives of the Chase Bank, American Express, and U.S. Rubber. Outside the walls of 740 Park, these were the people shaping America culturally and economically. Within those walls, they were indulging in all of the Seven Deadly Sins. <br /><br />As the social climate evolved throughout the last century, so did 740 Park: after World War II, the building’s rulers eased their more restrictive policies and began allowing Jews (though not to this day African Americans) to reside within their hallowed walls. Nowadays, it is full to bursting with new money, people whose fortunes, though freshly-made, are large enough to buy their way in. <br /><br />At its core this book is a social history of the American rich, and how the locus of power and influence has shifted haltingly from old bloodlines to new money. But it’s also much more than that: filled with meaty, startling, often tragic stories of the people who lived behind 740’s walls, the book gives us an unprecedented access to worlds of wealth, privilege, and extraordinary folly that are usually hidden behind a scrim of money and influence. This is, truly, how the other half—or at least the other one hundredth of one percent—lives.",3.32,576,Paperback, ,100,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80878.740_Park,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/80878.740_Park

Ahmad Shamlu (1925-2000) is among the most celebrated literary figures ofcontemporary Iranian literature. The poems presented here, capture Shamlu's unique depictions of love. The narrator in these poems is a man intoxicated by the love of a woman; a woman whom we meet in the body of his love poetry; a female presentation whose characteristics are not fixed. Due to Shamlu's widely recognized prominence within the intellectual opposition, the mainstream approach to his poetry has largely evaluated it in terms of the socio-political background of the poet's era. Taking issue with this limiting approach, the present work emphasizes an alternative reading of Shamlu, based on a primarily aesthetic analysis of the theme of aphrodisiac love in his poetry.

The present edition features the impeccable translation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Richard Howard. In spirited dialogue with his bigoted, boorish interviewer, <i>Corydon</i> marshals evidence from naturalists, historians, poets, and philosophers to support his contention that homosexuality pervaded the most culturally and artistically advanced civilizations, from Greece in the age of Pericles to Renaissance Italy and England in the age of Shakespeare. Although obscured by later critics, literature and art from Homer to Titian proclaim the true nature of relationships between such lovers as Achilles and Patrocles—not to mention Virgil's mythical Corydon and his shepherd, Alexis, constructed union, while the more fundamental, natural relation is the homosexual one. ""My friends insist that this little book is of the kind which will do me the greatest harm,"" Gide wrote of his <i>Corydon</i>.

No one -- not aspiring actor Rusty Godowski, not his girlfriend, Mary-Ann Pringle, not powerful agent Letitia Van Allen -- remains untouched by Myra's quest. Her job teaching Empathy and Posture at the Academy of Drama and Modeling, owned by her uncle Buck Loner, gives her the perfect opportunity to vamp, scheme, and seduce her way into the undiscovered lives and passions of others -- while trying to keep a few secrets of her own.In the sequel, Myron, the Breckinridge saga takes an increasingly bizarre turn. Myron seems to be an inconspicuous man with a sweet wife and a Chinese catering business, and Myra, determined to become a megastar, wages an outrageous battle for hormonal supremacy over the body she shares with Myron. In a tale that combines time-travel with the ultimate Hollywood fantasy, Gore Vidal leads us through the movie-star world of the fabulous forties as Myra attempts to alter cinema history.When Myra Breckinridge first appeared in 1968, critics were delighted, baffled, and somewhat appalled by this comedy of sex change.

From their conversation emerges a series of subtle reflections on gender roles, sex in society and the sublimation of basic human instincts. The discussion culminates in a radical challenge to conventional views by Plato's mentor, Socrates, who advocates transcendence through spiritual love. The Symposium is a deft interweaving of different viewpoints and ideas about the nature of love--as a response to beauty, a cosmic force, a motive for social action and as a means of ethical education.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

More than an ambitious and successful effort to preserve the rich heritage of his native land, this volume confirms Yeats's conviction that imagination is the source of both life and art.

It is the first of four connected plays--including <em>1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV</em>, and <em>Henry V</em>--generally considered Shakespeare's finest history plays. <br /> The drama of <em>Richard II</em> centers on the power struggle between the grandiloquent King Richard and the plain-spoken, blunt Henry Bolingbroke, who is banished from Britain at the beginning of the play. But when Henry's father John of Gaunt dies, Richard confiscates his property with no regard to his son's rights, and Bolingbroke returns to confront the king, who surrenders his crown and is imprisoned in Pomfret Castle, where he is soon murdered. This new edition in the acclaimed Oxford Shakespeare series features a freshly edited version of the text. The wide-ranging introduction describes the play's historical circumstances, both the period that it dramatizes (the start of the ""wars of the roses"") and the period in which it was written (late Elizabethan England), and the play's political significance in its own time and our own. It also focuses on the play's richly poetic language and its success over the centuries as a play for the stage.

The unbridled enthusiasm of their flamboyant grandmother Lola was the glue that held them together. As adults, though, the women haven't spoken in years - ever since Bett's fiance deserted her to marry the younger Carrie. Now Lola is turning eighty and she is determined to reunite the girls for a blowout bash. And no one ever says no to Lola.<br /><br />Bett, who fled to London after the scandal of losing her fiance, is hesitant to face her sisters and her hometown - especially since she has yet to find another man. Sophisticated Anna, the eldest sister, isn't too keen on the prospect either, though she's secretly grateful for any excuse to leave her crumbling marriage behind in Sydney. And Carrie, who remained in Clare Valley, is perhaps the most apprehensive. Her marriage - the nominal cause of the sisters' estrangement - is also on the rocks. Was she wrong to have followed her heart and run off with Bett's fiance?<br /><br />When Lola shares her special request, that the girls stage a musical she has written, their short visit becomes a much longer commitment. As they are forced to spend more time together, the sisters must confront the pain that lingers between them.

  <br />
</b>In an engaging combination of dialogues, reflections, conversations, history, and travel information, Kyriacos C. Markides continues the exploration of a spiritual tradition and practice little known in the West he began in <i>Riding with the Lion</i>. His earlier book took readers to the isolated peninsula of Mount Athos in northern Greece and into the group of ancient monasteries. There, in what might be called a ""Christian Tibet,"" two thousand monks and hermits practice the spiritual arts to attain a oneness with God. In his new book, Markides follows Father Maximos, one of Mount Athos's monks, to the troubled island of Cyprus. As Father Maximos establishes churches, convents, and monasteries in this deeply divided land, Markides is awakened anew to the magnificent spirituality of the Greek Orthodox Church.<br /><br />Images of the land and the people of Cyprus and details of its tragic history enrich the Mountain of Silence. Like the writings of Castaneda, the book brilliantly evokes the confluence of an inner and outer journey. The depth and richness of its spiritual message echo the thoughts and writings of Saint Francis of Assisi and other great saints of the Church as well.

Within the space of two months in 1947 more than twelve million people were displaced. A million died. More than seventy-five thousand women were abducted and raped. Countless children disappeared. Homes, villages, communities, families, and relationships were destroyed. Yet, more than half a century later, little is known of the human dimensions of this event. <br /><br />In <i>The Other Side of Silence</i> , Urvashi Butalia fills this gap by placing people—their individual experiences, their private pain—at the center of this epochal event.Through interviews conducted over a ten-year period and an examination of diaries, letters, memoirs, and parliamentary documents, Butalia asks how people on the margins of history—children, women, ordinary people, the lower castes, the untouchables—have been affected by this upheaval. <br /><br />To understand how and why certain events become shrouded in silence, she traces facets of her own poignant and partition-scarred family history before investigating the stories of other people and their experiences of the effects of this violent disruption. Those whom she interviews reveal that, at least in private, the voices of partition have not been stilled and the bitterness remains. <br /><br />Throughout, Butalia reflects on difficult questions: what did community, caste, and gender have to do with the violence that accompanied partition? What was partition meant to achieve and what did it actually achieve? How, through unspeakable horrors, did the survivors go on? Believing that only by remembering and telling their stories can those affected begin the process of healing and forgetting, Butalia presents a sensitive and moving account of her quest to hear the painful truth behind the silence.",4.02,328,Paperback, ,58,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83007.The_Other_Side_of_Silence,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83007.The_Other_Side_of_Silence

Dos de ellos, Yumira y El cristantemo en la roca, fueron incluidos posteriormente en una antología de sus cuentos favoritos que se publicó poco después de que recibiera el Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1968. Esta antología es una fina muestra de la grandeza de Kawabata. En los pequeños mundos de trazos delicados que se abren con cada cuento, en medio de sus resonancias y su luminosidad, descubrimos siempre la inteligencia inquisitiva y el humor de uno de los grandes del siglo XX. <br /><br />Although he was the first Japanese writer to win the Nobel Prize, Yasunari Kawabata (1899-1972) remains much more obscure in the West than his high-profile protégé Yukio Mishima. Yet he's a writer of formidable talents. For one thing, Kawabata recognized early on the affinity between Japanese poetry--with its abrupt transition from image to image--and the jump-cut flavor of modernist prose. He also explored erotic life at a truly microcosmic level. Some may find a novel like <i>The Mole</i>--which revolves around a woman's habit of fiddling with her eponymous birthmark--a little <i>too</i> molecular in its approach. But sex, like God, is in the details, and throughout his career Kawabata has unearthed some surprising truths about our most urgent appetites.<p> <i>First Snow on Fuji</i>, a collection of stories originally published in 1958, is a fairly representative slice of the author's oeuvre. In ""Her Husband Didn't"" (a classic Kawabata title, by the way), a woman's earlobe becomes the discreet object of desire: </p><blockquote> The earlobe was just as round and plump as an earlobe ought to be--it was small enough that Junji could squeeze it between the tips of his thumb and forefinger, no bigger than that--yet it filled him with a sense of the beauty of life. The smooth skin, the gentle swelling--the woman's earlobe was like a mysterious jewel.... He had never known anything with a texture like this. It was like touching the lovely girl's soul. </blockquote> For Kawabata's characters, the physical usually leads straight to the metaphysical, which is what prevents him from deteriorating into a soft-core thrill merchant. And in several of the other stories here, he proceeds directly to the weightier issues. ""Silence,"" for example, is at once a study in failing inspiration and a gloss on Kawabata's own career (the latter argument is made very effectively by translator Michael Emmerich in his introduction). And the title story offers an intriguing take on memory, which Kawabata seems to regard as a distinctly feminine operation: it's ""the docility of women that makes it possible for them to return to the past.""<p> What we love most in a writer--the idiosyncratic music of his or her prose--is the hardest thing for a translator to capture. There are times, alas, when Emmerich's ear seems inadequate to the task. His rendering never falls beneath a certain literate level--but for a writer of Kawabata's minimalistic delicacy, a clunky transition or flatfooted phrase can sink the whole enterprise. Readers might prefer to start, then, with <i>Thousand Cranes</i> or <i>Snow Country</i>. But for all its linguistic flaws, <i>First Snow on Fuji</i> reminds us that in literature most of all, less can be more--much more. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>",3.83,238,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83025.Primera_nieve_en_el_monte_Fuji,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83025.Primera_nieve_en_el_monte_Fuji

But if Jackie had lived to see her son, JFK Jr., perish in a plane crash on his way to his cousin's wedding, she would have been doubly horrified by the familiar pattern in the tragedy. Once again, on a day that should have been full of joy and celebration, America's first family was struck by the Kennedy Curse.<br /><br />In this probing expose, renowned Kennedy biographer Edward Klein-a bestselling author and journalist personally acquainted with many members of the Kennedy family-unravels one of the great mysteries of our time and explains why the Kennedys have been subjected to such a mind-boggling chain of calamities.<br /><br />Drawing upon scores of interviews with people who have never spoken out before, troves of private documents, archives in Ireland and America, and private conversations with Jackie, Klein explores the underlying pattern that governs the Kennedy Curse.<br /><br />The reader is treated to penetrating portraits of the Irish immigrant Patrick Kennedy; Rose Kennedy's father, ""Honey Fitz""; the dynasty's founding father Joe Kennedy and his ill-fated daughter Kathleen, President Kennedy, accused rapist William Kennedy Smith, and the star-crossed lovers, JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette.

The debate has raged up to the present day. Yet Liebow's shadow theory of values-especially the values of poor, urban, black men-remains the single most parsimonious account of the reasons why the behavior of the poor appears to be at odds with the values of the American mainstream. While Elliot Liebow's vivid narrative of ""street-corner"" black men remains unchanged, the new introductions to this long-awaited revised edition bring the book up to date. Wilson and Lemert describe the debates since 1965 and situate Liebow's classic text in respect to current theories of urban poverty and race. They account for what Liebow might have seen had he studied the street corner today after welfare has been virtually ended and the drug economy had taken its toll. They also take stock of how the new global economy is a source of added strain on the urban poor.

Touba is granted a divorce from him, and lives out the rest of her long life as matriarch to a changing household of family members and refugees.<br /><br />From a distinctly Iranian viewpoint, <i>Tuba and the Meaning of Night</i> explores the ongoing tensions between rationalism and mysticism, tradition and modernity, male dominance and female will. Throughout, it defies Western stereotypes of Iranian women and Western expectations of literary form, speaking in an idiom that reflects both the unique creative voice of its author and an important tradition in Persian women's writing.",3.56,320,Hardcover, ,28,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83202.Touba_and_the_Meaning_of_Night,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83202.Touba_and_the_Meaning_of_Night

Its setting is the Persian Gulf Coast--an area geographically isolated from the rest of Iran and influenced by the customs, rituals, and superstitions of Black Africa, India, and Arabia.<br />The episodes, occurring in and around a primitive village, are mostly symbolic and allegorical. In the harsh, cheerless environment of the Gulf, the sea, the sky, the sun and the moon appear ominous and full of foreboding. Elusive fears lurk in the villagers' paths, threatening their precarious peace and safety.<br />In spite of its distant setting and allegorical mode, however, the novel deals with contemporary issues in Iranian politics. In particular, it prophetically warns its readers against sheepish submission to self-aggrandizing clergy (Section Two), as it cautions against blind surrender to the West (Section Six)--warnings that the people of Iran would have done well to heed.<br />A detailed critical introduction and bibliography also place Sa'edi in his cultural/literary context, and offer readers leads to further reading and study of this seminal writer.",3.86,121,Paperback, ,29,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83215.Fear_and_Trembling,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83215.Fear_and_Trembling

The adventures of Alice-named for one of the little girls to whom the book was dedicated-who journeys down a rabbit hole and into a whimsical underworld realm instantly struck a chord with the British public, and then with readers around the world. In 1872, in reaction to the universal acclaim *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* received, Dodgson published this sequel. Nothing is quite what it seems once Alice journeys through the looking-glass, and Dodgson's wit is infectious as he explores concepts of mirror imagery, time running backward, and strategies of chess-all wrapped up in the exploits of a spirited young girl who parries with the Red Queen, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and other unlikely characters.

Transcribed from Stephen Hawking's Cambridge Lectures, the slim volume may not present a single theory unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces, but it does carefully explain the state of late 20th-century physics with the great scientist's characteristic humility and charm. Explicitly shunning math, Hawking explains the fruits of 100 years of heavy thinking with metaphors that are simple but never condescending--he compares the settling of the newborn universe into symmetry to the formation of ice crystals in a glass of water, for example. While he explores his own work (especially when speaking about black holes), he also discusses the important milestones achieved by others like Richard Feynman. Though occasionally an impenetrably obscure phrase does slip by, the reader will find the bulk of the text enlightening and engaging. The material, from the nature of time to the possibility that the universe has no beginning or end, is rich and deep and inevitably ignites metaphysical thinking. After all, Hawking is famous for his ""we would know the mind of God"" remark, which ends the final lecture herein. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>",4.17,0,Audio CD, ,6,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83719.The_Theory_of_Everything,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83719.The_Theory_of_Everything

By establishing a solid foundation, adhering to fundamentals and demanding an uncommon toughness from his players, Alvarez became the architect of three Rose Bowl triumphs in the ?90s and became the school's all-time winningest football coach. While changing the culture of the sport on the Madison campus, raising expectations to heretofore unthinkable levels, Alvarez left an indelible mark on the Badgers during his 16 seasons on the sidelines. Not only did Alvarez take over a Big Ten footwipe and build the program into national prominence, but he sustained the success by sticking to a plan rooted to his upbringing in Western Pennyslvania and his exposure to three legendary coaches, Nebraska's Bob Devaney, Iowa's Hayden Fry and Notre Dame's Lou Holtz. In his autobiography ? Don't Flinch ? Alvarez talks about the lessons that he learned from his mentors, the hurdles that he had to overcome as a young assistant and high school coach, and the challenge of taking over his own college program while living in a fishbowl, especially from his family's perspective. Alvarez maps out a strategy and game plan for young coaches who are seeking to achieve similar goals, and he also talks about his future as Wisconsin athletics director, and the future of college football. Alvarez's story, told in Alvarez's candid, pull-no-punches style, is written by Madison Capital Times columnist Mike Lucas, who also doubles as the color analyst for Badgerfootball and basketball on the UW radio network. Lucas, a Beloit native, enrolled at Wisconsin in 1968, and wrote for the Badger Herald and Daily Cardinal before joining the Capital Times as a full-time writer in 1971. Along with national, regional and local writing awards, Lucas has twice been named Sportswriter of the Year in Wisconsin. Lucas is entering his 12th season on the radio network.

For both the uninitiated, Chinese business negotiations in China may come as a culture shock, laced with frustration. For the experienced China trade negotiator, it is a never–ending learning process. For both parties, the secret to negotiating in China may well lie in the knowledge of the military ploys described in China's ancient classics. <br /><br />Drawing from the lessons of China's ancient military classic, Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i>, Laurence J.
