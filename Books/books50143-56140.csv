Yet there are moments of exquisite tenderness in these troubled lives. Georgette, the transvestite who falls in love with a callous hoodlum; Tralala, the conniving prostitute who plumbs the depths of sexual degradation; and Harry, the strike leader who hides his true desires behind a boorish masculinity, are unforgettable creations. <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i> was banned by British courts in 1967, a decision that was reversed the following year with the help of a number of writers and critics including Anthony Burgess and Frank Kermode.<br /><br />Hubert Selby, Jr. (1928-2004) was born in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 15, he dropped out of school and went to sea with the merchant marines. While at sea he was diagnosed with lung disease. With no other way to make a living, he decided to try writing: 'I knew the alphabet. Maybe I could be a writer.' In 1964 he completed his first book, <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i>, which has since become a cult classic. In 1966, it was the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK. His other books include <i>The Room</i>, <i>The Demon</i>, <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>, <i>The Willow Tree</i> and <i>Waiting Period</i>. In 2000, <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> was adapted into a film starring Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, and directed by Darren Aronofsky.<br /><br />'<i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i> will explode like a rusty hellish bombshell over America, and still be eagerly read in 100 years'<br /><i>Allen Ginsberg</i><br /><br />'An urgent tickertape from hell'<br /><i>Spectator</i>",3.84,290,Paperback, ,883,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50275.Last_Exit_to_Brooklyn,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50275.Last_Exit_to_Brooklyn

The chief figure among the Beats, Ginsberg changed the course of American poetry, liberating it from closed academic forms with the creation of open, vocal, spontaneous, and energetic postmodern verse in the tradition of Walt Whitman, Guillaume Apollinaire, Hart Crane, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg's classics <em>Howl, Reality Sandwiches, Kaddish, Planet News,</em> and <em>The Fall of America</em> led American (and international) poetry toward uncensored vernacular, explicit candor, the ecstatic, the rhapsodic, and the sincere—all leavened by an attractive and pervasive streak of common sense. Ginsberg's raw tones and attitudes of spiritual liberation also helped catalyze a psychological revolution that has become a permanent part of our cultural heritage, profoundly influencing not only poetry and popular song and speech, but also our view of the world.<br /><br />The uninterrupted energy of Ginsberg's remarkable career is clearly revealed in this collection. Seen in order of composition, the poems reflect on one another; they are not only works but also a work. Included here are all the poems from the earlier volume <em>Collected Poems 1947-1980</em>, and from Ginsberg's subsequent and final three books of new poetry: <em>White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death &amp; Fame</em>. Enriching this book are illustrations by Ginsberg's artist friends; unusual and illuminating notes to the poems, inimitably prepared by the poet himself; extensive indexes; as well as prefaces and various other materials that accompanied the original publications.",4.35,1216,Hardcover,First Edition,54,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50316.Collected_Poems_1947_1997,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50316.Collected_Poems_1947_1997

He was brought up in India in the apparently vigorous but dying Raj and was sent by his family in the 1930s to Berlin -- though he could not speak a word of German -- to study medicine and dentistry. It was here, before he migrated to Britain, that Shanti's path first crossed that of his future wife. <br /><br />Helga Gerda Caro, known to everyone as ""Henny"" was also born in 1908, in Berlin, to a Jewish family -- cultured, patriotic, and intensely German. When the family decided to take Shanti as a lodger, Henny's first reaction was, ""Don't take the black man!""

Se dice que un tal Céline, que merodea por las librerías inspeccionando a la competencia y buscando primeras ediciones de Faulkner, sería nada más ni nada menos que Louis Ferdinand, que no habría muerto en 1961 en Meudon. Nick Belane, un detective privado muy poco intelectual, es el encargado de averiguar la verdad. ¿Y quién quiere saberla? Una dama muy fatal, quizá la más fatal de todas, que no acepta que Céline pudiera haber escapado a su mortal encanto. Pero de repente la temporada de trabajo se ha vuelto muy buena para Nick y tiene varios asuntos más entre manos: encontrar el Gorrión Rojo, que no es el nieto del Halcón Maltés para un tal John Barton, y descubrir si Cindy, la mujer de Jack Bass, engaña a su marido. Pero, como ya demostró cumplidamente Raymond Chandler, todos los casos de un detective siempre se lían entre sí, y entre Cindy y Céline se organizará un lío considerable. ""Pulp"", la última novela de Bukowski, es una parodia y un homenaje a todas las «pulp fictions» que sobre el papel han sido, y una real, literaria y sangrante «pulp fiction» por derecho propio, que recurre a la tragedia y al humor, a la literatura y a claves de la más pura y dura realidad, a lo real y a lo surreal.",3.68,200,Paperback,Colección Compactos #156,47,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50454.Pulp,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50454.Pulp

By now, many legends surround Cornell: that of the painfully shy hermit lost in a world of books, silent movies, and long-gone ballerinas; that of the patiently devoted caretaker who would rush home from an afternoon at the Manhattan galleries to minister to his mother and invalid brother; that of the artistic innocent whose creations emerged as happy accidents from his hands. Yet Cornell and his work were cherished by the leading avant-garde figures of his day, and artists who agreed on little else agreed on Cornell's originality. Utopia Parkway - the product of Deborah Solomon's decade of sustained attention to Cornell, and the first serious biography of him - reveals him as a brilliant and relentlessly serious artist whose works are among the monuments of modern art. Admired by successive generations of vanguard artists - the Surrealists of the 1940s, tbe Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s the Pop artists of the 1960s - Cornell cultivated friendships with artists as diverse as Marcel Duchamp, Willem de Kooning, and Andy Warhol. He had romantically charged encounters with women, including Tamara Toumanova, Susan Sontag, and Yoko Ono, and unrequited crushes on anonymous waitresses and shop girls. All this he recorded compulsively in a diary, which stands with the boxes themselves as a strange and affecting record of his extravagant inner life.",4.08,426,Hardcover, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50721.Utopia_Parkway,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50721.Utopia_Parkway

The line isn’t moving. You’re angry at the security personnel for taking so long, you’re irritated at the other passengers for having so much stuff, you’re mad at your boss for sending you on this trip in the first place. By the time you get to your gate you’re angry, deflated, and exhausted. Then someone cuts in front of you in the line to board and you snap. “There’s a line, you know!” Is that really you, standing in an airport, yelling at a stranger, emotions raging? <br /><br />It happens to most of us more than we’d like to admit. In an instant, our lives seem out of control and overwhelming. It’s always something, isn’t it? But what if you could approach every part of your life—from the smallest decisions to life’s biggest setbacks—with total confidence, clarity, and control? <br /><br />According to Sakyong Mipham, we all have that power. The secret is simple: If you just stop thinking about yourself all the time, happiness and confidence will come naturally. It sounds absurd and, what’s more, impossible. But in<i> Ruling Your World</i>, Sakyong Mipham shares ancient secrets on how to take control of our lives and be successful while cultivating compassion for others and confidence in our own intelligence and goodness. The key to this well-being lies in the ancient strategies of the warrior kings and queens of Shambhala. <br /><br />The kingdom of Shambhala was an enlightened kingdom of benevolent kings and queens and fiercely trained warriors. No one knows for sure whether this kingdom was real or mythical, but there are ancient guidebooks to this land and practical instructions for creating a Shambhala in your own world, bringing peace, purpose, and perspective into your life and environment. <br /><br />Sakyong Mipham, the descendant of a warrior king, has inherited these teachings and gives us the lessons and myths of the great rulers and warriors of Shambhala. He makes these teachings relevant to our twenty-first-century lives in a fresh and witty voice and helps us all to realize our potential for power and control in a seemingly uncontrollable world.<br /><br />For the first time ever, revered spiritual leader Sakyong Mipham brings the lessons of the ancient Shambhala warriors and rulers to the Western world and shows us how to live our lives with confidence. <br /><br /><br /><i>Most of us are living in a haze—sometimes helping others, sometimes helping ourselves, sometimes happy, sometimes sad. We don’t feel in control of our own lives. The ancient teachings of Shambhala rulership show us that we all have the ability to rule our own world and live with confidence. To do this, we need to use our daily lives to be strong, as opposed to aggressive, and to act with wisdom and compassion. This may sound difficult, but when we begin to mix this ancient wisdom of rulership into our everyday life, we have both spiritual and worldly success.

Yet those wind-torn hours represented only the first stage of the relentless triple tragedy that Katrina brought to the entire Gulf Coast, from Louisiana to Mississippi to Alabama.<br /><br />First came the hurricane, one of the three strongest ever to make landfall in the United States -- 150-mile-per-hour winds, with gusts measuring more than 180 miles per hour ripping buildings to pieces.<br /><br />Second, the storm-surge flooding, which submerged a half million homes, creating the largest domestic refugee crisis since the Civil War. Eighty percent of New Orleans was under water, as debris and sewage coursed through the streets, and whole towns in south-eastern Louisiana ceased to exist.<br /><br />And third, the human tragedy of government mis-management, which proved as cruel as the natural disaster itself. Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans, implemented an evacuation plan that favored the rich and healthy. Kathleen Blanco, governor of Louisiana, dithered in the most important aspect of her job: providing leadership in a time of fear and confusion. Michael C. Brown, the FEMA director, seemed more concerned with his sartorial splendor than the specter of death and horror that was taking New Orleans into its grip.<br /><br />In <em>The Great Deluge</em>, bestselling author Douglas Brinkley, a New Orleans resident and professor of history at Tulane University, rips the story of Katrina apart and relates what the Category 3 hurricane was like from every point of view. The book finds the true heroes -- such as Coast Guard officer Jimmy Duckworth and hurricane jock Tony Zumbado.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Brinkley lets the Katrina survivors tell their own stories, masterly allowing them to record the nightmare that was Katrina. <em>The Great Deluge</em> investigates the failure of government at every level and breaks important new stories. Packed with interviews and original research, it traces the character flaws, inexperience, and ulterior motives that allowed the Katrina disaster to devastate the Gulf Coast.",4.16,736,Hardcover, ,276,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51029.The_Great_Deluge,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51029.The_Great_Deluge

It's no surprise that as a kid in the '80s, Wilsey found similarities between his own life and his beloved <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>--his journey was fraught with unnerving characters too. <p> Wilsey's father was a distant, wealthy man who used a helicopter when a moped would do and whose mandates included squeegeeing the stall after every shower. Much of Wilsey's youth was spent as subservient to, or rebelling against this imposing man. But the maternal figures in Wilsey's childhood were no less affecting. His mother, a San Francisco society butterfly turned globe-trotting peace promoter, seemed to behave only in extremes--either trying to convince young Sean to commit suicide with her, or arranging impromptu meetings with the Pope and Mikhail Gorbachev. And Dede, his demon of a stepmother, would have made the Brothers Grimm shiver. </p><p> As always with memoirs one must take expansive sections of recalled dialogue with a grain of salt, but Wilsey's short, unflinching sentences keep his outlandish story moving too quickly for much quibbling. In the end, Wilsey says, ""It took the unlikely combination of the three of them--mother, father, stepmother--to make me who I am."" It's a fairly basic conclusion after 479 pages of turning every stone, but it's also one that renders his story--more than shocking or glorious--human. <i>--Brangien Davis</i></p>",3.61,482,Paperback, ,394,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51296.Oh_the_Glory_of_it_All,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51296.Oh_the_Glory_of_it_All

The answer is a resounding yes. In late 2004, leading Western scientists joined the Dalai Lama at his home in Dharamsala, India, to address this very question–and in the process brought about a revolution in our understanding of the human mind. In this fascinating and far-reaching book, Wall Street Journal science writer Sharon Begley reports on how cutting-edge science and the ancient wisdom of Buddhism have come together to show how we all have the power to literally change our brains by changing our minds. These findings hold exciting implications for personal transformation.<br /><br />For decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the hardware of the brain is fixed and immutable–that we are stuck with what we were born with. As Begley shows, however, recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity, a new science that investigates whether and how the brain can undergo wholesale change, reveal that the brain is capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new neurons, even into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma, and compensate for disability. <br /><br />Begley documents how this fundamental paradigm shift is transforming both our understanding of the human mind and our approach to deep-seated emotional, cognitive, and behavioral problems. These breakthroughs show that it is possible to reset our happiness meter, regain the use of limbs disabled by stroke, train the mind to break cycles of depression and OCD, and reverse age-related changes in the brain. They also suggest that it is possible to teach and learn compassion, a key step in the Dalai Lama’s quest for a more peaceful world. But as we learn from studies performed on Buddhist monks, an important component in changing the brain is to tap the power of mind and, in particular, focused attention. This is the classic Buddhist practice of mindfulness, a technique that has become popular in the West and that is immediately available to everyone. <br /><br />With her extraordinary gift for making science accessible, meaningful, and compelling, Sharon Begley illuminates a profound shift in our understanding of how the brain and the mind interact. This tremendously hopeful book takes us to the leading edge of a revolution in what it means to be human.",4.01,304,Hardcover, ,111,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51368.Train_Your_Mind_Change_Your_Brain,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51368.Train_Your_Mind_Change_Your_Brain

Rutherfurd spins the saga of Ireland’s 400-year path to independence in all its drama, tragedy, and glory through the stories of people from all strata of society--Protestant and Catholic, rich and poor, conniving and heroic. <br /> <br />His richly detailed narrative brings to life watershed moments and events, from the time of plantation settlements to the “Flight of the Earls,” when the native aristocracy fled the island, to Cromwell’s suppression of the population and the imposition of the harsh anti-Catholic penal laws. He describes the hardships of ordinary people and the romantic, doomed attempt to overthrow the Protestant oppressors, which ended in defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and the departure of the “Wild Geese.” In vivid tones Rutherfurd re-creates Grattan’s Parliament, Wolfe Tone's attempted French invasion of 1798, the tragic rising of Robert Emmet, the Catholic campaign of Daniel O’Connell, the catastrophic famine, the mass migration to America, and the glorious Irish Renaissance of Yeats and Joyce. And through the eyes of his characters, he captures the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the great Irish nationalists and the birth of an Ireland free of all ties to England. <br /> <br />A tale of fierce battles, hot-blooded romances, and family and political intrigues, <i>The Rebels of Ireland</i> brings the story begun in <i>The Princes of Ireland</i> to a stunning conclusion.",4.09,863,Paperback, ,341,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51433.The_Rebels_of_Ireland,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51433.The_Rebels_of_Ireland

Tommy was distant, transfixed by video games and pop culture, and a mystery to the man who raised him. Now, disabled by the accident, yearning somehow to absolve his own guilt over the crash, Jim becomes obsessed with a mysterious building Tommy drew repetitively in a notebook before he died.

She first became interested in politics in the revolutionary circles of late-nineteenth century St. Petersburg. Then, on emigration to the United States, this daughter of a poor, Russian-Jewish family threw herself into political agitation on behalf of a host of radical causes, from free love to birth control to anarchism. At a time when women only rarely participated in public life, she was a highly visible exception, drawing crowds - and the attention of the police - wherever she went. In addition to her political activities, she played an important role in introducing the most advanced European thought and literature to an American public. Jailed for agitating against American entry into World War I, she was deported to the newly-born Soviet Union in 1919. There, she worked on behalf of the Bolshevik government, but soon became disillusioned with the Soviet state, which she came to see as a nascent tyranny. Fleeing that country, she spent the rest of her life wandering, a permanent exile ""nowhere at home. "" During Goldman's later life, and especially after her death, her reputation went into a temporary eclipse. As the social upheavals of the earlier part of the century faded from memory and as the anarchist movement declined, she came to seem a colorful but irrelevant figure of an increasingly distant past. With the onset of a new wave of political discontent in the 1960s, however, Goldman was once again a subject of scholarly and popular interest. Her writings were reissued; her image was often displayed on wall posters and picket signs; her name and example were frequently invoked by the activists of the period. Indeed, for the feminists and radicals of the 1960s and 70s, Emma Goldman achieved the status of an icon, the very symbol of personal and political liberation.",3.80,183,Paperback, ,0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51713.Emma_Goldman_and_the_American_Left,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51713.Emma_Goldman_and_the_American_Left

The unstated objective of his lecture (“Existentialism Is a Humanism”) was to expound his philosophy as a form of “existentialism,” a term much bandied about at the time. Sartre asserted that existentialism was essentially a doctrine for philosophers, though, ironically, he was about to make it accessible to a general audience. The published text of his lecture quickly became one of the bibles of existentialism and made Sartre an international celebrity.<br /><br />The idea of freedom occupies the center of Sartre’s doctrine. Man, born into an empty, godless universe, is nothing to begin with. He creates his essence—his self, his being—through the choices he freely makes (“existence precedes essence”). Were it not for the contingency of his death, he would never end. Choosing to be this or that is to affirm the value of what we choose. In choosing, therefore, we commit not only ourselves but all of mankind.<br /><br />This book presents a new English translation of Sartre’s 1945 lecture and his analysis of Camus’s <em>The Stranger</em>, along with a discussion of these works by acclaimed Sartre biographer Annie Cohen-Solal.

For this occasion the University of Pennsylvania Press will publish a special edition of Franklin's <i>Autobiography</i>, including a new preface by University president Amy Gutmann and an introduction by distinguished scholar Peter Conn. The volume will also include four short essays by noted Penn professors as well as a chronology of Franklin's life and the text of Franklin's <i>Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania</i>, a document resulting in the establishment of an institution of higher education that ultimately became the University of Pennsylvania.<br /><br />No area of human endeavor escaped Franklin's keen attentions.

Sheriff Fred Clumly is trying desperately to unravel mysteries surrounding a disorderly, nameless drifter called ""The Sunlight Man,"" who has been jailed for painting the word ""LOVE"" across two lanes of traffic, and who is later suspected of murder.

It is also home to the Boatwright family - rough-hewn men who drink hard and shoot up each other's trucks, and indomitable women who marry young and age all too quickly. At the heart of this memorable family - and of this astonishing novel - is Ruth Anne Boatwright, called Bone by her family, a South Carolina bastard with an annotated birth certificate to tell the tale.<br /><br />Bone knows what Greenville County thinks os her family, and when she's not defending them passionately, she has to agree: Boatwrights are drunks and thieves, and she'd like nothing more than to escape the life they would make for her. Observing everything with a mercifully keen eye, Bone sees the legacy of poverty and futility that marks her family's place in this small southern town - the fierce pride that erupts in rage and violence; the women who ward off loneliness by having more children; the desperation of itinerant souls who scarcely dare to dream of a better life.<br /><br />Bone dreams. She dreams of becoming a gospel singer (despite the fact that she can barely carry a tune), or of living a life out of one of the books she steals from the local library. She dreams of a life not only beyond Greenville but also away from Daddy Glen, the stepfather whose tenderness quickly gives way to a sly, meanspirited jealously that will test the loyalty of her mother, Anney. The edges of this family triangle are sharp enough to draw blood: Glen calls Bone ""cold as death, mean as a snake, and twice as twisty,"" yet Anney needs Glen ""like a strong woman needs meat between her teeth."" At first infinitely gentle with Bone, Daddy Glen becomes steadily colder and more furious - until their final, harrowing encounter, from which there can be no turning back.<br /><br />Written in a mesmerizing voice that mingles the languid rhythms of country music with raw, unsparing descriptions of emotional and physical violence, <i>Bastard out of Carolina</i> marks the emergence of an extraordinarily gifted writer.",4.12,309,Hardcover, ,110,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52663.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52663.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina

Brimming with amusing anecdotes and provocative problems, <i>One Two Three . . . </i><i>Infinity </i>also includes over 120 delightful pen-and-ink illustrations by the author, adding another dimension of good-natured charm to these wide-ranging explorations.<br />Whatever your level of scientific expertise, chances are you'll derive a great deal of pleasure, stimulation, and information from this unusual and imaginative book.

The hero, Etienne Gerard, is a Hussar officer in the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars. Gerard's most notable attribute is his vanity - he is utterly convinced that he is the bravest soldier, greatest swordsman, most accomplished horseman and most gallant lover in all France. Gerard is not entirely wrong, since he displays notable bravery on many occasions, but his self-satisfaction undercuts this quite often. Obsessed with honour and glory, he is always ready with a stirring speech or a gallant remark to a lady. Conan Doyle, in making his hero a vain, and often rather uncomprehending, Frenchman, was able to satirise both the stereotypical English view of the French and - by presenting them from Gerard's baffled point of view - English manners and attitudes.

That's one take on Frisco Pigeon Mambo, an uproarious new comic novel by C.D. Payne, author of the cult classic Youth in Revolt: The Journals of Nick Twisp.When a flock of alcohol- and tobacco-addicted lab pigeons are liberated in San Francisco, our feathered heroes turn the whole city topsy-turvy. They dance into bars, stick up liquor stores, spy on socialites, swipe a van full of cats, and even dodge a murder rap.<br /><br />Meet the leader who's convinced he's human because ""it would be too absurd to name a pigeon Robin"". Will Robin and his pals find their way back to Berkeley? Will they survive the next 15 minutes without a cigarette?<br /><br />Along the way, these swashbuckling outlaws team up with Freud-quoting parakeet on the lam from a mental health clinic, a pigeon-devouring falcon with a sudden interest in religion, a halibut-wielding sea gull with a knack for shoplifting, and more. Soon they have a price on their heads, cops on their trail, beer on their breath, and amour on their minds.<br /><br />Not since Hitchcock unleashed ""The Birds"" has California witnessed such mischief from the skies. But prepare for a surprise or two as the notorious ""Killer Pigeons"" undergo a dramatic transformation.<br /><br />Described by the author as ""America's great pigeon novel"", Frisco Pigeon Mambo is now in development as a Twentieth-Century Fox animated film, to be produced by the Farrelly brothers (""Something About Mary"", ""Me, Myself &amp; Irene""). Foreign rights to the novel have been sold so far to Germany (Droemer) and the Czech Republic (Jota).<br /><br />Frisco is being published simultaneously with Revolting Youth: The Further Journals of Nick Twisp.

There is Victor, who as a nine-year-old crawled between his unconscious parents hoping that the alcohol seeping through their skins might help him sleep.

He went everywhere when the going was good. He dabbled with surrealism in Paris in the 1930s, lived in the ""interzone"" of Tangier in the 1950s and traveled the Algerian Sahara with Sheltering Sky author Paul Bowles before moving into the legendary Beat Hotel in Paris.<br /><br />Gysin's ideas influenced generations of artists, musicians and writers, among them David Bowie, Keith Haring, Patti Smith, Michael Stipe, Genesis POrridge, John Giorno and Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones. None was touched more profoundly than William S.

It was Gysin who provided the hashish fudge recipe published in Alice B. Toklas' cookbook, promising ""ecstatic reveries and extensions of one's personality on several simultaneous planes."" It was Gysin who introduced Burroughs to an automatic writing method called the cutup, a literary progenitor to sampling.

Examining the history of death and of the death sign from the sixteenth-century holocaust to contemporary Mexican American identity politics, anthropologist Claudio Lomnitz's innovative study marks a turning point in understanding Mexico's rich and unique use of death imagery. Unlike contemporary Europeans and Americans, whose denial of death permeates their cultures, the Mexican people display and cultivate a jovial familiarity with death. This intimacy with death has become the cornerstone of Mexico's national identity.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is tempting to view this rich elaboration of death imagery as yet another example of an ""invented tradition,"" that is, a cult shaped by the modern state's cultural policies or by the narrow interests of contemporary identity politics. Lomnitz takes a different approach. Rather than flattening out the tradition by insisting only on the ways it is willfully manipulated, this book focuses on the dialectical relationship between dying, killing, and the administration of death, and the very formation of the colonial state, of a rich and variegated popular culture, and of the Mexican nation itself. The elevation of Mexican intimacy with death to the center of national identity is but a moment within that history -- within a history in which the key institutions of society are built around the claims of the fallen.<br /><br />Based on a wide range of sources -- from missionary testimonies to newspaper cartoons, from masterpieces of artistic vanguards to accounts of public executions and political assassinations -- <i>Death and the Idea of Mexico</i> moves beyond the limited methodology of traditional historiographies of death to probe the depths of a people and a country whose fearless acquaintance with death shapes the very terms of their social compact. This work effects a novel turn in the classical historiography of death -- a turn that can be characterized by a move from social and cultural history to political history. The move toward the politics of death gives readers a unique insight into the peculiar story of death in the Americas.",3.88,581,Hardcover, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52929.Death_and_the_Idea_of_Mexico,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52929.Death_and_the_Idea_of_Mexico

That time is the period between the two World Wars, and Barnes' novel unfolds in the decadent shadows of Europe's great cities, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna—a world in which the boundaries of class, religion, and sexuality are bold but surprisingly porous. The outsized characters who inhabit this world are some of the most memorable in all of fiction—there is Guido Volkbein, the Wandering Jew and son of a self-proclaimed baron; Robin Vote, the American expatriate who marries him and then engages in a series of affairs, first with Nora Flood and then with Jenny Petherbridge, driving all of her lovers to distraction with her passion for wandering alone in the night; and there is Dr. Matthew-Mighty-Grain-of-Salt-Dante-O'Connor, a transvestite and ostensible gynecologist, whose digressive speeches brim with fury, keen insights, and surprising allusions. Barnes' depiction of these characters and their relationships (Nora says, ""A man is another person—a woman is yourself, caught as you turn in panic; on her mouth you kiss your own"") has made the novel a landmark of feminist and lesbian literature. Most striking of all is Barnes' unparalleled stylistic innovation, which led T. S. Eliot to proclaim the book ""so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it.""

Rainer Maria Rilke was staying at Duino Castle, on a rocky headland of the Adriatic Sea near Trieste. One morning he walked out onto the battlements and climbed down to where the cliffs dropped sharply to the sea. From out of the fierce wind, Rilke seemed to hear a voice: <i>Wer, wenn ich schriee, horte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen?</i> (If I cried out, who would hear me up there, among the angelic orders?). He wrote these words, the opening of the first Duino Elegy, in his notebook, then went inside to continue what was to be his major opus—completely only after another ten, tormented years of effort—and one of the literary masterpieces of the century. <i>Duino Elegies</i> speaks in a voice that is both intimate and majestic on the mysteries of human life and our attempt, in the words of the translator David Young, “to use our self-consciousness to some advantage: to transcend, through art and the imagination, our self-deception and our fear.”",4.43,208,Paperback, ,145,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53111.Duino_Elegies,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53111.Duino_Elegies

He connects the alarming rise in autism, hyperkinetic behavior, childhood schizophrenia, and adolescent suicide to the all too common errors we make in raising and educating our children. Then he shows how we can restore the astonishing wealth of creative intelligence that is the brithright of every human being. Pearce challenged all our notions about child rearing, and in the process challenges us to re-examine ourselves. Pearce's message is simple: it is never too late to play, for we are all <b>Magical Children</b>.",4.11,272,Paperback, ,30,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53257.Magical_Child,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53257.Magical_Child

En ese examen de conciencia brillan a veces con potente luz los destellos de la infancia o las iluminaciones de los ideales juveniles, pero los poemas se centran en los borrones y claudicaciones, intimos y colectivos, que la historia inmediata le ha dejado en herencia. Son versos que nos hablan tambien del presente, del desajuste y las contradicciones que siente el poeta ante los nuevos tiempos y sus valores, y de la necesidad de conciliar convicciones y renuncias para concebir un destino soportable. La serpiente del árbol del bien y del mal se siente abandonada entre gentes que no quieren morder la manzana de los sueños. Como contrapunto a las composiciones de brillante reflexión civil, aparece otra serie de poemas más breves en los que el lenguaje se convierte en argumento primordial. Unos y otros demuestran, en cualquier caso, el arte de Garcia Montero para nombrar sentimientos complejos mediante objetos y escenas familiares, ese idioma dormido de las cosas y su apuesta por adentrarse en una expresión menos directa, donde la deslumbrante densidad de alusiones y sentidos sirve como nunca para relatar y relatarnos nuestra historia privada y colectiva.",3.83,144,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53370.La_intimidad_de_la_serpiente,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53370.La_intimidad_de_la_serpiente

He responds to all that life offers him with passion, whether he’s supervising laborers at a mine, confronting mad monks in a mountain monastery, embellishing the tales of his past adventures, or making love.

Gordon alone survived. And forgave. He said of the bombers, ' I have lost my daughter, but I bear no grudge . . . I shall pray, tonight and every night, that God will forgive them.' His words caught the media's ears  and out of one man's grief, the world got a glimpse of grace. Grace is the church's great distinctive. It's the one thing the world cannot duplicate, and the one thing it craves above all else  for only grace can bring hope and transformation to a jaded world. <p>In <cite>What's So Amazing About Grace?</cite> award-winning author Philip Yancey explores grace at street level. If grace is God's love for the undeserving, he asks, then what does it look like in action? And if Christians are its sole dispensers, then how are we doing at lavishing grace on a world that knows far more of cruelty and unforgiveness than it does of mercy? Yancey sets grace in the midst of life's stark images, tests its mettle against horrific 'ungrace.' Can grace survive in the midst of such atrocities as the Nazi holocaust? Can it triumph over the brutality of the Ku Klux Klan? Should any grace at all be shown to the likes of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed and cannibalized seventeen young men? Grace does not excuse sin, says Yancey, but it treasures the sinner. True grace is shocking, scandalous. It shakes our conventions with its insistence on getting close to sinners and touching them with mercy and hope. It forgives the unfaithful spouse, the racist, the child abuser. It loves today's AIDS-ridden addict as much as the tax collector of Jesus' day. </p><p>In his most personal and provocative book ever, Yancey offers compelling, true portraits of grace's life-changing power. He searches for its presence in his own life and in the church. He asks, How can Christians contend graciously with moral issues that threaten all they hold dear? And he challenges us to become living answers to a world that desperately wants to know, <cite>What's So Amazing About Grace?</cite></p>",4.16,304,Paperback,Original Cover Edition for ISBN 0310245656,897,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53817.What_s_So_Amazing_About_Grace_,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53817.What_s_So_Amazing_About_Grace_

This book is an invitation to communicate with God the Father who invites us into an eternal partnership through prayer.<br /><br />In his most powerful book since <i>What’s So Amazing About Grace?</i> and <i>The Jesus I Never Knew</i>, Philip Yancey probes the most fundamental, challenging, perplexing, and deeply rewarding aspect of our relationship with God: prayer. What is prayer? How does it work? And more importantly, does it work? In theory, prayer is the essential human act, a priceless point of contact between us and the God of the universe. In practice, prayer is often frustrating, confusing, and fraught with mystery. <i>Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?</i> is an exploration of the mysterious intersection where God and humans meet and relate. Writing as a fellow pilgrim, Yancey explores such questions as:<br /><br />Is God listening?<br />Why should God care about me?<br />If God knows everything, what’s the point of prayer?<br />Why do answers to prayer seem so inconsistent and capricious?<br />Why does God seem sometimes close and sometimes far away?<br />How can I make prayer more satisfying?<br /><br />""I have found that the most important purpose of prayer may be to let ourselves be loved by God,"" says Yancey. <i>Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?</i> encourages us to pray to God the Father who sees what lies ahead of us, knows what lies within us, and who invites us into an eternal partnership--through prayer.",4.18,351,Hardcover, ,339,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53827.Prayer,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53827.Prayer

The writer of this retelling is Lauren Winner, a young Jewish woman who has become a follower of Jesus. She is an extremely talented writer and a lecturer at Duke Divinity School that brings an intellectual edge to the biblical story. At the heart of this retelling is an accurate rendering of the traditional Bible text with historical and cultural expansions of the story that are placed in italic type to help the reader differentiate the expansions from the Bible text. Throughout the book the writer adds significant statements as ancillary asides. These ancillary statements are separated from the biblical text as ruled text. They include further development of the narrative setting, connective statements to explain the story, or development of character or background information. <p>Because Lauren has written all of the material, the elaborations in the text and the ancillary statements are in the same style and tone as the biblical text and make for a thoroughly stimulating read. While Lauren's writing style is very conversational, her scholarship is of the highest quality. An extremely accurate rendering of the biblical text is the foundation for this provocative and enlightening retelling of Matthew's Gospel. The reader will feel as if he is having a personal discussion with Matthew. </p><p>A unique formatting of the narrative text of the Scriptures is being used in all of the Gospel products in The Voice. It is readily apparent who the speaker is in dialogue without the interruptions to the story found in most versions of the Bible, the narrative element of the text is clear, and the ancillary material is easily distinguished from the Bible. The story reads like a novel with fascinating bonus gems provided to make this one of the most satisfying Bible reading experiences ever.</p><p>The biblical scholarship and writing style have been checked by two biblical reviewers, the senior theological scholar on The Voice Scripture Project, the senior writer, a biblical archaeologist, copyeditors and proofreaders, and the executive editor of the project. Lauren's work in Matthew has already been used to compile <i>The Last Eyewitness</i>, <i>Songs from the Voice</i> volume two, and the upcoming <i>Son of the Most High</i>. </p><p>The Voice is a Scripture project to rediscover the story of the Bible. It is holistic, beautiful, sensitive, and balanced. As a part of the project a contextualized version of the Bible is being created through a truly unique retelling process with an emphasis on the cultural transference to the postmodern culture and with great attention being given to literary artistry.</p>",3.93,181,Paperback, ,10,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53855.The_Voice_of_Matthew,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53855.The_Voice_of_Matthew

W. Norton  Company,eng,false,"<b>The definitive refutation to the argument of The Bell Curve.</b><br /><br />How smart are you? If that question doesn't spark a dozen more questions in your mind (like ""What do you mean by 'smart,'"" ""How do I measure it"" and ""Who's asking?""), then <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, Stephen Jay Gould's masterful demolition of the IQ industry, should be required reading. Gould's brilliant, funny, engaging prose dissects the motivations behind those who would judge intelligence, and hence worth, by cranial size, convolutions, or score on extremely narrow tests. How did scientists decide that intelligence was unipolar and quantifiable? Why did the standard keep changing over time? Gould's answer is clear and simple: power maintains itself. European men of the 19th century, even before Darwin, saw themselves as the pinnacle of creation and sought to prove this assertion through hard measurement. When one measure was found to place members of some ""inferior"" group such as women or Southeast Asians over the supposedly rightful champions, it would be discarded and replaced with a new, more comfortable measure. The 20th-century obsession with numbers led to the institutionalization of IQ testing and subsequent assignment to work (and rewards) commensurate with the score, shown by Gould to be not simply misguided--for surely intelligence is multifactorial--but also regressive, creating a feedback loop rewarding the rich and powerful. The revised edition includes a scathing critique of Herrnstein and Murray's <i>The Bell Curve</i>, taking them to task for rehashing old arguments to exploit a new political wave of uncaring belt tightening.

The letters are frantic and comedic, self- righteous and intensely cynical. He writes to friends and family, famous authors he admired and even the president of the United States.

Ships shrinkwrapped.</b> <p>The first volume, <i>The Complete Peanuts 1950-1952</i>, covers the first two and a quarter years of the strip (October 1950 through December 1952), and will be of particular fascination to <i>Peanuts</i> aficionados worldwide: Although there have been literally hundreds of <i>Peanuts</i> books published, many of the strips from the series' first two or three years have never been collected before—in large part because they showed a young Schulz working out the kinks in his new strip and include some characterizations and designs that are quite different from the cast we're all familiar with (Among other things, three major cast members—Schroeder, Lucy, and Linus—initially show up as infants and only ""grow"" into their final ""mature"" selves as the months go by. Even Snoopy debuts as a puppy!). </p><p>The second volume, <i>The Complete Peanuts 1953-1954</i>, begins with <i>Peanuts</i>' third full year and a cast of eight: Charlie Brown, Shermy, Patty, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy, the recently born Linus, and Snoopy. By the end of 1954, this will have expanded to nine. Linus still doesn't speak (except, on a few occasions, to himself, à la Snoopy), but Schulz begins laying the foundation for his emergence as the most complex and arguably most endearing character in the strip: garrulous and inquisitive, yet gentle and tolerant. And he evens acquires his ""security blanket"" in this volume! Meanwhile, Lucy, an infant just a year ago, has forcefully elbowed herself to the front of the cast, proudly wearing her banner as a troublemaker or, in Schulz's memorable phrase, ""fuss-budget."" The strong, specific relationships she sets up with each character further contributes to making her central to the strip. (She has earned her cover status on this volume.) This period's significant new character is Pig-Pen, who would remain one of the main cast members throughout the decade. And then there's Snoopy. To readers unfamiliar with the early days of the strip, Snoopy's appearances here will no doubt come as the biggest surprise. Although Snoopy has started talking/thinking to himself, he does no imitations (except for one brief shark impression), he doesn't sleep atop his doghouse (much less type or fly a Sopwith Camel), and has no fantasy life—in fact, he doesn't even walk upright! But as we know, he is merely biding his time, and his evolution continues its fascinating course within these pages.</p><p> <i>Peanuts</i> is the most successful comic strip in the history of the medium as well as one of the most acclaimed strips ever published. (In 1999, a jury of comics scholars and critics voted it the 2nd greatest comic strip of the 20th century—second only to George Herriman's <i>Krazy Kat</i>, a verdict Schulz himself cheerfully endorsed.) Charles Schulz's characters—Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, and so many more—have become American icons. A United Media poll in 2002 found <i>Peanuts</i> to be one of the most recognizable cartoon properties in the world, recognized by 94 percent of the total U.S. consumer market and a close second only to Mickey Mouse (96 percent), and higher than other familiar cartoon properties like Spider-Man (75 percent) or the Simpsons (87 percent). In <i>TV Guide</i>'s ""Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All-Time"" list, Charlie Brown and Snoopy ranked #8.</p>",4.66,704,Hardcover, ,12,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54590.The_Complete_Peanuts_1950_1954,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54590.The_Complete_Peanuts_1950_1954

Today, Snoop Dogg shills for Chrysler and white kids wear Fubu, the black-owned label whose name stands for ""For Us, By Us."" This is not the first time that black music has been appreciated, adopted, and adapted by white audiences—think jazz, blues, and rock—but Jason Tanz, a white boy who grew up in the suburban Northwest, says that hip-hop's journey through white America provides a unique window to examine the racial dissonance that has become a fact of our national life. In such culture-sharing Tanz sees white Americans struggling with their identity, and wrestling (often unsuccessfully) with the legacy of race.<br /><br />To support his anecdotally driven history of hip-hop's cross-over to white America, Tanz conducts dozens of interviews with fans, artists, producers, and promoters, including some of hip-hop's most legendary figures—such as Public Enemy's Chuck D; white rapper MC Serch; and former <i>Yo! MTV Raps</i> host Fab 5 Freddy. He travels across the country, visiting ""nerdcore"" rappers in Seattle, who rhyme about Star Wars conventions; a group of would-be gangstas in a suburb so insulated it's called ""the bubble""; a break-dancing class at the upper-crusty New Canaan Tap Academy; and many more.

In suburban America, Azadeh lived in two worlds. At home, she was the daughter of the Iranian exile community, serving tea, clinging to tradition, and dreaming of Tehran. Outside, she was a California girl who practiced yoga and listened to Madonna. For years, she ignored the tense standoff between her two cultures. But college magnified the clash between Iran and America, and after graduating, she moved to Iran as a journalist. This is the story of her search for identity, between two cultures cleaved apart by a violent history. It is also the story of Iran, a restive land lost in the twilight of its revolution. <br /><br /> Moaveni's homecoming falls in the heady days of the country's reform movement, when young people demonstrated in the streets and shouted for the Islamic regime to end. In these tumultuous times, she struggles to build a life in a dark country, wholly unlike the luminous, saffron and turquoise-tinted Iran of her imagination. As she leads us through the drug-soaked, underground parties of Tehran, into the hedonistic lives of young people desperate for change, Moaveni paints a rare portrait of Iran's rebellious next generation. The landscape of her Tehran -- ski slopes, fashion shows, malls and cafes -- is populated by a cast of young people whose exuberance and despair brings the modern reality of Iran to vivid life.",3.69,272,Paperback, ,401,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54859.Lipstick_Jihad,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54859.Lipstick_Jihad

And if she can't get that from her parents, then why not from her mother's boyfriend, or her father's muscle-bound neighbor, Mr. Vuoso? Alicia Erian's incandescent debut novel, <i>Towelhead</i>, will ring true for readers who remember the rarely poetic transition from childhood to young adulthood. Jasira is a creature of contradiction: both innocent (reading romantic intentions into the grossest displays of lust) and oddly clear-sighted, especially when it comes to the imbalance of power, and the things we do for love. When her mother exiles her to Houston to live with Jasira's strict, quick-to-anger Lebanese father, she quickly learns what aspects of herself to suppress in front of him. In private, however, she conducts her sexual awakening with all the false confidence that pop culture and her neighbor's <i>Playboy</i> magazines have provided.<br /><br />Jasira tells her story with candor and glimmers of dark, unexpected humor--as when she describes her mother's boyfriend Barry's assistance in her personal grooming: ""A week later, Barry broke down and told her the truth. That he had shaved me himself. That he had been shaving me for weeks. That he couldn't seem to stop shaving me."" The freshness of her narrative voice sets <i>Towelhead</i> apart from the sentimental or purely harsh treatment of similar subject matter elsewhere, and makes the novel a promising follow-up to Erian's well-regarded short story collection, <i>The Brutal Language of Love</i>. <i>--Regina Marler</i>",3.62,336,Paperback, ,465,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54881.Towelhead,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54881.Towelhead

She’s Not There is a portrait of a loving marriage—the love of James for his wife, Grace, and, against all odds, the enduring love of Grace for the woman who becomes her ""sister,"" Jenny.<br /><br />To this extraordinary true story, Boylan brings the humorous, fresh voice that won her accolades as one of the best comic novelists of her generation. With her distinctive and winning perspective, She’s Not There explores the dramatic outward changes and unexpected results of life as a woman: Jenny fights the urge to eat salad, while James consumed plates of ribs; gone is the stability of ""one damn mood, all the damn time.""<br /> <br />While Boylan’s own secret was unusual, to say the least, she captures the universal sense of feeling uncomfortable, out of sorts with the world, and misunderstood by her peers. Jenny is supported on her journey by her best friend, novelist Richard Russo, who goes from begging his friend to ""Be a man"" (in every sense of the word) to accepting her as an attractive, buoyant woman. ""The most unexpected thing,"" Russo writes in his Afterword to the book, ""is in how Jenny’s story we recognize our shared humanity.""<br />As James evolves into Jennifer in scenes that are by turns tender, startling, and witty, a marvelously human perspective emerges on issues of love, sex, and the fascinating relationship between our physical and our intuitive selves.

It contains sketches of orange growers, orange botanists, orange pickers, orange packers, early settlers on Florida's Indian River, the first orange barons, modern concentrate makers, and a fascinating profile of Ben Hill Griffin of Frostproof, Florida who may be the last of the individual orange barons. McPhee's astonishing book has an almost narrative progression, is immensely readable, and is frequently amusing. Louis XIV hung tapestries of oranges in the halls of Versailles, because oranges and orange trees were the symbols of his nature and his reign. This book, in a sense, is a tapestry of oranges, too—with elements in it that range from the great orangeries of European monarchs to a custom of people in the modern Caribbean who split oranges and clean floors with them, one half in each hand.",4.07,160,Paperback, ,179,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54983.Oranges,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54983.Oranges

But Saturday Night Live, launched in 1975 and still thriving today, would change the face of television. It introduced brash new stars with names like Belushi, Radner, Chase, and Murray; trashed taboos that had inhibited TV for decades; and had such an impact on American life, laughter, and politics that even presidents of the United States had to take notice. Now, Pulitzer Prize-winner Tom Shales and bestselling author James Andrew Miller bring together stars, writers, guest hosts, contributors, and craftsmen for the first-ever oral history of Saturday Night Live, from 1974, when it was just an idea, through 2002, when it has long since become an institution. In their own words, dozens of personalities recall the backstage stories, behind-the-scenes gossip, feuds, foibles, drugs, sex, struggles, and calamities, including personal details never before revealed. Shales and Miller have interviewed a galaxy of stars, including Mike Myers, Chris Rock, Bill Murray, Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler, Chevy Chase, Will Ferrell, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Martin, Jon Lovitz, Jane Curtin, Billy Crystal, Martin Short, Dana Carvey, Tina Fey, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Kattan, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Garrett Morris, Molly Shannon, Damon Wayans, Chris Elliott, Julia Sweeney, Norm Macdonald, and Paul Simon-plus writers like Al Franken, Conan O'Brien, Larry David, Rosie Shuster, Jack Handey, Robert Smigel, Don Novello, and others who got their big breaks as part of the SNL team.

In this breakthrough study, the preeminent war historian John Keegan goes to the heart of a series of important conflicts to develop a powerful argument about military intelligence. <br />In his characteristically wry and perceptive prose, Keegan offers us nothing short of a new history of war through the prism of intelligence. He brings to life the split-second decisions that went into waging war before the benefit of aerial surveillance and electronic communications. The English admiral Horatio Nelson was hot on the heels of Napoleon's fleet in the Mediterranean and never knew it, while Stonewall Jackson was able to compensate for the Confederacy's disadvantage in firearms and manpower with detailed maps of the Appalachians. In the past century, espionage and decryption have changed the face of battle: the Japanese surprise attack at the Battle of the Midway was thwarted by an early warning. Timely information, however, is only the beginning of the surprising and disturbing aspects of decisions that are made in war, where brute force is often more critical. <br />""Intelligence in War"" is a thought-provoking work that ranks among John Keegan's finest achievements.",3.66,387,Hardcover, ,85,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55195.Intelligence_in_War,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55195.Intelligence_in_War

The seer's warlords are locked into a power struggle that threatens the very soul of the rebellion, while Sha'ik herself suffers, haunted by the knowledge of her nemesis: her own sister, Tavore.<br />And so begins this awesome new chapter in Steven Erikson's acclaimed Malazan Book of the Fallen.",4.33,1015,Mass Market Paperback, ,862,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55398.House_of_Chains,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55398.House_of_Chains

However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts.

Yet few beyond her close friends and family have ever heard her account of her extraordinary journey. She writes with candor, humor and passion about her upbringing in suburban, middle-class America in the 1950s and her transformation from Goldwater Girl to student activist to controversial First Lady. Living History is her revealing memoir of life through the White House years. It is also her chronicle of living history with Bill Clinton, a thirty-year adventure in love and politics that survives personal betrayal, relentless partisan investigations and constant public scrutiny. <br /><br />Hillary Rodham Clinton came of age during a time of tumultuous social and political change in America. Like many women of her generation, she grew up with choices and opportunities unknown to her mother or grandmother. She charted her own course through unexplored terrain -- responding to the changing times and her own internal compass -- and became an emblem for some and a lightning rod for others. Wife, mother, lawyer, advocate and international icon, she has lived through America's great political wars, from Watergate to Whitewater. <br /><br />The only First Lady to play a major role in shaping domestic legislation, Hillary Rodham Clinton traveled tirelessly around the country to champion health care, expand economic and educational opportunity and promote the needs of children and families, and she crisscrossed the globe on behalf of women's rights, human rights and democracy. She redefined the position of First Lady and helped save the presidency from an unconstitutional, politically motivated impeachment.
