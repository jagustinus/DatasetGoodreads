It all changed, however, when he serendipitously landed a job as a salesman for The Firm—a company that offered up-front cash to lottery winners in exchange for their prize money, often paid in agonizingly small annual payments, some lasting up to twenty-five years. For the better part of the ensuing decade, Ed spent his time closing deals with lottery winners, making a lucrative and legitimate—if sometimes not-so-nice—living by taking advantage of their weaknesses . . . weaknesses he knew all too well.<br /><br />Ed met hundreds of lottery winners and saw up-close the often hilarious, sometime sad outcome when great wealth is dropped on ordinary people. Once lottery winners realized their ""dream-come-true"" multimillion jackpots were not all that they were cracked up to be, Ed would knock on their door, offering them the cash they wanted-and often desperately need. This cash sometimes came at a high price, but winners were rarely in a position to walk the other way. As Ed learned, few of them had the financial savvy to keep up with the lottery-winner lifestyle. In fact, some just wanted their old lives back.<br /><br />A charmingly neurotic gambler, Ed traveled deep into the heart of the country where he discovered the American Dream looks a lot like a day at the casino. And Ed knows casinos. In fact, his own taste for gambling gave him a unique insight into lottery winners: he intimately understood their mindset, making it that much easier to relate to them. And like lottery winners, Ed struggled to find balance in his own life as his increasing success earned him a bigger and bigger salary. Even as he relished his accomplishments, he grappled with the question: ""If you are good at something that is bad for some people, does that make you a bad person?""<br /><br />Ed Ugel takes the readers inside the captivating world of lottery winners and shows us how lotteries and gambling have become deeply inscribed in every aspect of American life shaping our image of success and good fortune. <em>Money for Nothing</em> is a witty, wise, and often outrageously funny account of high expectations and easy money.",3.17,238,Hardcover, ,77,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/512902.Money_for_Nothing,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/512902.Money_for_Nothing

This time, however, it's Borogravia that's getting its long overdue comeuppance, which has left the country severely drained of young men.<br /><br />Ever since her brother Paul marched off to battle a year ago, Polly Perks has been running The Duchess,her family's inn -- even though the revered national deity Nuggan has decreed that female ownership of a business is an Abomination (with, among others, oysters, rocks, and the color blue). To keep The Duchess in the family, Polly must find her missing sibling.

Or perhaps the sergeant is simply too desperate for fresh cannon fodder to discriminate -- which would explain why a vampire, a troll, a zombie, a religious fanatic, and two uncommonly close ""friends"" are also eagerly welcomed into the fighting fold.

Suddenly a trawl line cinched around his leg and within seconds he was being dragged overboard to a sure death twenty fathoms below. As he clung desperately to the stern of the Black Sheep his life literally passed before his eyes. In those pain-filled terrifying minutes he recalled his boyhood, growing up on Good Harbor Beach, the son of one-time professional football player Ted Williams, and the lessons his father taught him that would save his life. Williams lived to record the memories that filled those minutes - from a boyhood working for his father in a fish-packing plant on the Gloucester waterfront to his own career lobster-fishing alone in the North Atlantic. F/V Black Sheep is the story of that afternoon and the memories that came rushing back. Williams takes us from the violent world of the Gloucester waterfront where he once spent a summer shooting rats for the owner of Empire Fish Company through brawls with vicious men, encounters with enticing women, and the omnipresent dangers of a life lived working on the ocean. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes breath-taking, always entertaining (including a humorous recollection of an evening spent drinking with ""Sully"" who was to die aboard the Andrea Gail shortly afterwards) the stories that comprise F/V Black Sheep build to a heart-stopping conclusion as Williams is dragged overboard, descends to the bottom of the ocean, and a rescue so remarkable it took him years to acknowledge it.",3.75,348,Paperback, ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514365.F_V_Black_Sheep,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514365.F_V_Black_Sheep

He says he was threatened and bribed in an effort to kill the project, but after 9/11 he finally decided to go through with this expose of his former professional life. Perkins, a former chief economist at Boston strategic-consulting firm Chas. T. Main, says he was an ""economic hit man"" for 10 years, helping U.S. intelligence agencies and multinationals cajole and blackmail foreign leaders into serving U.S. foreign policy and awarding lucrative contracts to American business. ""Economic hit men (EHMs) are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars,"" Perkins writes. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an extraordinary and gripping tale of intrigue and dark machinations. Think John Le Carré, except it's a true story.<br /><br />Perkins writes that his economic projections cooked the books Enron-style to convince foreign governments to accept billions of dollars of loans from the World Bank and other institutions to build dams, airports, electric grids, and other infrastructure he knew they couldn't afford. The loans were given on condition that construction and engineering contracts went to U.S. companies. Often, the money would simply be transferred from one bank account in Washington, D.C., to another one in New York or San Francisco. The deals were smoothed over with bribes for foreign officials, but it was the taxpayers in the foreign countries who had to pay back the loans. When their governments couldn't do so, as was often the case, the U.S. or its henchmen at the World Bank or International Monetary Fund would step in and essentially place the country in trusteeship, dictating everything from its spending budget to security agreements and even its United Nations votes. It was, Perkins writes, a clever way for the U.S. to expand its ""empire"" at the expense of Third World citizens.",3.86,303,Paperback, ,406,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514964.Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hitman,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514964.Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hitman

The Roman writers reflected the double standards of an invading society: condemning the public sacrifice of enemies by the Druids while accepting their own practice of slaughter for sport as civilized. Yet the Classical sources can be used to help reveal the real Druids, and we learn of their multiple roles as judges, teachers, healers, magicians, philosophers, religious leaders, and fomenters of rebellion.<br /><br /><br />This book traces the history of the Druids from their beginnings to their resurrection during the Renaissance.

There appeared to be no way to reconcile the new theory of quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of relativity. Several approaches had been tried and had failed. In the post-World War II period, four eminent physicists rose to the challenge and developed a calculable version of quantum electrodynamics (QED), probably the most successful theory in physics. This formulation of QED was pioneered by Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, three of whom won the Nobel Prize for their work. In this book, physicist and historian Silvan Schweber tells the story of these four physicists, blending discussions of their scientific work with fascinating biographical sketches.<br /><br /><br /><br />Setting the achievements of these four men in context, Schweber begins with an account of the early work done by physicists such as Dirac and Jordan, and describes the gathering of eminent theorists at Shelter Island in 1947, the meeting that heralded the new era of QED. The rest of his narrative comprises individual biographies of the four physicists, discussions of their major contributions, and the story of the scientific community in which they worked. Throughout, Schweber draws on his technical expertise to offer a lively and lucid explanation of how this theory was finally established as the appropriate way to describe the atomic and subatomic realms.",4.42,768,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520257.Qed_and_the_Men_Who_Made_It,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520257.Qed_and_the_Men_Who_Made_It

What is the voyeuristic impulse behind our attraction to the gruesome and the horrible? Where does the magnetic appeal of the sordid and the scandalous come from? Is ugliness also in the eye of the beholder?<br />Eco's encyclopedic knowledge and captivating storytelling skills combine in this ingenious study of the Ugly, revealing that what we often shield ourselves from and shun in everyday life is what we're most attracted to subliminally. Topics range from Milton's Satan to Goethe's Mephistopheles; from witchcraft and medieval torture tactics to martyrs, hermits, and penitents; from lunar births and disemboweled corpses to mythic monsters and sideshow freaks; and from Decadentism and picturesque ugliness to the tacky, kitsch, and camp, and the aesthetics of excess and vice. With abundant examples of painting and sculpture ranging from ancient Greek amphorae to Bosch, Brueghel, and Goya among others, and with quotations from the most celebrated writers and philosophers of each age, this provocative discussion explores in-depth the concepts of evil, depravity, and darkness in art and literature.",3.85,456,Hardcover, ,113,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520738.On_Ugliness,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/520738.On_Ugliness

It is commonplace and it is impossible to imagine. It is prosaic and it is mysterious. It is at once banal, bizarre, compelling, tedious, comic, and catastrophic. To become a mother is to become the chief actor in a drama of human existence to which no one turns up. It is the process by which an ordinary life is transformed unseen into a story of strange and powerful passions, of love and servitude, of confinement and compassion.<br /><br />In a book that is touching, hilarious, provocative, and profoundly insightful, novelist Rachel Cusk attempts to tell something of an old story set in a new era of sexual equality. Cusk's account of a year of modern motherhood becomes many stories: a farewell to freedom, sleep, and time; a lesson in humility and hard work; a journey to the roots of love; a meditation on madness and mortality; and most of all a sentimental education in babies, books, toddler groups, bad advice, crying, breastfeeding, and never being alone.<br /><br /><b>""Funny and smart and refreshingly akin to a war diary--sort of Apocalypse Baby Now...<i>A Life's Work</i> is wholly original and unabashedly true.""--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b>",3.86,224,Paperback, ,193,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522426.A_Life_s_Work,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/522426.A_Life_s_Work

But the country failed to recover from the staggering economic collapse of the early 1990s. Today it confronts an array of disturbing social trends, notably a population of more than one million <i>hikikomori</i>: the young men who shut themselves in their rooms, withdrawing from society. There is also a growing numbers of “parasite singles”: single women who refuse to leave home, marry, or bear children.<br /><br />   In this trenchant investigation, Michael Zielenziger argues that Japan's tradition-steeped society, its aversion to change, and its distrust of individuality are stifling economic revival, political reform, and social evolution. <i>Shutting Out the Sun</i> is a bold explanation of Japan's stagnation and its implications for the rest of the world.",3.58,352,Paperback, ,30,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/524444.Shutting_Out_the_Sun,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/524444.Shutting_Out_the_Sun

Kennedy or his brother Robert Kennedy have woven either a tale of Camelot or a tawdry tale of ambition &amp; reckless personal behavior. But the real story of the Kennedys in the 1960s has been submerged. <br /><br />""Brothers"" sheds light on the inner life of the Kennedy presidency &amp; its aftermath. Talbot, founder of Salon.com, has written a political history sure to be talked about. It begins on the afternoon of November 22, 1963, as a stricken Robert urgently demands answers about his brother's assassination. His suspicions focus on the nest of CIA spies, gangsters &amp; Cuban exiles who'd long plotted a violent regime change in Cuba. The Kennedys had struggled to control this swamp of anti-Castro intrigue based in South Florida, but with little success. It then shifts back in time, revealing the shadowy conflicts that tore apart the Kennedy administration, pitting the president &amp; his brother against their own national security apparatus. <br /><br />The brothers &amp; a small circle of their trusted advisors -- men like Theodore Sorensen, Robert McNamara &amp; Kenny O'Donnell, who were so close as to be regarded as family -- repeatedly thwarted Washington's warrior caste. These hard-line generals &amp; spymasters were hell-bent on a showdown with Communism -- in Berlin, Laos, Vietnam &amp; especially Cuba. But the Kennedys frustrated their militaristic ambitions, pushing for a peaceful resolution to the Cold War. The tensions within the administration were headed for an explosive climax, when gunfire in Dallas terminated JFK's presidency. <br /><br />Based on over 150 interviews -- including many of the Kennedys' aging band of brothers, whose testimony here may be their final word on this political story -- as well as newly released government documents, ""Brothers"" reveals the untold story of those years, including JFK's efforts to keep the USA out of war &amp; RFK's secret quest to solve his brother's murder. Bobby's subterranean search was a dangerous one &amp; led, in part, to his own campaign in 1968 leading to his own death. RFK may have been the victim of the same plotters he suspected of killing his brother. <br /><br />This is history at its best -- meticulously researched, movingly told. It's a sprawling narrative about the clash of powerful men &amp; the darker side of the Cold War -- a tale of tragic grandeur that will change understandings of the Kennedy saga.",4.09,494,Hardcover, ,149,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/524654.Brothers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/524654.Brothers

Engaging, funny, elegant and ironic, Tillman takes the reader to new heights of wit and meaning through staccato phrases, grammatical twists and sensuous language. Familiar worlds of honesty, deceit, dark humor, pleasure, pain, confusion, dependence, love and lust each play decisive roles in her believable fictions. In ""Come and Go,"" three characters and an author collide. In ""Pleasure Isn't a Pretty Picture,"" the reader is treated to a he/she meditation on the one-night stand. And ""Dead Sleep"" is truly an insomniac's worst nightmare. A twin act on a double bill, <i>This Is Not It</i> is a collection of innovative and stand-alone writing that also engages and matches wits with the some of the best contemporary art: work by Kiki Smith, Jane Dickson, Jessica Stockholder, Diller &amp; Scofidio, Laura Letinsky, Peter Dreher, Roni Horn, Stephen Ellis, Juan Munoz, Vik Muniz, Silvia Kolbowski, Jeff Koons, James Welling, Aura Rosenberg, Barbara Ess, Barbara Kruger, Dolores Marat, Haim Steinbach, Gary Schneider, Marco Breuer, Stephen Prina and Linder Sterling. Since 1982, acclaimed novelist Tillman has created these unique narratives that are a parallel universe to the contemporary art world. Maybe they're analogues or dialogues, maybe fictions inspired by art, maybe reflections, or meditations--but whatever they're called, like Borges's fictions, they are their own worlds, too. Tillman has marked out terrain of her own, which this collection celebrates.

He appears in psychology textbooks, illuminating the workings of the mind in a way no straightforward explanation can. <p>In three definitive volumes (The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin, The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin and The Subtleties of the Inimitable Mulla Nasrudin) Idries Shah takes us to the very heart of this mysterious mentor, the Mulla Nasrudin. Skillful contemporary retellings of hundreds of collected stories and sayings bring the unmistakable--often backhanded--wisdom, wit and charm of the timeless jokester to life. </p><p>The Mulla and his stories appear in literature and oral traditions from the Middle East to Greece, Russia, France--even China. Many nations claim Nasrudin as a native son, but nobody really knows who he was or where he came from. </p><p>According to a legend dating from at least the 13th century, Nasrudin was snatched as a schoolboy from the clutches of the ""Old Villain""--the crude system of thought that ensnares man--to carry through the ages the message of how to escape. He was chosen because he could make people laugh, and humor has a way of slipping through the cracks of the most rigid thinking habits. </p><p>Acclaimed as humorous masterpieces, as collections of the finest jokes, as priceless gift books, and for hundreds ""enchanted tales,"" this folklore figure's antics have also been divined as ""mirroring the antics of the mind."" The jokes are, as Idries Shah notes, ""perfectly designed models for isolating and holding distortions of the mind which so often pass for reasonable behavior."" Therefore they have a double use: when the jokes have been enjoyed, their psychological significance starts to sink in. </p><p>In fact, for many centuries they have been studied in Sufi circles for their hidden wisdom. They are used as teaching exercises, in part to momentarily ""freeze"" situations in which states of mind can be recognized. The key to the philosophic significance of the Nasrudin jokes is given in Idries Shah's book The Sufis and a complete system of mystical training based upon them was described in the Hibbert Journal. </p><p>In these delightful volumes, Shah not only gives the Mulla a proper vehicle for our times, he proves that the centuries-old stories and quips of Nasrudin are still some of the funniest jokes in the world.</p>",4.35,224,Paperback, ,33,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530425.The_Pleasantries_of_the_Incredible_Mulla_Nasrudin,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530425.The_Pleasantries_of_the_Incredible_Mulla_Nasrudin

Encouraged by one of his roommates to try an experimental drug meant to banish indecision, Dwight jumps at the chance (not without some vacillation about the hazards of jumping) and swallows the first fateful pill. And when all at once he is “pfired” by Pfizer and invited to a rendezvous in exotic Ecuador with the girl of his long-ago prep-school dreams, he finds himself on the brink of a new life.

The color of it must be spring green, impossible to describe until I see a just-hatched lizard sunning on a stone. That color, the glowing green lizard skin, repeats in every new leaf. The regenerative power of nature explodes in every weed, stalk, branch. Working in the mild sun, I feel the green fuse of my body, too.

A sabbatical from teaching in San Francisco allowed her to return to Cortona--and her beloved house, Bramasole--just as the first green appeared on the rocky hillsides.<br /><br />Bella Tuscany, a companion volume to Under the Tuscan Sun, is her passionate and lyrical account of her continuing love affair with Italy. Now truly at home there, Mayes writes of her deepening connection to the land, her flourishing friendships with local people, the joys of art, food, and wine, and the rewards and occasional heartbreaks of her villa's ongoing restoration. It is also a memoir of a season of change, and of renewed possibility. As spring becomes summer she revives Bramasole's lush gardens, meets the challenges of learning a new language, tours regions from Sicily to the Veneto, and faces transitions in her family life.<br /><br />Filled with recipes from her Tuscan kitchen and written in the sensuous and evocative prose that has become her hallmark, Bella Tuscany is a celebration of the sweet life in Italy.",3.76,304,Paperback, ,395,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531421.Bella_Tuscany,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/531421.Bella_Tuscany

By the end of the evening, the pivotal events of Alex-Li's youth have occurred: he has met Joseph Klein, a boy whose fascination with autographs proves infectious; his friendships with Adam and Rubinfine are cemented; and his father has dropped dead. This is enough action for an entire book, and in fact things slow down dramatically after page 35 of Zadie Smith's sophomore novel <i>The Autograph Man</i>. When we meet Alex again, he is a grown man, an autograph dealer and devoted slacker, suffering the physical and spiritual after-effects of a three-day romance with a drug called ""Superstar."" While under its malign influence, Alex has managed to wreck his sports car, alienate his girlfriend Esther, and--possibly--forge the rare autograph of his idol, the 1950s movie star Kitty Alexander. Will his friends save him from the embarrassment of trying to sell this suspect autograph? Will they pull him together in time to perform Kaddish on the 15th anniversary of his father's death? Although not as enthralling or politically resonant as <i>White Teeth</i>, Smith's hallowed debut, <i>The Autograph Man</i> amply demonstrates her ability to juggle several main characters, several themes, and a host of plots and subplots, with the occasional purely comic episode thrown up in the air beside them like a chainsaw or a cheesecake. Readers will want to step away to a safe distance during the chaotic final scenes. <i>--Regina Marler</i>",3.16,368,Hardcover, ,45,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535308.The_Autograph_Man,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/535308.The_Autograph_Man

In the course of this investigation, he discovers an ominous thread: the presence on the scenes of these deaths of the anthology <i>Poems and Rhymes Around the World</i>, opened to the page where there appears an African chant or ""culling song."" This song turns out to be lethal when spoken or even thought in anyone's direction—and once it lodges in Streator's brain, he finds himself becoming an involuntary serial killer. So he teams up with a real estate broker, one Helen Hoover Boyle, who specializes in selling haunted (or ""distressed"") houses (wonderfully high turnover), and who lost a child to the culling song years before.

His is a crime of disclosure, heinous and heretical in the Church's eyes, in that his research threatens to subvert the whole secular order of Renaissance society. Like his namesake Christopher Colombus, he has made a discovery of enormous significance for humankind. Whereas Colombus voyaged outward to explore the world and found the Americas, Mateo Colombo looked inward, across the mons veneris, and uncovered the clitoris.

  <blockquote>In the first volume of his monumental trilogy about the liberation of Europe in WW II, Pulitzer Prize winner Rick Atkinson tells the riveting story of the war in North Africa</blockquote>
</b>The liberation of Europe and the destruction of the Third Reich is a story of courage and enduring triumph, of calamity and miscalculation. In this first volume of the Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson shows why no modern reader can understand the ultimate victory of the Allied powers without a grasp of the great drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943. That first year of the Allied war was a pivotal point in American history, the moment when the United States began to act like a great power.<br /><br />Beginning with the daring amphibious invasion in November 1942, An Army at Dawn follows the American and British armies as they fight the French in Morocco and Algeria, and then take on the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. Battle by battle, an inexperienced and sometimes poorly led army gradually becomes a superb fighting force. Central to the tale are the extraordinary but fallible commanders who come to dominate the battlefield: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Montgomery, and Rommel.<br /><br />Brilliantly researched, rich with new material and vivid insights, Atkinson's narrative provides the definitive history of the war in North Africa.",4.28,704,Hardcover, ,838,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/541920.An_Army_at_Dawn,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/541920.An_Army_at_Dawn

But no comparison could prepare us for what is surely one of the most original and adventurous novels of the decade: <i>Infinite Jest</i>.<br /><br /><i>Infinite Jest</i> is the name of a movie said to be so entertaining that anyone who watches it loses all desire to do anything <i>but</i> watch it. People die happily, viewing it in endless repetition. The novel <i>Infinite Jest</i> is the story of this addictive entertainment, and in particular how it affects a Boston halfway house for recovering addicts and a nearby tennis academy, whose students have many budding addictions of their own. As the novel unfolds, various individuals, organizations, and governments vie to obtain the master copy of <i>Infinite Jest</i> for their own ends, and the denizens of the tennis school and the halfway house are caught up in increasingly desperate efforts to control the movie – as is a cast including burglars, transvestite muggers, scam artists, medical professionals, pro football stars, bookies, drug addicts both active and recovering, film students, political assassins, and one of the most endearingly messed-up families ever captured in a novel.<br /><br />On this outrageous frame hangs an exploration of essential questions about what entertainment is, and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment interacts with our need to connect with other humans; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, <i>Infinite Jest</i> bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. The huge cast and multilevel narrative serve a story that accelerates to a breathtaking, heartbreaking, unforgettable conclusion. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the very idea of what a novel can do.<br /><br /><i>(from dust-jacket of the First Edition, 1996)</i>",4.28,1079,Hardcover,First Edition,184,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544063.Infinite_Jest,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/544063.Infinite_Jest

""It's a great place to live, they say, if you like surprises: it's just like life, only different."" <br /><br />Certainly a number of Rito's inhabitants--fewer than a hundred in all--are surprised to be living here. Red Ray, for instance, a wildly alcoholic lawyer who bought a dilapidated Victorian mansion in an attempt to rehabilitate his marriage and regain the affections of his wife and young son. After destroying those hopes with a spectacular final binge, Red established a drunk farm, Round Rock, on the ruins. There, one day at a time, he follows his new, unexpected calling.<br /><br />Many months after her husband decamped (almost immediately) for Los Angeles, Libby Daw still lives alone in their trailer, and finds herself even more rooted to the valley she dreams of escaping.<br /><br />And there's Lewis Fletcher, a sometime graduate student whose keen intelligence is sorely tested by his erratic behavior and current predicament. Without exactly knowing why, and entirely against his wishes--or by default and sheer good luck--he finds himself placed in Ray's care at Round Rock.<br /><br />As these people seek out or maintain their various niches in the valley, the peculiar history of the place asserts itself. An heiress descended from the original settlers, Billie Fitzgerald still acts as though she owns it all; devoted to her father and son, she obscures her mercurial emotions from even her closest friends. The past also returns with David Ibañez, whose family had harvested the groves for generations--and whose talents and secrets (and thus, he discovers, his future) are inextricably bound to the complex, close-knit town he thought he had left behind.<br /><br />With insight matched with artistry, Michelle Huneven traces the emerging destinies of these characters as each of them struggles for peace and equilibrium, even happiness and love, against hapless, all-too-human frailty and circumstance. <br /><br />A vivid evocation of landscape and community, Round Rock derives great power from psychological subtlety, and from affection for and profound understanding of lives strained or broken but on the mend.

These author's cut are the real deal, not the homogenized fluff offered up by magazine editors who are often unwilling to offend. Twight's words make it clear that climbing is only distantly about the summit. Several of these pieces are new to U.S. readers. Twight edited all of the selections and appended each with a current author's note; confessing his inspiration, events that followed, and lessons learned (or not learned, some might say). It adds up to a frightfully lucid look into Twight's personal life as both man and hardcore alpine climber. The dissection scares me sometimes... Whether railing against the spinelessness of American siege-style mountaineering, admitting addiction to pushing the bounds of the possible, or reveling in his ability to cut away anything in life that holds him back, Twight never blinks. Along the way, there is the drama of new and epic routes, unbreakable bonds between climbing partners, and Twight's evolution as a climber and a man. He tells every story in a unique, in-your-face style.<br /><br /><em>Kiss or Kill</em> is not an easy read. It may scare some readers-but that's the point.

You wake up in an 8' x 6' concrete-and-steel cell designated ""Suicide Watch #3."" The cell is real. Jimmy Lerner, formerly a suburban husband and father, and corporate strategic planner and survivor, is about to become a prison ""fish,"" or green new arrival. Taken to a penitentiary in the Nevada desert to begin serving a twelve-year term for voluntary manslaughter, this once nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn ends up sharing a claustrophobic cell with Kansas, a hugely muscled skinhead with a swastika engraved on his neck and a serious set of issues. And if he dares complain, the guards will bluntly tell him, ""You got nothing coming.""<br /><br />Bringing us into a world of petty corruption, racial strife, and crank-addicted neo-Nazis, Jimmy Lerner gives us a fish’s progress: a brash, compelling, and darkly comic story peopled with characters who are at various times funny, violent, and surprisingly tender. His rendering of prison language is mesmerizingly vivid and exact, and his search for a way not simply to survive but to craft a new way to live, in the most unpropitious of circumstances, is a tale filled with resilience, dignity, and a profound sense of the absurd. In the book’s climax, we learn just what demonic set of circumstances–a compound of bad luck and worse judgment–led him to the lethal act of self-defense that landed him in a circle of an American hell.<br /><br />Electrifying, unforgettable, bracingly cynical, and perceptive, <i>You Got Nothing Coming </i>is impossible to put down or shake off. What the cult favorite <i>Oz</i> is to television, this book is to prose–and all of the events are real.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.92,416,Paperback, ,50,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545047.You_Got_Nothing_Coming,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545047.You_Got_Nothing_Coming

For one year, they would only consume food that came from within a 100-mile radius of their Vancouver apartment. The 100-Mile Diet was born.<br /><br />The couple’s discoveries sometimes shook their resolve. It would be a year without sugar, Cheerios, olive oil, rice, Pizza Pops, beer, and much, much more. Yet local eating has turned out to be a life lesson in pleasures that are always close at hand. They met the revolutionary farmers and modern-day hunter-gatherers who are changing the way we think about food. They got personal with issues ranging from global economics to biodiversity. They called on the wisdom of grandmothers, and immersed themselves in the seasons. They discovered a host of new flavours, from gooseberry wine to sunchokes to turnip sandwiches, foods that they never would have guessed were on their doorstep.<br /><br />The 100-Mile Diet struck a deeper chord than anyone could have predicted, attracting media and grassroots interest that spanned the globe. The <b>100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating</b> tells the full story, from the insights to the kitchen disasters, as the authors transform from megamart shoppers to self-sufficient urban pioneers.

She said he had lived across the ocean near what he called the ""<i>Kamby Bolongo</i>"" and had been out in the forest one day chopping wood to make a drum when he was set upon by four men, beaten, chained and dragged aboard a slave ship bound for Colonial America.<br /><br />Still vividly remembering the stories after he grew up and became a writer, Haley began to search for documentation that might authenticate the narrative. It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of ""the African""—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the <i>Lord Ligonier</i> to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.<br /><br />Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins.

As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities.

They come from both Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews who settled all over America, bringing with them a wide variety of regional flavors, changing and adapting their traditional dishes according to what was available in the new country.<br /><br />What makes Jewish cooking unique is the ancient dietary laws that govern the selection, preparation, and consumption of observant Jews. Food plays a major part in rituals past and present, binding family and community. It is this theme that informs every part of Joan Nathan’s warm and lively text. <br /><br />Every dish has a story–from the cholents (the long-cooked rich meat stews) and kugels (vegetable and noodle puddings) prepared in advance for the Sabbath, to the potato latkes (served with maple syrup in Vermont and goat cheese in California) and gefilte fish (made with white fish in the Midwest, salmon in the Northwest, haddock in New England, and shad in Maryland). Joan Nathan tells us how lox and bagels and Lindy’s cheesecake became household words, and how American products like Crisco, cream cheese, and Jell-O changed forever Jewish home cooking.<br /><br />The recipes and stories come from every part of the U.S.A. They are seasoned with Syrian, Moroccan, Greek, German, Polish, Georgian, and Alsatian flavors, and they represent traditional foods tailored for today’s tastes as well as some of the nouvelle creations of Jewish chefs from New York to Tuscon. <br /><br />When <i>Jewish Cooking in America</i> was first published in 1994, it won both the IACP / Julia Child Cookbook Award for Best Cookbook of the Year and the James Beard Award for Best Food of the Americas Cookbook.

Crowded with characters, both human and non-human, and bursting with action, <i>The Odyssey</i> details the adventures of Odysseus, king of Ithaca and hero of the Trojan War, as he struggles to return to his home and his waiting, ever-faithful wife, Penelope. Along the way he encounters the seductive Circe, who changes men into swine; the gorgeous water-nymph, Calypso, who keeps him a “prisoner of love” for seven years; the terrible, one-eyed, man-eating giant Cyclops; and a host of other ogres, wizards, sirens, and gods. But when he finally reaches Ithaca after ten years of travel, his trials have only begun. There he must battle the scheming noblemen who, thinking him dead, have demanded that Penelope choose one of them to be her new husband—and Ithaca’s new king.<br /><br />Often called the “second work of Western literature” (The Iliad, also by Homer, being the first), <i>The Odyssey</i> is not only a rousing adventure drama, but also a profound meditation on courage, loyalty, family, fate, and undying love. More than three thousand years old, it was the first story to delineate carefully and exhaustively a single character arc — a narrative structure that serves as the foundation and heart of the modern novel. Robert Squillace’s revision of George Herbert Palmer’s classic prose translation captures the drama and vitality of adventure, while remaining true to the original Homeric language.<br /><br /><b>Robert Squillace</b> teaches in the Cultural Foundations division of New York University’s General Studies Program.

This is the story of their five-year journey into a society virtually unchanged in its behavior and lifestyle since its foundation in 1084. <i>An Infinity of Little Hours</i> is a uniquely intimate portrait of the customs and practices of a monastic order almost entirely unknown until now. It is also a drama of the men's struggle as they avoid the 1960s -- the decade of hedonism, music, fashion, and amorality -- and enter an entirely different era and a spiritual world of their own making. After five years each must face a choice: to make ""solemn profession"" and never leave Parkminster; or to turn his back on his life's ambition to find God in solitude. A remarkable investigative work, the book combines first-hand testimony with unique source material to describe the Carthusian life. And in the final chapter, which recounts a reunion forty years after the events described elsewhere in the book, Nancy Klein Maguire reveals which of the five succeeded in their quest, and which did not.",4.16,265,Paperback, ,13,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/549446.An_Infinity_of_Little_Hours,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/549446.An_Infinity_of_Little_Hours

""The most awesome transfer of power in the world—, the power to marshal &amp; mobilize, the power to send men to kill or be killed, the power to tax &amp; destroy, the power to create &amp; the responsibility to do so, the power to guide &amp; the responsibility to heal —all committed into the hands of one man."" These words, written by Theodore H. White in the opening chapter of this book, are as true today as when they were written over a half-century ago. His unprecedented examination of crucial campaign, in which the young, charismatic John F. Kennedy squared off against the seasoned vice president, Richard M. Nixon, is both a fascinating historical document &amp; a compelling narrative of character &amp; consequence. The reporter's detailed appreciation of the instinct &amp; experience that shape the political process is a revelation in our current age of sound bites, relentlessly chattering punditry &amp; the all-consuming influence of tv, —an influence 1st felt in the Kennedy-Nixon debates that proved to be a critical factor in the 1960 election. Following seven candidates from the earliest stirrings of aspiration thru the rigors of the primaries, the drama of the conventions &amp; the grueling campaigning that culminated in one of the closest electoral contests in history, White provides a valuable education in the ways &amp; means of our political life. <i>The Making of the President 1960</i> is an extraordinary document, a celebration of the genius of American democracy &amp; an anatomy of the ambition, cunning &amp; courage it demands from those who seek its highest office. For what it can teach us about the forces that determine the destiny of presidential candidates, it remains required reading today.<br /> White was born in Boston in 1915. After Harvard graduation, he was recruited by John Hersey to cover E. Asia for <i>Time</i>, becoming chief of its China Bureau in '45. This experience inspired his 1st book, <i>Thunder Out of China</i> (written with Annalee Jacoby). In '48 he went to live in Europe. His experience as a European correspondent led to <i>Fire in the Ashes</i>, published in '53. That same year he returned to the USA to work as national correspondent for <i>The Reporter</i>, then for <i>Collier's</i>. After its collapse in '56, he completed two novels, <i>The Mountain Road</i> &amp; <i>The View from the Fortieth Floor</i>, in the next four years. At the time <i>Collier's</i> closed, he was planning a story on ""The Making of the President 1956"" for the magazine. He revived the idea in the next election year, resulting in his most famous book, <i>The Making of the President 1960</i>, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1962. Having found his vocation as our ""storyteller of elections,"" he went on to produce three more Making of the President volumes, covering 1964, 1968 &amp; 1972 campaigns. Subsequently, he was author of <i>Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon; In Search of History: A Personal Adventure;</i> &amp; <i>America in Search of Itself: The Making of the President 1956-80.</i> He died in 5/86.",4.15,486,Hardcover, ,99,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/549449.The_Making_of_the_President_1960,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/549449.The_Making_of_the_President_1960

In the brilliant dual biography, the award-winning writer Roland Huntford re-examines every detail of the great race to the South Pole between Britain's Robert Scott and Norway's Roald Amundsen. Scott, who dies along with four of his men only eleven miles from his next cache of supplies, became Britain's beloved failure, while Amundsen, who not only beat Scott to the Pole but returned alive, was largely forgotten. This account of their race is a gripping, highly readable history that captures the driving ambitions of the era and the complex, often deeply flawed men who were charged with carrying them out. THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH is the first of Huntford's masterly trilogy of polar biographies.

Certainly not, according to our government. Despite the conquest of two sovereign states in as many years, despite the presence of more than 750 military installations in two thirds of the world’s countries and despite his stated intention ""to extend the benefits of freedom...to every corner of the world,"" George W. Bush maintains that ""America has never been an empire."" ""We don’t seek empires,"" insists Defense Secretary Rumsfeld. ""We’re not imperialistic.""Nonsense, says Niall Ferguson. In <b>Colossus</b> he argues that in both military and economic terms America is nothing less than the most powerful empire the world has ever seen. Just like the British Empire a century ago, the United States aspires to globalize free markets, the rule of law, and representative government. In theory it’s a good project, says Ferguson. Yet Americans shy away from the long-term commitments of manpower and money that are indispensable if rogue regimes and failed states really are to be changed for the better. Ours, he argues, is an empire with an attention deficit disorder, imposing ever more unrealistic timescales on its overseas interventions. Worse, it’s an empire in denial—a hyperpower that simply refuses to admit the scale of its global responsibilities. And the negative consequences will be felt at home as well as abroad. In an alarmingly persuasive final chapter Ferguson warns that this chronic myopia also applies to our domestic responsibilities. When overstretch comes, he warns, it will come from within—and it will reveal that more than just the feet of the American colossus is made of clay.",3.57,400,Hardcover, ,9,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552442.Colossus,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/552442.Colossus

Jean-Pierre Dupuy explora aquí sus trasfondos: la filosofía liberal de inspiración económica desde Adam Smith hasta John Rawls. Puesto que en la actualidad la «vía socialista» hacia la justicia parece más que hipotética, la incapacidad de pensar el mercado en sus dimensiones morales y sociopolíticas se vuelve francamente preocupante. Este libro constituye una introducción crítica a la tradición filosófica anglosajona que concibe la sociedad del mercado como un orden «espontáneo» o «autoorganizador» planteando, ante este trasfondo, el problema de la sociedad justa y buena de muchas maneras distintas. En su estudio sistemático, Dupuy propone especialmente una interpretación original de la emancipación de la economía con respecto de la moral en la obra de Adam Smith y articula su lectura de las teorías liberales de la justicia —la economía normativa, John Rawls, el utilitarismo, el libertarismo, Friedrich Hayek, Robert Nozick, etc.— con las categorías maestras del «sacrificio» y de la «envidia». La tesis de Jean-Pierre Dupuy es que la tradición liberal parece haber concebido la sociedad mercantil como muy próxima a su descomposición, siempre posible, para convertirse en una masa informe presa del pánico. La sociedad justa y buena, en cambio, es aquella que contiene —en el doble sentido de la palabra— esta amenaza.

Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen's youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce's highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce's book would ""remain a permanent part of English literature,"" while H.G. Wells dubbed it ""by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing.""

But the moment they got together, something clicked—something miraculous—and audiences saw it at once. <br /><br />Before long, they were as big as Elvis or the Beatles would be after them, creating hysteria wherever they went and grabbing an unprecedented hold over every entertainment outlet of the era: radio, television, movies, stage shows, and nightclubs. Martin and Lewis were a national craze, an American institution. The millions (and the women) flowed in, seemingly without end—and then, on July 24, 1956, ten years from the day when the two men joined forces, it all ended.<br /><br />After that traumatic day, the two wouldn’t speak again for twenty years. And while both went on to forge triumphant individual careers—Martin as a movie and television star, recording artist, and nightclub luminary (and charter member of the Rat Pack); Lewis as the groundbreaking writer, producer, director, and star of a series of hugely successful movie comedies—their parting left a hole in the national psyche, as well as in each man’s heart.<br /><br />In a memoir by turns moving, tragic, and hilarious, Jerry Lewis recounts with crystal clarity every step of a fifty-year friendship, from the springtime, 1945 afternoon when the two vibrant young performers destined to conquer the world together met on Broadway and Fifty-fourth Street, to their tragic final encounter in the 1990s, when Lewis and his wife ran into Dean Martin, a broken and haunted old man.<br /><br />In <i>Dean and Me</i>, Jerry Lewis makes a convincing case for Dean Martin as one of the great — and most underrated — comic talents of our era. But what comes across most powerfully in this definitive memoir is the depth of love Lewis felt, and still feels, for his partner, and which his partner felt for him: truly a love to last for all time.",4.05,340,Paperback, ,231,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/559797.Dean_and_Me,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/559797.Dean_and_Me

Birds grow larger than the trees they perch on, cats sniff at a pair of skulls and monkeys exchange wary glances. Elsewhere, Owens has broken away from the fine arts to move into wallpaper and textiles. Beyond all this straightforward beauty is constant inquiry into her chosen media. She has rejected naturalism in favor of depiction, representation and an unashamed pleasure in ornamentation, which, with her delight in pictorial grace, affords decoration a new dignity.

Everyone finds something in it. Who one's father is isn't immediately obvious, hardly being visible to the naked eye. Paternity is first and foremost determined by one's culture. As Lacan said, ""The Name-of-the-Father creates the function of the father."" But then where does the plural stem from? It isn't pagan, for it is found in the Bible. He who speaks from the burning bush says of Himself that He doesn't have just one Name. In other words, the Father has no proper Name. It is not a figure of speech, but rather a function. The Father has as many names as the function has props. What is its function? The religious function par excellence, that of tying things together. What things? The signifier and the signified, law and desire, thought and the body. In short, the symbolic and the imaginary. Yet if these two become tied to the real in a three-part knot, the Name-of-the-Father is no longer anything but mere semblance. On the other hand, if without it everything falls apart, it is the symptom of a failed knotting.- Jacques-Alain Miller",3.82, , , ,1,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/563777.De_los_nombres_del_padre,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/563777.De_los_nombres_del_padre

By joining a fraternity? Getting a letter in football? Conquering a lot of women? Making a lot of money?<br /><br />With traditional notions of manhood under attack, today's men (and women) are looking for a new vision of masculinity. In this groundbreaking book, Sam Keen offers an inspiring guide for men seeking new personal ideals of strength, potency, and warrior-ship in their lives.<br /><br />What does it really mean to be a man? <i>Fire in the Belly</i> answers that question by daringly confronting outdated models that impoverish, injure, and alienate men. It shows instead how men can find their own path to understanding the unique mysteries of being male and in the process rediscover a new vitality and virility that will energize every aspect of their lives. Here is a look at men at work, at play, at war, and in love, moving from brokenness to wholeness and building nurturing, satisfying relationships with one another, their mates, and their families.<br /><br />At no time in history have there been so many men looking for new roles, new attitudes, and new ways of being. In this powerful and empowering book, author Sam Keen retells for modern times the ancient story of the search for what it means to be a man--a man with fire in his belly and passion in his heart.<br /><br /><b>""This book taught me things i didn't know, thawed out some feelings that had been frozen, and made me remember things I thought I wanted to forget.

It was the credo of the flamenco: a rejection of the mundane, the ordinary, the life of the everyday man, embracing, rather, an extreme world – extreme passions, extreme feelings, the extremes of life and death. And it was a way of life I wanted to believe in – its excitement, its danger, the affirmation it gave you that you were different, and alive.<br /><br /></i>Destined for a sedate and predictable life in academia, Jason Webster was derailed in his early twenties when his first love, an aloof Florentine beauty, dumped him unceremoniously. Loveless and eager for adventure – and determined to fulfill a secret dream -- he left Oxford and headed for Spain, the country that had long captivated his imagination, and set off in search of <i>duende</i>, the intense and mysterious emotional state – part ecstasy, part melancholy – that is the essence of Spain’s signature art form: flamenco.<br /><br /><i>Duende</i> is Webster’s captivating memoir of the years he spent in Spain pursuing his obsession. Studying flamenco guitar until his fingers bleed, he becomes involved in a passionate yet doomed affair with Lola, a flamenco dancer (and older woman) married to the gun-toting Vicente, only to flee the coastal city of Alicante in fear for his life. He ends up in Madrid, miserable and lovelorn, but it’s here that he has his first taste of the gritty world of flamenco’s progenitors – the Gypsies whose edgy lives and fervent commitment to the art of flamenco vividly illustrate the path to <i>duende</i>. Before long he is deeply immersed in a flamenco underworld that combines music and dance with drugs and crime. After two years Webster moves on to Granada where, bruised and battered, he reflects on his discovery of the emotional heart of Spain.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.78,336,Paperback, ,38,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/566968.Duende,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/566968.Duende

The book follows the thirteen lunar cycles of an agrarian year, from the midwinter Hunger Moon and the springtime sweetness of the Sap Moon to the bounty of the Moon When Salmon Return to Earth in autumn. Each chapter includes recipes that display the richly satisfying flavors of foods tied to the ancient rhythm of the seasons.<br /><br />Prentice decries our modern food culture: megafarms and factories, the chemically processed ghosts of real foods in our diets, and the suffering--physical, emotional, cultural, communal, and spiritual--born of a disconnect from our food sources. She laments the system that is poisoning our bodies and our communities.<br /><br />But <em>Full Moon Feast</em> is a celebration, not a dirge. Prentice has emerged from her own early struggles with food to offer health, nourishment, and fulfillment to her readers. She recounts her relationships with local farmers alongside ancient harvest legends and methods of food preparation from indigenous cultures around the world.<br /><br />Combining the radical nutrition of Sally Fallon's Nourishing Traditions, keen agri-political acumen, and a spiritual sensibility that draws from indigenous as well as Western traditions, <em>Full Moon Feast</em> is a call to reconnect to our food, our land, and each other.",4.21,344,Paperback, ,62,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/569319.Full_Moon_Feast,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/569319.Full_Moon_Feast

The total number of letters written over his lifetime probably exceeds 10,000. Their breadth is equally astonishing -- with friends and family, with politicians, children, and other private citizens, Reagan was as dazzling a communicator in letters as he was in person. Collectively, his letters reveal his character and thinking like no other source. He made candid, considerate, and tough statements that he rarely made in a public speech or open forum. He enjoyed responding to citizens, and comforting or giving advice or encouragement to friends. Now, the most astonishing of his writings, culled in Reagan: A Portrait in Letters, finally and fully reveal the true Ronald Reagan. Many of Reagan's handwritten letters are among the most thoughtful, charming, and moving documents he produced. Long letters to his daughter Patti, applauding her honesty, and son Ron Jr., urging him to be the best student he can be, reveal Reagan as a caring parent. Long-running correspondence with old friends, carried on for many decades, reveals the importance of his hometown and college networks. Heartfelt advice on love and marriage, fond memories of famous friends from Hollywood, and rare letters about his early career allow Reagan to tell his own full biography as never before. Running correspondence with young African-American student Ruddy Hines reveals a little-known presidential pen pal. The editors also reveal that another long-running pen-pal relationship, with fan club leader Lorraine Wagner, was initially ghostwritten by his mother, until Reagan began to write to Wagner himself someyears later. Reagan's letters are a political and historical treasure trove. Revealed here for the first time is a running correspondence with Richard Nixon, begun in 1959 and continuing until shortly before Nixon's death. Letters to key supporters reveal that Reagan was thinking of the presidency from the mid-1960s; that missile defense was of interest to him as early as the 1970s; and that few details of his campaigns or policies escaped his notice. Dozens of letters to constituents reveal Reagan to have been most comfortable and natural with pen in hand, a man who reached out to friend and foe alike throughout his life. Reagan: A Life in Letters is as important as it is astonishing and moving.",4.43,934,Hardcover, ,15,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/569557.Reagan,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/569557.Reagan

That made her just the right age: old enough to be used, young enough to be broken. Or so the slavers thought. But Sassy turned out to be a little different from your typical slave girl. Maybe it was her unusual physical strength. Maybe it was her friendship with the captured Fleet crewman. Maybe it was her spirit. Whatever it was, it wouldn't let her resign herself to the life of a slave. She bided her time, watched for her moment. Finally it came, and she escaped.<br /><br />But that was only the beginning for Sassinak.

Instead, Alaska has won its independence and established itself as a constitutional monarchy...and now, the King of Alaska badly needs a bride for his son and heir... The country of Alaska is as forbidding as it is beautiful. And the royal family is as rough-around-the-edges as they are coolly civilized. Other royal families may find them shocking, but after all, in this wilderness kingdom, being a crack shot and expert trapper is just as important as knowing your salad fork from your dessert fork. Unfortunately, when the rest of the royals find you mildly savage, marrying off your royal brood can be a royal pain. King Alexander II is desperate. Why, he'd settle for any girl. A commoner. An American, even! Stranded tourist Christina Krabbe is American, and a commoner, but she has zero interest in enduring a royal wedding, producing royal heirs, and becoming Queen of Alaska...until she gets a good look at Prince David. He may be a bit unruly--actually, the words untamed and slightly dangerous come to mind--but Christina's no delicate flower herself. And when His Highness discovers Christina can give as good as she gets, he's Prince Charmed, if not quite charming. But can a wild man Prince and a modern American girl make a life together?

Trout is a recurring character of many of the novels of Kurt Vonnegut. This book was first mentioned as a fictional work in <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i> ('65). Farmer's novel was 1st published in two parts beginning in the December, 1974 issue of <i>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</i>.<br /><br />According to Farmer's introduction in <i>Venus on the Half-Shell and Others</i>, Vonnegut was initially reluctant to allow the project, but finally relented. After publication, a poorly-worded magazine article gave Vonnegut the impression that Farmer had planned to write the story regardless of his permission, which angered Vonnegut. Also, it was popularly assumed that Vonnegut wrote the book. This problem was solved by the book being reprinted under Farmer's by-line.<br /><br />A common element to this novel is the origin of many of the characters' and locations' names. Farmer ""put in a lot of references to literature and fictional authors...

If institutions of male dominance profoundly influence women's lives and minds, how can women form judgments about their own best interests and overcome oppression? Can feminist politics survive in face of the diversity of women's experience, which is shaped by race, class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, as well as by gender? Exploring such questions, leading feminist thinkers have reinvigorated work on the concept of self and personal identity, as demonstrated by the discussions in this insightful volume.The concerns that animate feminist scholarship have prompted feminist philosophers to sideline the theme of individualism and to focus on the theme of intersubjectivity. In conceptualizing the self, the contributors to this volume highlight emotional bonds among people, the stories people tell one another, and the systems of categories and behavioral norms that unite and divide groups of people. Topics addressed include sexual violence and the self, the social self and autonomy, the narrative self and integrity, self-ownership and the body, forgetting yourself and your race, group membership and personal identity, grief and gender, sympathy and women's diversity, emotion and emancipatory epistemology, and dependency and justice.

Bush has proclaimed, have a special mission, derived from God, to bring liberty and democracy to the world? How much influence does the Christian right have over U.S. foreign policy? And how should America and the West deal with violent Islamist extremists? Traditionally, politicians have sought to downplay the impact of religious beliefs in international affairs. In this illuminating first-hand account, one of the most renowned figures in American politics argues that understanding the place and power of religion - and knowing how best to respond to it - is essential if America is to lead successfully around the world. Here, Madeleine Albright examines religion and foreign affairs through the lens of American history as well as her own personal experiences in public office, with a preface and opening chapters specially written for the UK edition. She offers a sharp critique of U.S. policy, condemnation for those who exploit religious fervor for violent ends, and praise for political, cultural, and spiritual leaders who seek to harness the values of faith to bring people together. Albright has written a thought-provoking work that calls for bold leadership to rein in the many religious rivalries around the globe and lay the groundwork for a new moral consensus.<br /><br />'Learned, eloquent and thoughtful...Much of what she says seems obvious except that it obviously hasn't been followed' Raymond Seitz, "" Sunday Telegraph""",3.79, ,Paperback, ,2,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583885.The_Mighty_and_the_Almighty,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583885.The_Mighty_and_the_Almighty

How did they get to be such sprawling conglomerations of lookalike subdivisions, megafreeways, and ""big box"" superstores surrounded by acres of parking lots? And why, most of all, don't they feel like real communities? These are the questions that Alex Marshall tackles in this hard-hitting, highly readable look at what makes cities work.<br /><br />Marshall argues that urban life has broken down because of our basic ignorance of the real forces that shape cities-transportation systems, industry and business, and political decision making. He explores how these forces have built four very different urban environments-the decentralized sprawl of California's Silicon Valley, the crowded streets of New York City's Jackson Heights neighborhood, the controlled growth of Portland, Oregon, and the stage-set facades of Disney's planned community, Celebration, Florida.<br /><br />To build better cities, Marshall asserts, we must understand and intelligently direct the forces that shape them. Without prescribing any one solution, he defines the key issues facing all concerned citizens who are trying to control urban sprawl and build real communities.

The intelligent and outspoken child of radical Marxists, and the great-grandaughter of Iran's last emperor, Satrapi bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. <i>Persepolis </i>paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Amidst the tragedy, Marjane's child's eye view adds immediacy and humour, and her story of a childhood at once outrageous and ordinary, beset by the unthinkable and yet buffered by an extraordinary and loving family, is immensely moving. It is also very beautiful; Satrapi's drawings have the power of the very best woodcuts.<br /><br /><i>Persepolis </i>ends on a cliffhanger in 1984, just as fourteen-year-old Marjane is leaving behind her home in Tehran, escaping fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in the West. In <i>Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return</i> we follow our young, intrepid heroine through the next eight years of her life: an eye-opening and sometimes lonely four years of high school in Vienna, followed by a supremely educational and heartwrenching four years back home in Iran. Just as funny and heartbreaking as its predecessor - with perhaps an even greater sense of the ridiculous inspired by life in a fundamentalist state - <i>Persepolis 2 </i>is also as clear-eyed and searing in its condemnation of fundamentalism and its cost to the human spirit. In its depiction of the universal trials of adolescent life and growing into adulthood - here compounded by being an outsider both abroad and at home, and by living in a state where you have no right to show your hair, wear make-up, run in public, date, or question authority - it's raw, honest, and incredibly illuminating.",4.37,343,Paperback, ,61,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587594.Persepolis,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/587594.Persepolis
